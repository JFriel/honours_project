returned to its status as a public park, in much better shape than its original swampy form.', u'The lagoon was reshaped to give it a more natural appearance, except for the straight-line northern end where it still laps up against the steps on the south side of the Palace of Fine Arts/Museum of Science & Industry building.', u'The Midway Plaisance, a park-like boulevard which extends west from Jackson Park, once formed the southern boundary of the University of Chicago, which was being built as the fair was closing (the university has since developed south of the Midway).', u'The university\'s football team, the Maroons, were the original "Monsters of the Midway".', u'The exposition is mentioned in the university\'s alma mater: "The City White hath fled the earth,/But where the azure waters lie,/A nobler city hath its birth,/The City Gray that ne\'er shall die."', u'== Electricity at the fair ==\n\nThe effort to power the Fair with electricity, which became a demonstration piece for Westinghouse Electric and the alternating current system they had been developing for many years, took place at the end of what has been called the War of the currents between DC and AC.', u'Westinghouse initially did not put in a bid to power the Fair but agreed to be the contractor for a local Chicago company that put in a low bid of US$510,000 to supply an alternating current based system.', u'Edison General Electric, which at the time was merging with the Thomson-Houston Electric Company to form General Electric, put in a US$1,720,000 bid to power the Fair and its planned 93,000 incandescent lamps with direct current.', u'After the Fair committee went over both proposals Edison General Electric re-bid their costs at $554,000 but Westinghouse under bid them by 70 cents per lamp to get the contract.', u'Westinghouse could not use the Edison incandescent lamp since the patent belonged to General Electric and they had successfully sued to stop use of all patent infringing designs.', u'Since Edison specified a sealed globe of glass in his design Westinghouse found a way to sidestep the Edison patent by quickly developing a lamp with a ground glass stopper in one end, based on a Sawyer-Man "stopper" lamp patent they already had.', u'The lamps worked well but were short lived, requiring a small army of workmen to constantly replace them.', u'Westinghouse Electric had severely underbid the contract and struggled to supply all the equipment specified including twelve 1,000 horsepower single phase AC generators and all the lighting and other equipment required.', u'They also had to fend off a last minute lawsuit by General Electric claiming the Westinghouse Sawyer-Man based stopper lamp infringed on the Edison incandescent lamp patent.', u'The International Exposition held an Electricity Building which was devoted to electrical exhibits.', u'A statue of Benjamin Franklin was displayed at the entrance.', u"The exposition featured interior and exterior light and displays as well as displays of Thomas Edison's kinetoscope, search lights, a seismograph, electric incubators for chicken eggs, and Morse code telegraph.", u'All the exhibits were from commercial enterprises.', u'Participants included General Electric, Brush, Western Electric, and Westinghouse.', u'The Westinghouse Company displayed several polyphase systems.', u'The exhibits included a switchboard, polyphase generators, step-up transformers, transmission line, step-down transformers, commercial size induction motors and synchronous motors, and rotary direct current converters (including an operational railway motor).', u'The working scaled system allowed the public a view of a system of polyphase power which could be transmitted over long distances, and be utilized, including the supply of direct current.', u'Meters and other auxiliary devices were also present.', u'Part of the space occupied by the Westinghouse Company was devoted to demonstrations of electrical devices developed by Nikola Tesla including a two-phase induction motor, and generators to power the system.', u'Tesla demonstrated a series of electrical effects, some which were in previous lectures performed in America and Europe.', u'This included using high-voltage, high-frequency alternating current to light a wireless gas-discharge lamp.', u'Also at the Fair, the Chicago Athletic Association Football team played one of the very first night football games against West Point (the earliest being on September 28, 1892 between Mansfield State Normal and Wyoming

{'sentences': [u'Tony Sheridan (Anthony Esmond Sheridan McGinnity; 21 May 1940 \u2013 16 February 2013) was an English rock and roll singer-songwriter and guitarist.', u'He was best known as an early collaborator of the Beatles (though the record was labelled as being with "The Beat Brothers"), one of two non-Beatles (the other being Billy Preston) to receive label performance credit on a record with the group, and the only non-Beatle to appear as lead singer on a Beatles recording which charted as a single.', u'== Biography ==\nSheridan was born in Norwich, Norfolk, where he grew up at 2 Hansell Road in Thorpe St Andrew and attended the City of Norwich School.', u"In his early life, Sheridan was influenced by his parents' interest in classical music, and by age seven, he had learned to play the violin.", u'He eventually came to play guitar, and in 1956, formed his first band.', u'He showed enough talent that he soon found himself playing in London\'s "Two I\'s" club for some six months straight.', u'In 1958, aged 18, he began appearing on Oh Boy, made by the ITV contractor ABC, playing electric guitar on such early rock classics as "Blue Suede Shoes", "Glad All Over", "Mighty Mighty Man" and "Oh Boy!".', u'He was soon employed backing a number of singers, reportedly including Gene Vincent and Conway Twitty while they were in England.', u"In 1958 Johnny Foster sought to recruit Sheridan as a guitar player in Cliff Richard's backing band (soon renamed the Shadows), but after failing to find him at the 2i's Coffee Bar opted for another guitarist who was there, Hank Marvin.", u'Early in 1960, he performed in a tour of the UK, along with Vincent and Eddie Cochran.', u'On 16 April, Vincent and Cochran rebuffed his request to ride along with them to the next venue, but he thereby escaped the road accident which would leave Cochran dead and Vincent badly injured.', u'Sheridan played guitar for Cherry Wainer on her recording of "Happy Organ".', u'Despite these successes, his penchant for being late, showing up without his guitar, etc., soon got him a reputation for having gone a bit "haywire", and cost him much of his professional standing in England.', u'Providentially, an offer for a gig came from Bruno Koschmider\'s "Kaiserkeller" club in Hamburg, Germany for an English group to play there.', u'Sheridan and others (including Colin "Melander" Crawley) joined an ad hoc group promptly dubbed "The Jets" and were put on the ship headed for Hamburg.', u'As fate would have it, legal woes (i.e.', u'lack of proper papers) caused "The Jets" to not last long, but Sheridan (and now-friend Colin "Melander" Crawley) were soon back onstage in Hamburg.', u'While performing in Hamburg between 1960 and 1963, Sheridan employed various backup bands, most of which were really "pickup bands", or simply an amalgam of various musicians, rather than a group proper (though almost always including now bassist Colin "Melander" Crawley).', u'However, in 1961, the young Beatles (with their line-up at the time of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Pete Best) who had met and admired Sheridan during their first visit to Hamburg in 1960, and who openly worked with him on their second visit, became even closer.', u'The Beatles sometimes backed Sheridan, who, in turn, often joined the Beatles during their own sets backing them on guitar.', u"They even visited Sheridan's home and had jamming sessions in the back garden \nWhen German Polydor producer/A and R man Bert Kaempfert saw the pairing on stage, he suggested that Sheridan and the Beatles make some recordings together.", u'Kaempfert viewed Sheridan as the one with "star" potential, and though they signed the Beatles to play on Sheridan\'s records their contract with them stipulated that the four Beatles (Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Best) were insured to play on a minimum of two songs.', u"Of the seven songs recorded during Sheridan's two-day-long sessions for Polydor in June 1961, it should be pointed out that at times the band behind Sheridan would be down to only two Beatles, and that conversely only on their two solo songs do all four Beatles play (minus Sheridan), while Sheridan plays on all of his tracks.", u"John Lennon's rhythm guitar is heard only on the two Beatle solo tracks (though his voice is heard in background vocals on Sheridan's tracks).", u'These sessions produced Sheridan\'s "My Bonnie" and "The Saints", and the Beatles\' "Ain\'t She Sweet" and "Cry for a Shadow" (formerly titled "Beatle Bop"), plus three other songs.', u"Polydor's beliefs in Sheridan's coming stardom were so strong that they buried the two solo Beatle tracks until much later.", u'Both John Lennon and Tony Sheridan swore that there were several other Beatle tracks that were recorded during the two-day session, but they have not resurfaced.', u'In 1962, after a series of singles (the first of which, "My Bonnie"/"The Saints" made it to number 5 in the German chart), the record was released in America on Decca with a black label and also in a pink label for demo play.', u'The record has the distinction of being one of the most expensive collectible 45 rpm with the black label in mint condition selling for $15,000 in 2007 and the pink label selling for $3000.', u"Ringo Starr briefly played in Sheridan's backing band during very early 1962, before returning to Rory Storm and the Hurricanes.", u"Starr was reportedly unhappy with Sheridan performing songs he had not rehearsed with his band (other musicians made the same complaint, as well as about Sheridan's penchant for fist-fights).", u'Also in 1962, Polydor released the album My Bonnie across Germany.', u'The word "Beatles" was judged to sound too similar to the Hamburgisch dialect word "Pidels" (pronounced "peedles"), the plural of a slang term for penis, hence the album was credited to "Tony Sheridan and the Beat Brothers".', u'Amusingly, that very unintentional-naughty-pun was one thing that so many young German fans had found amusing but enchanting.', u'After the Beatles had gained fame, the album was re-released in the United Kingdom, with the credit altered to "Tony Sheridan and the Beatles".', u"The Beatles' Hamburg studio recordings, as well as some live recordings from the same period, have been reissued many times.", u"In the mid-1960s, Sheridan's musical style underwent a drastic transformation, away from his rock and roll roots and towards a more blues- and jazz-oriented sound.", u'Though these recordings were praised by some, many fans of his earlier work felt wildly disappointed.', u'This change was presaged by liner notes from his 1964 album Just a Little Bit of Tony Sheridan in which his musical preferences are listed as "jazz and classical" rather than rock.', u'The liner notes also mention his wanting to visit the southern US "to hear at first hand the original negro music and experience the atmosphere that has been instrumental in creating negro jazz and the spiritual, for which he has a great liking."', u'Polydor continued releasing Sheridan singles through 1966 (though they only ever released two albums by him).', u'By 1967, Sheridan had become disillusioned with his Beatle-brought fame.', u'As he was more concerned by the Vietnam War and the thought of further Communist aggression, as such Sheridan agreed to perform for the Allied troops.', u'While in Vietnam however, the band that he had assembled was fired upon and one of the members was killed.', u'For his work entertaining the Allies, Sheridan was made an honorary Captain of the United States Army.', u'Due to the repeated shellings encountered there, Sheridan henceforth suffered a great sensitivity to the sounds of any kind of explosions, even fireworks.', u'With his Polydor contract gone Sheridan did what he could to survive.', u"In the early '70's he managed to cut a single as a pop duo teamed with Carole Bell, and they toured Europe together with fair success.", u'Following that phase he returned to playing in Germany (usually Hamburg) or London.', u'The mid-1970s, saw him deejaying a West German radio programme of blues music, which was well received.', u'Somehow he then managed to record an entire live album of early rock classics, a number of which had been part of his and the young Beatles early live act but of which had never gotten recorded.', u"Fortuitously in 1978 a record producer in America heard Sheridan's early Polydor recordings (with and without the young Beatles), and was enthralled by Tony's singing and playing.", u'Immediately Sheridan was offered and wisely accepted the offer to come and record a whole studio album in Los Angeles.', u"Making the entire thing sweeter was the fact that Elvis' (now out of work) TCB Band was hired to play on the album along with top bassist (and former Hamburg friend) Klaus Voormann.", u'A fine album of rock classics plus a few country tunes resulted, but with no major label release, it was doomed to direct TV sales.', u'Thus the possible prospect of a long American career in Las Vegas evaporated.', u"In 1978, the Star Club was reopened, and Sheridan performed there along with Elvis Presley's TCB Band.", u"In 1991, Joe Sunseri, Sheridan biographer and then-manager, completed Nobody's Child: The Tony Sheridan Story.", u'However, due to a falling-out, the biography remained unpublished.', u'A biography of Sheridan, titled The Teacher (ISBN 0957528507), was eventually published in 2013 by Norfolk author Alan Mann, a childhood-friend of Sheridan.', u'This book was essentially an email question and answer interview.', u"While repeated probings by the author did bring out Sheridan's one time of two weeks spent in an English jail, aside from that the author unfortunately takes Sheridan's memory of things at total face value.", u'On 13 August 2002, Sheridan released Vagabond, a collection largely of his own material, but also including a new cover version of "Skinny Minnie", a song he had years earlier recorded for his first album.', u'Tony played guitar and sang for the Argentinian rock musician Charly Garcia.', u'The album was called Influencia and it was released in 2002.', u'In 2015, Colin "Melander" Crawley - Sheridan\'s former bassist, published another biography, Tony Sheridan - The One The Beatles Called "The Teacher".', u"Of the two published biographies it definitely gives the most insight into Sheridan's major career of the early '60's.", u'== Other ==\nSheridan lived in Seesterm\xfche, a village north of Hamburg, and in addition to music, in his later life he was interested in heraldry and designed coats of arms.', u"Sheridan was extremely secretive about his personal life though it's known that he was married three times, lastly to the very young Anna Sievers, and previously to Rosi Heitmann and to Hazel Byng.", u'His friend and former bassist Colin "Melander" Crawley stated that in 1960 Sheridan confided that (despite his mixed Irish-Catholic and Jewish background) he was at that point viewing himself as a Buddhist.', u"Later in life Sheridan became a fervently devoted follower of the Hindu guru Bhagwan Sri Rajneesh (and lived for a while in the commune in the Pacific northwest in the '80's).", u'== Death ==\nTony Sheridan died on 16 February 2013 in Hamburg, after undergoing heart surgery.', u'== Discography ==\n1961: My Bonnie with The Beat Brothers (later corrected to read with The Beatles)\n1962: single "Ich Lieb\' Dich So

a rare LP on Philips.', u'As noted Sheridan is credited as "Dan Sherry" though HIS PICTURE is very clearly displayed on the front cover singing at \'The Star Club\' (with bassist Colin "Melander"

{'sentences': [u'The United States Marine Corps (USMC) is a branch of the United States Armed Forces responsible for providing power projection, using the mobility of the United States Navy, by Congressional mandate, to deliver rapidly, combined-arms task forces on land, at sea, and in the air.', u'The U.S. Marine Corps is one of the four armed service branches in the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States.', u'The current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the highest-ranking military officer in the U.S. armed forces, is a Marine Corps general.', u'The Marine Corps has been a component of the U.S. Department of the Navy since 30 June 1834, working closely with naval forces for training, transportation, and logistics.', u'The USMC operates posts on land and aboard sea-going amphibious warfare ships around the world.', u"Additionally, several of the Marines' tactical aviation squadrons, primarily Marine Fighter Attack squadrons, are also embedded in Navy carrier air wings and operate from the Navy's nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.", u'Two battalions of Continental Marines were formed on 10 November 1775 in Philadelphia as a service branch of infantry troops capable of fighting for independence both at sea and on shore.', u'The role of the Corps has since grown and evolved, expanding to aerial warfare and earning popular titles such as, "America\'s third air force", and, "second land army".', u'The United States Marine Corps has distinguished itself as it has served in the majority of American wars and armed conflicts, from its inception to the modern era, and attained prominence in the 20th century when its theories and practices of amphibious warfare proved prescient and ultimately formed the cornerstone of the Pacific theater of World War II.', u"By the mid-20th century, the U.S. Marine Corps had become a major theorist of and the world's dominant practitioner of amphibious warfare.", u'Its ability to rapidly respond on short notice to expeditionary crises gives it a strong role in the implementation and execution of American foreign policy.', u'As of 2016, the USMC has around 182,000 active duty members and some 38,500 reserve Marines.', u'It is the smallest of the U.S. Armed Forces within the U.S. DoD.', u'== Mission ==\nThe USMC serves as an expeditionary force-in-readiness.', u'As outlined in 10 U.S.C.', u'\xa7 5063 and as originally introduced under the National Security Act of 1947, it has three primary areas of responsibility:\nThe seizure or defense of advanced naval bases and other land operations to support naval campaigns;\nThe development of tactics, technique, and equipment used by amphibious landing forces in coordination with the Army and Air Force; and\nSuch other duties as the President may direct.', u"This last clause, while seemingly redundant given the President's position as Commander-in-chief, is a codification of the expeditionary responsibilities of the Marine Corps.", u'It derives from similar language in the Congressional acts "For the Better Organization of the Marine Corps" of 1834, and "Establishing and Organizing a Marine Corps" of 1798.', u'In 1951, the House of Representatives\' Armed Services Committee called the clause "one of the most important statutory \u2013 and traditional \u2013 functions of the Marine Corps."', u'It noted that the Corps has more often than not performed actions of a non-naval nature, including its famous actions in Tripoli, the War of 1812, Chapultepec, and numerous counter-insurgency and occupational duties (such as those in Central America), World War I, and the Korean War.', u'While these actions are not accurately described as support of naval campaigns nor as amphibious warfare, their common thread is that they are of an expeditionary nature, using the mobility of the Navy to provide timely intervention in foreign affairs on behalf of American interests.', u'In addition to its primary duties, the Marine Corps conducts Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure (VBSS) operations, as well as missions in direct support of the White House and the State Department.', u'The Marine Band, dubbed the "President\'s Own" by Thomas Jefferson, provides music for state functions at the White House.', u'Marines from Ceremonial Companies A & B, quartered in Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C., guard presidential retreats, including Camp David, and the Marines of the Executive Flight Detachment of HMX-1 provide helicopter transport to the President and Vice President, with the radio call signs "Marine One" and "Marine Two", respectively.', u'The Executive Flight Detachment also provides helicopter transport to Cabinet members and other VIPs.', u'By authority of the 1946 Foreign Service Act, the Marine Security Guards of the Marine Embassy Security Command provide security for American embassies, legations, and consulates at more than 140 posts worldwide.', u'The relationship between the Department of State and the U.S. Marine Corps is nearly as old as the corps itself.', u'For over 200 years, Marines have served at the request of various Secretaries of State.', u'After World War II, an alert, disciplined force was needed to protect American embassies, consulates, and legations throughout the world.', u'In 1947, a proposal was made that the Department of War furnish Marine Corps personnel for Foreign Service guard duty under the provisions of the Foreign Service Act of 1946.', u'A formal Memorandum of Agreement was signed between the Department of State and the Secretary of the Navy on December 15, 1948, and 83 Marines were deployed to overseas missions.', u'During the first year of the MSG program, 36 detachments were deployed worldwide.', u"=== Historical mission ===\nThe Marine Corps was founded to serve as an infantry unit aboard naval vessels and was responsible for the security of the ship and its crew by conducting offensive and defensive combat during boarding actions and defending the ship's officers from mutiny; to the latter end, their quarters on ship were often strategically positioned between the officers' quarters and the rest of the vessel.", u'Continental Marines manned raiding parties, both at sea and ashore.', u"America's first amphibious assault landing occurred early in the Revolutionary War on 3 March 1776 as the Marines gained control of Fort Montague and Fort Nassau, a British ammunition depot and naval port in New Providence, the Bahamas.", u'The role of the Marine Corps has expanded significantly since then; as the importance of its original naval mission declined with changing naval warfare doctrine and the professionalization of the naval service, the Corps adapted by focusing on formerly secondary missions ashore.', u'The Advanced Base Doctrine of the early 20th century codified their combat duties ashore, outlining the use of Marines in the seizure of bases and other duties on land to support naval campaigns.', u'Throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries, Marine detachments served aboard Navy cruisers, battleships and aircraft carriers.', u"Marine detachments (generally one platoon per cruiser, a company for battleships or carriers) served in their traditional duties as a ship's landing force, manning the ship's weapons and providing shipboard security.", u"Marine detachments were augmented by members of the ship's company for landing parties, such as in the First Sumatran Expedition of 1832, and continuing in the Caribbean and Mexican campaigns of the early 20th centuries.", u'Marines would develop tactics and techniques of amphibious assault on defended coastlines in time for use in World War II.', u'During World War II, Marines continued to serve on capital ships.', u'They often were assigned to man anti-aircraft batteries.', u'When gun cruisers were retired by the 1960s, the remaining Marine detachments were only seen on battleships and carriers.', u'Its original mission of providing shipboard security finally ended in the 1990s as the battleships were retired and nuclear weapons were withdrawn from deployment on aircraft carriers.', u'=== Capabilities ===\n\nThe Marine Corps fulfills a vital role in national security as an amphibious, expeditionary, air-ground combined arms task force, capable of forcible entry from the air, land, and sea.', u'It is capable of asymmetric warfare with conventional, irregular, and hybrid forces.', u'While the Marine Corps does not employ any unique combat arms, as a force it can rapidly deploy a combined-arms task force to almost anywhere in the world within days.', u'The basic structure for all deployed units is a Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) that integrates a ground combat element, an aviation combat element and a logistics combat element under a common command element.', u"While the creation of joint commands under the Goldwater\u2013Nichols Act has improved inter-service coordination between each branch, the Corps' ability to permanently maintain integrated multi-element task forces under a single command provides a smoother implementation of combined-arms warfare principles.", u'The close integration of disparate Marine units stems from an organizational culture centered on the infantry.', u'Every other Marine capability exists to support the infantry.', u'Unlike some Western militaries, the Corps remained conservative against theories proclaiming the ability of new weapons to win wars independently.', u'For example, Marine aviation has always been focused on close air support and has remained largely uninfluenced by air power theories proclaiming that strategic bombing can single-handedly win wars.', u'This focus on the infantry is matched with the doctrine of "Every Marine [is] a rifleman", a focus of Commandant Alfred M. Gray, Jr., emphasizing the infantry combat abilities of every Marine.', u'All Marines, regardless of military specialization, receive training as a rifleman; and all officers receive additional training as infantry platoon commanders.', u'For example, at Wake Island, when all of the Marine aircraft were shot down, pilots continued the fight as ground officers, leading supply clerks and cooks in a final defensive effort.', u'As a result, a large degree of initiative and autonomy is expected of junior Marines, particularly the NCOs (corporals and sergeants), as compared with many other military organizations.', u'The Marine Corps emphasizes authority and responsibility downward to a greater degree than the other military services.', u'Flexibility of execution is implemented via an emphasis on "commander\'s intent" as a guiding principle for carrying out orders; specifying the end state but leaving open the method of execution.', u'The amphibious assault techniques developed for World War II evolved, with the addition of air assault and maneuver warfare doctrine, into the current "Operational Maneuver from the Sea" doctrine of power projection from the seas.', u'The Marines are credited with the development of helicopter insertion doctrine and were the earliest in the American military to widely adopt maneuver-warfare principles which emphasize low-level initiative and flexible execution.', u"In light of recent warfare that has strayed from the Corps' traditional missions, it has renewed an emphasis on amphibious capabilities.", u'The Marine Corps relies on the Navy for sealift to provide its rapid deployment capabilities.', u'In addition to basing a third of the Fleet Marine Force in Japan, Marine Expeditionary Units (MEU) are typically stationed at sea.', u'This allows the ability to function as first responders to international incidents.', u'The United States Army maintains light infantry units capable of rapid worldwide deployment, but those units do not match the combined-arms integration of an MAGTF and lack the logistics that the Navy provides.', u'Therefore, the Marine Corps is often assigned to non-combat missions such as the evacuation of Americans from unstable countries and providing humanitarian relief during natural disasters.', u'In larger conflicts, Marines act as a stopgap, to get into and hold an area until larger units can be mobilized.', u'The Corps performed this role in World War I and the Korean War, where Marines were the first significant combat units deployed from the United States and held the line until the country could mobilize for war.', u'To aid rapid deployment, the Maritime Pre-Positioning System was developed: fleets of container ships are positioned throughout the world with enough equipment and supplies for a Marine Expeditionary Force to deploy for 30 days.', u'The USMC is planning to reduce its logistical requirements and by 2025 eliminate all liquid fuel use for Marine Expeditionary Forces, except for highly efficient vehicles.', u'=== Doctrine ===\nTwo small manuals published during the 1930s would establish USMC doctrine in two areas.', u'The Small Wars Manual laid the framework for Marine counter-insurgency operations from Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan while the Tentative Landing Operations Manual established the doctrine for the amphibious operations of World War II.', u'"Operational Maneuver from the Sea" is the current doctrine of power projection.', u'== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nThe United States Marine Corps traces its institutional roots to the Continental Marines of the American Revolutionary War, formed by Captain Samuel Nicholas by a resolution of the Second Continental Congress on 10 November 1775, to raise two battalions of Marines.', u"That date is regarded and celebrated as the date of the Marine Corps' birthday.", u'At the end of the American Revolution, both the Continental Navy and Continental Marines were disbanded in April 1783.', u'The institution itself would not be resurrected until 11 July 1798.', u'At that time, in preparation for the Quasi-War with France, Congress created the United States Marine Corps.', u'Marines had been enlisted by the War Department as early as August 1797 for service in the new-build frigates authorized by the Congressional "Act to provide a Naval Armament" of 18 March 1794, which specified the numbers of Marines to be recruited for each frigate.', u"The Marines' most famous action of this period occurred during the First Barbary War (1801\u20131805) against the Barbary pirates, when William Eaton and First Lieutenant Presley O'Bannon led eight Marines and 500 mercenaries in an effort to capture Tripoli.", u"Though they only reached Derna, the action at Tripoli has been immortalized in the Marines' hymn and the Mameluke Sword carried by Marine officers.", u'During the War of 1812, Marine naval detachments took part in some of the great frigate duels that characterized the war, which were the first and last engagements of the conflict.', u"Their most significant contribution, however, was holding the center of General Jackson's defensive line at the Battle of New Orleans, the final major battle and most one-sided engagement of the war.", u'With widespread news of the battle and the capture of the HMS Cyane, HMS Levant and HMS Penguin, the final engagements between British and American forces, the Marines had acquired a well-deserved reputation as expert marksmen, especially in defensive and ship-to-ship actions.', u'After the war, the Marine Corps fell into a malaise that ended with the appointment of Archibald Henderson as its fifth Commandant in 1820.', u'Under his tenure, the Corps took on expeditionary duties in the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, Key West, West Africa, the Falkland Islands, and Sumatra.', u"Commandant Henderson is credited with thwarting President Jackson's attempts to combine and integrate the Marine Corps with the Army.", u'Instead, Congress passed the Act for the Better Organization of the Marine Corps in 1834, stipulating that the Corps was part of the Department of the Navy as a sister service to the Navy.', u'This would be the first of many times that the existence of the Corps was challenged.', u'Commandant Henderson volunteered the Marines for service in the Seminole Wars of 1835, personally leading nearly half of the entire Corps (two battalions) to war.', u'A decade later, in the Mexican\u2013American War (1846\u20131848), the Marines made their famed assault on Chapultepec Palace in Mexico City, which would be later celebrated by the phrase "From The Halls of Montezuma" in Marines\' hymn.', u"In the 1850s, the Marines would see further service in Panama and Asia, escorting Matthew Perry's East India Squadron on its historic trip to the Far East.", u'With their vast service in foreign engagements, the Marine Corps played a moderate role in the Civil War (1861\u20131865); their most prominent task was blockade duty.', u"As more and more states seceded from the Union, about a third of the Corps' officers left the Union to join the Confederacy and form the Confederate States Marine Corps, which ultimately played little part in the war.", u'The battalion of recruits formed for the First Battle of Bull Run (First Manassas) performed poorly, retreating with the rest of the Union forces.', u'Blockade duty included sea-based amphibious operations to secure forward bases.', u'In late November 1861, Marines and sailors landed a reconnaissance in force from the USS Flag at Tybee Island, Georgia, to occupy the Lighthouse and Martello Tower on the northern end of the island.', u'It would later be the Army base for bombardment of Fort Pulaski.', u'=== American Civil War to World War I ===\nThe remainder of the 19th century was marked by declining strength and introspection about the mission of the Marine Corps.', u"The Navy's transition from sail to steam put into question the need for Marines on naval ships.", u'Meanwhile, Marines served as a convenient resource for interventions and landings to protect American lives and interests overseas.', u'The Corps was involved in over 28 separate interventions in the 30 years from the end of the American Civil War to the end of 19th century, with 148 U.S. Marines killed in action fighting against the Confederates in the U.S. Civil War.', u'They would be called upon to stem political and labor unrest within the United States.', u"Under Commandant Jacob Zeilin's tenure, Marine customs and traditions took shape: the Corps adopted the Marine Corps emblem on 19 November 1868.", u'It was during this time that "The Marines\' Hymn" was first heard.', u'Around 1883, the Marines adopted their current motto "Semper Fidelis" (Always Faithful).', u'John Philip Sousa, the musician and composer, enlisted as a Marine apprentice at the age of 13, serving from 1867 until 1872, and again from 1880 to 1892 as the leader of the Marine Band.', u'During the Spanish\u2013American War (1898), Marines led American forces ashore in the Philippines, Cuba, and Puerto Rico, demonstrating their readiness for deployment.', u'At Guant\xe1namo Bay, Cuba, the Marines seized an advanced naval base that remains in use today.', u'Between 1899 and 1916, the Corps continued its record of vigorous participation in foreign expeditions, including the Philippine\u2013American War, the Boxer Rebellion in China (1899\u20131901), Panama, the Cuban Pacifications, the Perdicaris Incident in Morocco, Veracruz, Santo Domingo, and the Banana Wars in Haiti and Nicaragua; the experiences gained in counter-insurgency and guerrilla operations during this period were consolidated into the Small Wars Manual.', u'=== World War I ===\n\nDuring World War I veteran Marines served a central role in the late American entry into the conflict, on 6 April 1917.', u'The Marine Corps had a deep pool of officers and NCOs with battle experience, and experienced a small expansion.', u"During the war, the Marines, fighting on the Western Front in France, fought their famed battle at Belleau Wood, creating the Marines' reputation in modern history.", u"While its previous expeditionary experiences had not earned it much acclaim in the Western world, the Marines' ferocity and toughness in France earned them the respect of the Germans.", u'Though Marines and American media reported that Germans had nicknamed them Teufel Hunden as meaning "Devil Dogs", for their reputation as shock troops and marksmen at ranges up to 900 meters, there is no evidence of this in German records (as Teufelshunde would be the proper German phrase).', u'Nevertheless, the name stuck.', u'The Corps entered the war with 511 officers and 13,214 enlisted personnel, and by 11 November 1918 had reached a strength of 2,400 officers and 70,000 enlisted.', u'African-Americans were entirely excluded from the Marine Corps during this conflict.', u'Opha May Johnson was the first woman to enlist in the Marines; she joined the Marine Corps Reserve in 1918 during World War I, officially becoming the first female Marine.', u'From then until the end of World War I, 305 women enlisted in the Corps.', u'Between the World Wars, the Marine Corps was headed by Commandant John A. Lejeune, and under his leadership, the Corps presciently studied and developed amphibious techniques that would be of great use in World War II.', u'Many officers, including Lieutenant Colonel Earl Hancock "Pete" Ellis, foresaw a war in the Pacific with Japan and undertook preparations for such a conflict.', u'Through 1941, as the prospect of war grew, the Corps pushed urgently for joint amphibious exercises and acquired amphibious equipment that would prove of great use in the upcoming conflict.', u'=== World War II ===\n\n.', u'In World War II, the Marines played a central role in the Pacific War.', u'The battles of Guadalcanal, Bougainville, Tarawa, Guam, Tinian, Cape Gloucester, Saipan, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa saw fierce fighting between Marines and the Imperial Japanese Army.', u'The island of Iwo Jima served as the next area of battle, which began on 19 February 1945.', u'The Japanese had learned from their defeats in the Marianas campaign and prepared many fortified positions on the island, including pillboxes and underground tunnels.', u'The Japanese put up fierce resistance, but American forces reached the summit of Mount Suribachi on 23 February.', u'The mission was accomplished at very high losses, with 26,000 American casualties and 22,000 Japanese.', u'By the end of the war, the Corps expanded from two brigades to six divisions, five air wings, and supporting troops, totaling about 485,000 Marines.', u'In addition, 20 defense battalions and a parachute battalion were set raised.', u'Nearly 87,000 Marines were casualties during World War II (including nearly 20,000 killed), and 82 were awarded the Medal of Honor.', u"Despite Secretary Forrestal's prediction, the Corps faced an immediate institutional crisis following the war due to the low budget.", u'Army generals pushing for a strengthened and reorganized defense establishment attempted to fold the Marine mission and assets into the Navy and Army.', u'Drawing on hastily assembled Congressional support, and with the assistance of the so-called "Revolt of the Admirals", the Marine Corps rebuffed such efforts to dismantle the Corps, resulting in statutory protection of the Marine Corps in the National Security Act of 1947.', u'Shortly afterward, in 1952 the Douglas\u2013Mansfield Act afforded the Commandant an equal voice with the Joint Chiefs of Staff on matters relating to the Marines and established the structure of three active divisions and air wings that remain today.', u'=== Korean War ===\n\nThe Korean War (1950\u20131953) saw the hastily formed Provisional Marine Brigade holding the defensive line at the Pusan Perimeter.', u'To execute a flanking maneuver, General Douglas MacArthur called on Marine air and ground forces to make an amphibious landing at Inchon.', u"The successful landing resulted in the collapse of North Korean lines and the pursuit of North Korean forces north near the Yalu River until the entrance of the People's Republic of China into the war.", u'Chinese troops surrounded, surprised and overwhelmed the overextended and outnumbered American forces.', u"X Corps, which included the 1st Marine Division and the Army's 7th Infantry Division, regrouped and inflicted heavy casualties during their fighting withdrawal to the coast, now known as the Battle of Chosin Reservoir.", u'The fighting calmed after the Battle of the Chosin Reservoir, but late in March 1953 the relative quiet of the war was broken when the Chinese Army launched a massive offensive on three outposts manned by the 5th Marine Regiment.', u'These outposts were codenamed "Reno", "Vegas", and "Carson".', u'The campaign was collectively known as the Nevada Cities Campaign.', u'There was brutal fighting on Reno hill, which was eventually captured by the Chinese.', u'Although Reno was lost, the 5th Marines held both Vegas and Carson through the rest of the campaign.', u'In this one campaign, the Marines suffered approximately 1,000 casualties, while the Chinese suffered at least twice as many.', u'Marines would continue a battle of attrition around the 38th Parallel until the 1953 armistice.', u'The Korean War saw the Corps expand from 75,000 regulars to a force of 261,000 Marines, mostly reservists.', u'30,544 Marines were killed or wounded during the war and 42 were awarded the Medal of Honor.', u'=== Vietnam War ===\n\nThe Marine Corps served an important role in the Vietnam War taking part in such battles as the Battle of Hue and the Battle of Khe Sanh in 1968.', u'Individuals from the USMC generally operated in the Northern I Corps Regions of South Vietnam.', u'While there, they were constantly engaged in a guerrilla war against the Viet Cong, along with an intermittent conventional war against the North Vietnamese Army (NVA).', u'Portions of the Corps were responsible for the less-known Combined Action Program (CAP) that implemented unconventional techniques for counter-insurgency and worked as military advisers to the Republic of Vietnam Marine Corps.', u'Marines were withdrawn in 1971, and returned briefly in 1975 to evacuate Saigon and attempt a rescue of the crew of the Mayag\xfcez.', u'Vietnam was the longest war for Marines; by its end, 13,091 had been killed in action, 51,392 had been wounded, and 57 Medals of Honor had been awarded.', u'Due to policies concerning rotation, more Marines were deployed for service during Vietnam than World War II.', u'While recovering from Vietnam, the Corps hit a detrimental low point in its service history caused by courts-martial and non-judicial punishments related partially to increased unauthorized absences and desertions during the war.', u'Overhauling of the Corps began in the late 1970s, discharging the most delinquent, and once quality of new recruits improved, the Corps focused on reforming the NCO Corps, a vital functioning part of its forces.', u'=== Interim: Vietnam War to the War on Terrorism ===\n\nAfter the Vietnam War, the U.S. Marines resumed their expeditionary role, participating in the failed 1980 Iran hostage rescue attempt Operation Eagle Claw, the invasion of Grenada (Operation Urgent Fury) and the invasion of Panama (Operation Just Cause).', u'On 23 October 1983, the Marine headquarters building in Beirut, Lebanon, was bombed, causing the highest peacetime losses to the Corps in its history (220 Marines and 21 other service members were killed) and leading to the American withdrawal from the country.', u'The year 1990 saw Marines of the Joint Task Force Sharp Edge save thousands of lives by evacuating British, French and American nationals from the violence of the Liberian Civil War.', u'During the Gulf War (1990\u20131991), Marine task forces formed the initial core for Operation Desert Shield, while United States and Coalition troops mobilized, and later liberated Kuwait in Operation Desert Storm.', u'Marines participated in combat operations in Somalia (1992\u20131995) during Operations Restore Hope, Restore Hope II, and United Shield to provide humanitarian relief.', u'In 1997, Marines took part in Operation Silver Wake, the evacuation of American citizens from the US Embassy in Tirana, Albania.', u'=== Global War on Terrorism ===\n\nFollowing the attacks on 11 September 2001, President George W. Bush announced the Global War on Terrorism.', u'The stated objective of the Global War on Terror is "the defeat of Al-Qaeda, other terrorist groups and any nation that supports or harbors terrorists."', u'Since then, the Marine Corps, alongside other military and federal agencies, has engaged in global operations around the world in support of that mission.', u"In spring 2009, President Barack Obama's goal of reducing spending in the Defense Department was led by Secretary Robert Gates in a series of budget cuts which did not result in significant changes in the Corps' budget and programs, cutting only the VH-71 Kestrel and resetting the VXX program.", u'However, the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform singled the Corps out for the brunt of a series of recommended cuts in late 2010.', u'In light of budget sequestration in 2013, commandant Amos set a goal of a force of 174,000 Marines.', u'He testified that this was the minimum number that would allow for an effective response to even a single contingency operation, but it would reduce the peacetime ratio of time at home bases to time deployed down to a historical low level.', u'==== Afghanistan Campaign (Operation Enduring Freedom-Afghanistan) ====\n\nMarines and other American forces began staging in Pakistan and Uzbekistan on the border of Afghanistan as early as October 2001 in preparation for Operation Enduring Freedom.', u'The 15th and 26th Marine Expeditionary Units were the first conventional forces into Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in November 2001, and in December, the Marines seized Kandahar International Airport.', u'Since then, Marine battalions and squadrons have been rotating through, engaging Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces.', u'Marines of the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit flooded into the Taliban-held town of Garmsir on 29 April 2008, in Helmand Province, in the first major American operation in the region in years.', u'In June 2009, 7,000 Marines with the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade deployed to Afghanistan in an effort to improve security, and began Operation Strike of the Sword the next month.', u'In February 2010, the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade launched the largest offensive of the Afghan Campaign since 2001, the Battle of Marjah, to clear the Taliban from their key stronghold in Helmand Province.', u'After Marjah, Marines progressed north up the Helmand River and cleared the towns of Kajahki and Sangin.', u'Marines remained in Helmand Province until 2014.', u"==== Iraq Campaign (Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation New Dawn, Operation Inherent Resolve) ====\n\nThe U.S. Marines served prominently in the Iraq War's Operation Iraqi Freedom.", u"The I Marine Expeditionary Force, along with the U.S. Army's 3rd Infantry Division, spearheaded the 2003 invasion of Iraq.", u'The Marines left Iraq in the summer of 2003, but returned for occupation duty in the beginning of 2004.', u'They were given responsibility for the Al Anbar Province, the large desert region to the west of Baghdad.', u"During this occupation, the Marines spearheaded both assaults on the city of Fallujah in April (Operation Vigilant Resolve) and November 2004 (Operation Phantom Fury) and saw intense fighting in such places as Ramadi, Al-Qa'im and H\u012bt.", u'Their time in Iraq has courted controversy with the Haditha killings and the Hamdania incident.', u'The Anbar Awakening and 2007 surge reduced levels of violence.', u'On 1 March 2009, at Camp Lejeune, President Obama announced an accelerated withdrawal, promising all troops out by August 2010.', u'The Marine Corps officially ended its role in Iraq on 23 January 2010 when they handed over responsibility for Al Anbar Province to the United States Army.', u'US Marines would ultimately return to Iraq in the summer of 2014, in response to growing violence there.', u'Horn of Africa Operations\nThroughout the Global War on Terrorism, the US Marines have supported operations in Africa to counter Islamic extremism and piracy in the Red Sea.', u'In late 2002, Combined Joint Task Force \u2013 Horn of Africa was stood up at Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti to provide regional security.', u'Despite transferring overall command to the Navy in 2006, the Marines continued to operate in the Horn of Africa into 2007.', u'See Operation Enduring Freedom- Horn of Africa.', u'== Organization ==\n\n\n=== Department of the Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps ===\nThe Department of the Navy, led by the Secretary of the Navy, is the service-level department of the cabinet-level U.S. Department of Defense that oversees the Marine Corps and the Navy.', u'The most senior Marine officer is the Commandant, responsible to the Secretary of the Navy for organizing, recruiting, training, and equipping the Marine Corps so that its forces are ready for deployment under the operational command of the Combatant Commanders.', u'The Marine Corps is organized into four principal subdivisions: Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC), the Operating Forces, the Supporting Establishment, and the Marine Forces Reserve (MARFORRES or USMCR).', u'=== Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC) ===\nHeadquarters Marine Corps consists of the Commandant of the Marine Corps, the Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps, the Director Marine Corps Staff, the several Deputy Commandants, the Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps, and various special staff officers and Marine Corps agency heads that report directly to either the Commandant or Assistant Commandant.', u'HQMC is supported by the Headquarters and Service Battalion, USMC providing administrative, supply, logistics, training, and services support to the Commandant and his staff.', u'=== Operating Forces ===\nThe Operating Forces are divided into three categories: Marine Corps Forces (MARFOR) assigned to unified commands (viz., the Fleet Marine Forces (FMF), Security Forces guarding high-risk naval installations, and Security Guard detachments at American embassies.', u'Under the "Forces for Unified Commands" memo, in accordance with the Unified Command Plan approved by the President, Marine Corps Forces are assigned to each of the Combatant Commands at the discretion of the Secretary of Defense.', u'Since 1991, the Marine Corps has maintained component headquarters at each of the regional unified combatant commands.', u'Marine Corps Forces are divided into Forces Command (MARFORCOM) and Pacific Command (MARFORPAC), each headed by a Lieutenant General dual-posted as the commanding general of either FMF Atlantic (FMFLANT) or FMF Pacific (FMFPAC), respectively.', u'MARFORCOM/FMFLANT has operational control of the II Marine Expeditionary Force; MARFORPAC/FMFPAC has operational control of the I Marine Expeditionary Force and III Marine Expeditionary Force.', u'==== Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) ====\n\nThe basic framework for deployable Marine units is the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF), a flexible structure of varying size.', u'A MAGTF integrates a ground combat element (GCE), an aviation combat element (ACE), and a logistics combat element (LCE) under a common command element (CE), capable of operating independently or as part of a larger coalition.', u'The MAGTF structure reflects a strong tradition in the Corps towards self-sufficiency and a commitment to combined arms, both essential assets to an expeditionary force often called upon to act independently in discrete, time-sensitive situations.', u'The history of the Marine Corps as well has led to a wariness of over reliance on its sister services, and towards joint operations in general.', u'=== Supporting Establishment ===\nThe Supporting Establishment includes the Combat Development Command, the Logistics Command, the Systems Command, the Recruiting Command, the Installations Command, and the Marine Band.', u'==== Marine Corps bases and stations ====\n\nThe Marine Corps operates many major bases, 14 of which host operating forces, several support and training installations, as well as satellite facilities.', u"Marine Corps' bases are concentrated around the locations of the Marine Expeditionary Forces, though reserve units are scattered throughout the United States.", u'The principal bases are Camp Pendleton on the West Coast, home to I MEF; Camp Lejeune on the East Coast, home to II MEF; and Camp Butler in Okinawa, Japan, home to III MEF.', u'Other important bases include air stations, recruit depots, logistics bases, and training commands.', u"Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms in California is the Marine Corps' largest base and home to the Corps' most complex, combined-arms, live-fire training.", u'Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia is home to Marine Corps Combat Development Command, and nicknamed the "Crossroads of the Marine Corps".', u'The Marine Corps maintains a significant presence in the National Capital Region, with Headquarters Marine Corps scattered amongst the Pentagon, Henderson Hall, Washington Navy Yard, and Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C. Additionally, Marines operate detachments at many installations owned by other branches, to better share resources, such as specialty schools.', u'Marines are also present at, and operate many, forward bases during expeditionary operations.', u'=== Marine Forces Reserve (MARFORRES/USMCR) ===\nMarine Forces Reserve consists of the Force Headquarters Group, 4th Marine Division, 4th Marine Aircraft Wing, and the 4th Marine Logistics Group.', u'The MARFORRES/USMCR is capable of forming a 4th Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) or reinforcing/augmenting active-duty forces.', u'== Special Operations ==\n\nMarine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC) includes: the Marine Raider Regiment, the Marine Raider Support Group, and the Marine Special Operations School.', u'Both the Raider Regiment and the Raider Support Group consist of a headquarters company and three operations battalions.', u'The Special Operations School conducts screening, assessment, selection, training and development functions for MARSOC units.', u'Marine Corps Special Operations Capable forces include: Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Companies, the Chemical Biological Incident Response Force, the Marine Division Reconnaissance Battalions, Force Reconnaissance Companies, Maritime Special Purpose Force, and Special Reaction Teams.', u'Additionally, all deployed Marine Expeditionary Units are certified as "Special Operations Capable", viz.', u'"MEU(SOC)".', u'Although the notion of a Marine special forces contribution to the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) was considered as early as the founding of USSOCOM in the 1980s, it was resisted by the Marine Corps.', u'Then-Commandant Paul X. Kelley expressed the popular belief that Marines should support Marines, and that the Corps should not fund a special operations capability that would not support Marine operations.', u'However, much of the resistance from within the Corps dissipated when Marine leaders watched the Corps\' 15th and 26th MEU(SOC)s "sit on the sidelines" during the very early stages of Operation Enduring Freedom while other special operations units actively engaged in operations in Afghanistan.', u'After a three-year development period, the Corps agreed in 2006 to supply a 2,500-strong unit, Marine Forces Special Operations Command, which would answer directly to USSOCOM.', u'== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== Leadership ===\n\nAs stated above, the Commandant of the Marine Corps is the highest-ranking officer of the Marine Corps; though he may not be the senior officer by time in grade and/or position of office.', u'He is both the symbolic and functional head of the Corps, and holds a position of very high esteem among Marines.', u'The Commandant has the U.S. Code Title 10 responsibility to man, train, and equip the Marine Corps.', u'He does not serve as a direct battlefield commander.', u'The Commandant is a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and reports to the Secretary of the Navy.', u'The Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps acts as a deputy to the Commandant.', u'The Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps is the senior enlisted Marine, and acts as an adviser to the Commandant.', u"Headquarters Marine Corps comprises the rest of the Commandant's counsel and staff, with deputy Commandants that oversee various aspects of the Corps assets and capabilities.", u'The current and 37th Commandant is Robert Neller, who assumed the position on 30 September 2015.', u'The 33rd and current Assistant Commandant is John M. Paxton, Jr., while the 18th and current Sergeant Major is Ronald L. Green.', u'Other Marine generals may be senior to the Commandant or Assistant Commandant in terms of time in grade and/or billet.', u'=== Rank structure ===\n\nAs in the rest of the United States military, Marine Corps ranks fall into one of three categories: commissioned officer, warrant officer, and enlisted, in decreasing order of authority (excluding the Air Force, which does not currently appoint warrant officers).', u'To standardize compensation, each rank is assigned a pay grade.', u'==== Commissioned officers ====\nCommissioned officers are distinguished from other officers by their commission, which is the formal written authority, issued in the name of the President of the United States, that confers the rank and authority of a Marine officer.', u'Commissioned officers carry the "special trust and confidence" of the President of the United States.', u'Marine Corps commissioned officers are promoted based on an "up or out" system in accordance with the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act of 1980.', u'==== Warrant officers ====\n\nWarrant officers are primarily former enlisted experts in a specific specialized field and provide leadership generally only within that speciality.', u'==== Enlisted ====\nEnlisted Marines in the pay grades E-1 to E-3 make up the bulk of the Corps\' ranks, usually referred to simply as "Marines".', u"Although they do not technically hold leadership ranks, the Corps' ethos stresses leadership among all Marines, and junior Marines are often assigned responsibility normally reserved for superiors.", u'Those in the pay grades of E-4 and E-5 are non-commissioned officers (NCOs).', u'They primarily supervise junior Marines and act as a vital link with the higher command structure, ensuring that orders are carried out correctly.', u'Marines E-6 and higher are Staff Non-Commissioned Officers (SNCOs), charged with supervising NCOs and acting as enlisted advisers to the command.', u'The E-8 and E-9 levels have two and three ranks per pay grade, respectively, each with different responsibilities.', u'The First Sergeant and Sergeant Major ranks are command-oriented, serving as the senior enlisted Marines in a unit, charged to assist the commanding officer in matters of discipline, administration and the morale and welfare of the unit.', u'Master Sergeants and Master Gunnery Sergeants provide technical leadership as occupational specialists in their specific MOS.', u'The Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps also E-9, is a billet conferred on the senior enlisted Marine of the entire Marine Corps, personally selected by the Commandant.', u'It is possible however for an enlisted Marine to hold a position senior to Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps as has been the case since the 2011 appointment of Sergeant Major Bryan B. Battaglia to the billet of Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman which is deemed the senior enlisted member of the United States military.', u'Different forms of address can be found at United States Marine Corps rank insignia and List of United States Marine Corps acronyms and expressions.', u'=== Military Occupational Specialty ===\n\nThe Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) is a system of job classification.', u'Using a four digit code, it designates what field and specific occupation a Marine performs.', u'Segregated between officer and enlisted, the MOS determines the staffing of a unit.', u"Some MOSs change with rank to reflect supervisory positions, others are secondary and represent a temporary assignment outside of a Marine's normal duties or special skill.", u'In late June 2016, it was reported that the Marine Corps will be removing the word "man" from 19 key job titles.', u'For example, Basic Infantryman will change to Basic Infantry Marine.', u'Rifleman was to remain unchanged.', u'=== Initial training ===\n\nEvery year, over 2,000 new Marine officers are commissioned, and 38,000 recruits accepted and trained.', u'All new Marines, enlisted or officer, are recruited by the Marine Corps Recruiting Command.', u'Commissioned officers are commissioned mainly through one of three sources: Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC), Officer Candidates School (OCS), or the United States Naval Academy (USNA).', u'Following commissioning, all Marine commissioned officers, regardless of accession route or further training requirements, attend The Basic School (TBS) at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia.', u'At TBS, second lieutenants, warrant officers, and selected foreign officers learn the art of infantry and combined arms warfare.', u'Enlisted Marines attend recruit training, known as boot camp, at either Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego or Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island.', u'Historically, the Mississippi River served as the dividing line which delineated who would be trained where, while more recently, a district system has ensured a more even distribution of male recruits between the two MCRD facilities.', u'Females attend only the Parris Island depot as part of the segregated Fourth Recruit Training Battalion.', u'All recruits must pass a fitness test to start training; those who fail receive individualized attention and training until the minimum standards are reached.', u"Marine recruit training is the longest among the American military services; it is 13 weeks long including processing and out-processing, compared to the Army's 10 weeks, the Navy's 9 weeks, the Air Forces's 8 1/2 weeks, and the Coast Guard's 8 weeks.", u'Following recruit training, enlisted Marines then attend The School of Infantry at Camp Geiger or Camp Pendleton.', u'Infantry Marines begin their combat training, which varies in length, immediately with the Infantry Training Battalion (ITB).', u'Marines in all other MOSs other than infantry train for 29 days in Marine Combat Training (MCT), learning common infantry skills, before continuing on to their MOS schools which vary in length.', u'== Uniforms ==\n\nThe Marine Corps has the most stable and most recognizable uniforms in the American military; the Blue Dress dates back to the early 19th century and the service uniform to the early 20th century.', u"Marines' uniforms are distinct in their simplicity; Marines do not wear unit patches or United States flags on any of their uniforms, nor name tags on their service and formal uniforms.", u'Only a handful of skills (parachutist, air crew, explosive ordnance disposal, etc.)', u"warrant distinguishing badges, and rank insignia is not worn on uniform headgear (with the exception of an officer's garrison service cover).", u'While other servicemembers commonly identify with a sub-group as much as or more than their service (Ranger, submariner, aircrew, etc.', u'), Marine uniforms do not reflect such division.', u'Marines have four main uniforms: Dress, Service, Utility, and Physical Training (PT).', u'These uniforms have a few minor, but very distinct, variations from enlisted personnel to commissioned and non-commissioned officers.', u'The Marine Corps Dress uniform is the most elaborate, worn for formal or ceremonial occasions.', u'There are four different forms of the Dress uniform.', u'The variations of the dress uniforms are known as "Alphas", "Bravos", "Charlies", or "Deltas".', u'The most common being the "Blue Dress Alphas or Bravos", called "Dress Blues" or simply "Blues".It is most often seen in recruiting advertisements and is equivalent to black tie.', u'There is a "Blue-White" Dress for summer, and Evening Dress for formal (white tie) occasions.', u'Versions with a khaki shirt in lieu of the coat (Blue Dress Charlie/Delta) are worn as a daily working uniform by Marine recruiters and NROTC staff.', u'The Service Uniform was once the prescribed daily work attire in garrison; however, it has been largely superseded in this role by the utility uniform.', u'Consisting of olive green and khaki colors, it is commonly referred to as "Greens".', u'It is roughly equivalent in function and composition to a business suit.', u'The Utility Uniform, currently the Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform, is a camouflage uniform intended for wear in the field or for dirty work in garrison, though it has now been standardized for regular duty.', u"It is rendered in a distinctive MARPAT pixelated camouflage (sometimes referred to as digitals or digies) that breaks up the wearer's shape, and serves to distinguish Marine uniforms from those of other services.", u"In garrison, the woodland and desert uniforms are worn depending on the Marine's duty station.", u'Marines consider the utilities a working uniform and do not permit their wear off-base, except in transit to and from their place of duty and in the event of an emergency.', u'This, too, distinguishes them from other services, which have less stringent restrictions.', u'== Culture ==\n\nAs in any military organization, the official and unofficial traditions of the Marine Corps serve to reinforce camaraderie and set the service apart from others.', u"The Corps' embrace of its rich culture and history is cited as a reason for its high esprit de corps.", u"=== Official traditions and customs ===\nThe Marines' Hymn dates back to the 19th century and is the oldest official song in the United States armed forces.", u'The Marine motto Semper Fidelis means always faithful in Latin, often appearing as Semper Fi; also the name of the official march of the Corps, composed by John Philip Sousa.', u'The mottos "Fortitudine" (With Fortitude); By Sea and by Land, a translation of the Royal Marines\' Per Mare, Per Terram;

continue.', u"Japan exploited Vietnam's natural resources to support its military campaigns, culminating in a full-scale takeover of the country in March 1945 and the Vietnamese Famine of 1945, which caused up to two million deaths.", u'=== 1946\u201354: First Indochina War ===\n\nIn 1941, the Viet Minh \u2013 a communist and nationalist liberation movement \u2013 emerged under the Marxist\u2013Leninist revolutionary Ho Chi Minh, who sought independence for Vietnam from France and the end of the Japanese occupation.', u'Following the military defeat of Japan and the fall of its puppet Empire of Vietnam in August 1945, the Viet Minh occupied Hanoi and proclaimed a provisional government, which asserted national independence on 2 September.', u'In the same year, the Provisional Government of the French Republic sent the French Far East Expeditionary Corps to restore colonial rule, and the Viet Minh began a guerrilla campaign against the French in late 1946.', u'The resulting First Indochina War lasted until July 1954.', u'The defeat of French and Vietnamese loyalists in the 1954 Battle of Dien Bien Phu allowed Ho Chi Minh to negotiate a ceasefire from a favorable position at the subsequent Geneva Conference.', u'The colonial administration was ended and French Indochina was dissolved under the Geneva Accords of 1954, which separated the loyalist forces from the communists at the 17th parallel north with the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone.', u"Two states formed after the partition \u2013 Ho Chi Minh's Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the north and Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i's State of Vietnam in the south.", u'A 300-day period of free movement was permitted, during which almost a million northerners, mainly Catholics, moved south, fearing persecution by the communists.', u'The partition of Vietnam was not intended to be permanent by the Geneva Accords, which stipulated that Vietnam would be reunited after elections in 1956.', u"However, in 1955, the State of Vietnam's Prime Minister, Ng\xf4 \u0110\xecnh Di\u1ec7m, toppled B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i in a fraudulent referendum organised by his brother Ng\xf4 \u0110\xecnh Nhu, and proclaimed himself president of the Republic of Vietnam.", u"=== 1954\u20131975: Vietnam War ===\n\nThe pro-Hanoi Viet Cong began a guerrilla campaign in the late 1950s to overthrow Di\u1ec7m's government.", u'Between 1953 and 1956, the North Vietnamese government instituted various agrarian reforms, including "rent reduction" and "land reform," which resulted in significant political oppression.', u'During the land reform, testimony from North Vietnamese witnesses suggested a ratio of one execution for every 160 village residents, which extrapolated nationwide would indicate nearly 100,000 executions.', u'Because the campaign was concentrated mainly in the Red River Delta area, a lower estimate of 50,000 executions became widely accepted by scholars at the time.', u'However, declassified documents from the Vietnamese and Hungarian archives indicate that the number of executions was much lower than reported at the time, although likely greater than 13,500.', u'In 1960 and 1962, the Soviet Union and North Vietnam signed treaties providing for further Soviet military support.', u'In the South, Di\u1ec7m countered North Vietnamese subversion (including the assassination of over 450 South Vietnamese officials in 1956) by detaining tens of thousands of suspected communists in "political reeducation centers."', u'This was a ruthless program that incarcerated many non-communists, although it was also successful at curtailing communist activity in the country, if only for a time.', u'The North Vietnamese government claimed that 2,148 individuals were killed in the process by November 1957.', u'In 1960 and 1962, the Soviet Union and North Vietnam signed treaties providing for further Soviet military support.', u"In 1963, Buddhist discontent with Di\u1ec7m's regime erupted into mass demonstrations, leading to a violent government crackdown.", u"This led to the collapse of Di\u1ec7m's relationship with the United States, and ultimately to the 1963 coup in which Di\u1ec7m and Nhu were assassinated.", u'The Di\u1ec7m era was followed by more than a dozen successive military governments, before the pairing of Air Marshal Nguy\u1ec5n Cao K\u1ef3 and General Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u took control in mid-1965.', u'Thieu gradually outmaneuvered Ky and cemented his grip on power in fraudulent elections in 1967 and 1971.', u'Under this political instability, the communists began to gain ground.', u"To support South Vietnam's struggle against the communist insurgency, the United States began increasing its contribution of military advisers, using the 1964 Tonkin Gulf incident as a pretext for such intervention.", u'US forces became involved in ground combat operations in 1965, and at their peak they numbered more than 500,000.', u'The US also engaged in a sustained aerial bombing campaign.', u'Meanwhile, China and the Soviet Union provided North Vietnam with significant material aid and 15,000 combat advisers.', u'Communist forces supplying the Viet Cong carried supplies along the Ho Chi Minh trail, which passed through Laos.', u'The communists attacked South Vietnamese targets during the 1968 Tet Offensive.', u'Although the campaign failed militarily, it shocked the American establishment, and turned US public opinion against the war.', u'During the offensive, communist troops massacred over 3,000 civilians at Hue.', u'Facing an increasing casualty count, rising domestic opposition to the war, and growing international condemnation, the US began withdrawing from ground combat roles in the early 1970s.', u'This process also entailed an unsuccessful effort to strengthen and stabilize South Vietnam.', u'Following the Paris Peace Accords of 27 January 1973, all American combat troops were withdrawn by 29 March 1973.', u'In December 1974, North Vietnam captured the province of Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Long and started a full-scale offensive, culminating in the Fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975.', u'South Vietnam was briefly ruled by a provisional government while under military occupation by North Vietnam.', u'On 2 July 1976, North and South Vietnam were merged to form the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.', u'The war left Vietnam devastated, with the total death toll standing at between 800,000 and 3.1 million.', u"=== 1976\u2013present: reunification and reforms ===\n\nIn the aftermath of the war, under L\xea Du\u1ea9n's administration, there were no mass executions of South Vietnamese who had collaborated with the U.S. or the Saigon government, confounding Western fears.", u'However, up to 300,000 South Vietnamese were sent to reeducation camps, where many endured torture, starvation, and disease while being forced to perform hard labor.', u'The government embarked on a mass campaign of collectivization of farms and factories.', u'This caused economic chaos and resulted in triple-digit inflation, while national reconstruction efforts progressed slowly.', u'In 1978, the Vietnamese military invaded Cambodia to remove from power the Khmer Rouge, who had been attacking Vietnamese border villages.', u'Vietnam was victorious, installing a government in Cambodia which ruled until 1989.', u'This action worsened relations with the Chinese, who launched a brief incursion into northern Vietnam in 1979.', u'This conflict caused Vietnam to rely even more heavily on Soviet economic and military aid.', u'At the Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam in December 1986, reformist politicians replaced the "old guard" government with new leadership.', u"The reformers were led by 71-year-old Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Linh, who became the party's new general secretary.", u'Linh and the reformers implemented a series of free-market reforms \u2013 known as \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi ("Renovation") \u2013 which carefully managed the transition from a planned economy to a "socialist-oriented market economy".', u'Though the authority of the state remained unchallenged under \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi, the government encouraged private ownership of farms and factories, economic deregulation and foreign investment, while maintaining control over strategic industries.', u'The Vietnamese economy subsequently achieved strong growth in agricultural and industrial production, construction, exports and foreign investment.', u'However, these reforms have also caused a rise in income inequality and gender disparities.', u"== Government and politics ==\n\nThe Socialist Republic of Vietnam, along with China, Cuba, and Laos, is one of the world's four remaining one-party socialist states officially espousing communism.", u'Its current state constitution, 2013 Constitution, asserts the central role of the Communist Party of Vietnam in all organs of government, politics and society.', u"The General Secretary of the Communist Party performs numerous key administrative and executive functions, controlling the party's national organization and state appointments, as well as setting policy.", u'Only political organizations affiliated with or endorsed by the Communist Party are permitted to contest elections in Vietnam.', u'These include the Vietnamese Fatherland Front and worker and trade unionist parties.', u'Although the state remains officially committed to socialism as its defining creed, its economic policies have grown increasingly capitalist, with The Economist characterizing its leadership as "ardently capitalist communists".', u'=== Legislature ===\nThe National Assembly of Vietnam is the unicameral legislature of the state, composed of 498 members.', u'Headed by a Chairman, it is superior to both the executive and judicial branches, with all government ministers being appointed from members of the National Assembly.', u'=== Executive ===\n\nThe President of Vietnam is the titular head of state and the nominal commander-in-chief of the military, serving as the Chairman of the Council of Supreme Defense and Security.', u'The Prime Minister of Vietnam is the head of government, presiding over a council of ministers composed of three deputy prime ministers and the heads of 26 ministries and commissions.', u"=== Judiciary ===\nThe Supreme People's Court of Vietnam, headed by a Chief Justice, is the country's highest court of appeal, though it is also answerable to the National Assembly.", u"Beneath the Supreme People's Court stand the provincial municipal courts and numerous local courts.", u'Military courts possess special jurisdiction in matters of national security.', u'Vietnam maintains the death penalty for numerous offences; as of February 2014, there are around 700 inmates on death row in Vietnam.', u"=== Military ===\n\nThe Vietnam People's Armed Forces consists of the Vietnam People's Army, the Vietnam People's Public Security and the Vietnam Civil Defense Force.", u"The Vietnam People's Army (VPA) is the official name for the active military services of Vietnam, and is subdivided into the Vietnam People's Ground Forces, the Vietnam People's Navy, the Vietnam People's Air Force, the Vietnam Border Defense Force and the Vietnam Coast Guard.", u'The VPA has an active manpower of around 450,000, but its total strength, including paramilitary forces, may be as high as 5,000,000.', u"In 2011, Vietnam's military expenditure totalled approximately US$2.48 billion, equivalent to around 2.5% of its 2010 GDP.", u"=== International relations ===\n\nThroughout its history, Vietnam's key foreign relationship has been with its largest neighbour and one-time imperial master, China.", u"Vietnam's sovereign principles and insistence on cultural independence have been laid down in numerous documents over the centuries, such as the 11th-century patriotic poem Nam qu\u1ed1c s\u01a1n h\xe0 and the 1428 proclamation of independence B\xecnh Ng\xf4 \u0111\u1ea1i c\xe1o.", u'Though China and Vietnam are now formally at peace, significant territorial tensions remain between the two countries.', u'Currently, the formal mission statement of Vietnamese foreign policy is to: "Implement consistently the foreign policy line of independence, self-reliance, peace, cooperation and development; the foreign policy of openness and diversification and multi-lateralization of international relations.', u'Proactively and actively engage in international economic integration while expanding international cooperation in other fields."', u'Vietnam furthermore declares itself to be "a friend and reliable partner of all countries in the international community, actively taking part in international and regional cooperation processes."', u'By December 2007, Vietnam had established diplomatic relations with 172 countries, including the United States, which normalized relations in 1995.', u'Vietnam holds membership of 63 international organizations, including the United Nations, ASEAN, NAM, Francophonie and WTO.', u'It also maintains relations with over 650 non-government organizations.', u'In May 2016, President Obama further normalized relations with Vietnam after he announced the lifting of an arms embargo on sales of lethal arms to Vietnam.', u'=== Administrative subdivisions ===\n\nVietnam is divided into 58 provinces (Vietnamese: t\u1ec9nh, from the Chinese \u7701, sh\u011bng).', u'There are also five municipalities (th\xe0nh ph\u1ed1 tr\u1ef1c thu\u1ed9c trung \u01b0\u01a1ng), which are administratively on the same level as provinces.', u'The provinces are subdivided into provincial municipalities (th\xe0nh ph\u1ed1 tr\u1ef1c thu\u1ed9c t\u1ec9nh), townships (th\u1ecb x\xe3) and counties (huy\u1ec7n), which are in turn subdivided into towns (th\u1ecb tr\u1ea5n) or communes (x\xe3).', u'The centrally controlled municipalities are subdivided into districts (qu\u1eadn) and counties, which are further subdivided into wards (ph\u01b0\u1eddng).', u'== Geography ==\n\nVietnam is located on the eastern Indochina Peninsula between the latitudes 8\xb0 and 24\xb0N, and the longitudes 102\xb0 and 110\xb0E.', u'It covers a total area of approximately 331,210 km2 (127,881 sq mi), making it almost the size of Germany.', u"The combined length of the country's land boundaries is 4,639 km (2,883 mi), and its coastline is 3,444 km (2,140 mi) long.", u'At its narrowest point in the central Qu\u1ea3ng B\xecnh Province, the country is as little as 50 kilometres (31 mi) across, though it widens to around 600 kilometres (370 mi) in the north.', u"Vietnam's land is mostly hilly and densely forested, with level land covering no more than 20%.", u"Mountains account for 40% of the country's land area, and tropical forests cover around 42%.", u'The northern part of the country consists mostly of highlands and the Red River Delta.', u'Phan Xi P\u0103ng, located in L\xe0o Cai Province, is the highest mountain in Vietnam, standing 3,143 m (10,312 ft) high.', u'Southern Vietnam is divided into coastal lowlands, the mountains of the Annamite Range, and extensive forests.', u"Comprising five relatively flat plateaus of basalt soil, the highlands account for 16% of the country's arable land and 22% of its total forested land.", u'The soil in much of southern Vietnam is relatively poor in nutrients.', u'The Red River Delta, a flat, roughly triangular region covering 15,000 km2 (5,792 sq mi), is smaller but more intensely developed and more densely populated than the Mekong River Delta.', u'Once an inlet of the Gulf of Tonkin, it has been filled in over the millennia by riverine alluvial deposits.', u'The delta, covering about 40,000 km2 (15,444 sq mi), is a low-level plain no more than 3 meters (9.8 ft) above sea level at any point.', u'It is criss-crossed by a maze of rivers and canals, which carry so much sediment that the delta advances 60 to 80 meters (196.9 to 262.5 ft) into the sea every year.', u'=== Panoramic view ===\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nBecause of differences in latitude and the marked variety in topographical relief, the climate tends to vary considerably from place to place.', u'During the winter or dry season, extending roughly from November to April, the monsoon winds usually blow from the northeast along the Chinese coast and across the Gulf of Tonkin, picking up considerable moisture.', u'Consequently, the winter season in most parts of the country is dry only by comparison with the rainy or summer season.', u'The average annual temperature is generally higher in the plains than in the mountains, and higher in the south than in the north.', u'Temperatures vary less in the southern plains around Ho Chi Minh City and the Mekong Delta, ranging between 21 and 28 \xb0C (69.8 and 82.4 \xb0F) over the course of the year.', u'Seasonal variations in the mountains and plateaus and in the north are much more dramatic, with temperatures varying from 5 \xb0C (41.0 \xb0F) in December and January to 37 \xb0C (98.6 \xb0F) in July and August.', u'=== Ecology and biodiversity ===\n\nVietnam has two World Natural Heritage Sites \u2013 H\u1ea1 Long Bay and Phong Nha-K\u1ebb B\xe0ng National Park \u2013 and six biosphere reserves, including C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd Mangrove Forest, C\xe1t Ti\xean, C\xe1t B\xe0, Ki\xean Giang, the Red River Delta, and Western Ngh\u1ec7 An.', u'Vietnam lies in the Indomalaya ecozone.', u'According to the 2005 National Environmental Present Condition Report.', u'Vietnam is one of twenty-five countries considered to possess a uniquely high level of biodiversity.', u"It is ranked 16th worldwide in biological diversity, being home to approximately 16% of the world's species.", u"15,986 species of flora have been identified in the country, of which 10% are endemic, while Vietnam's fauna include 307 nematode species, 200 oligochaeta, 145 acarina, 113 springtails, 7,750 insects, 260 reptiles, 120 amphibians, 840 birds and 310 mammals, of which 100 birds and 78 mammals are endemic.", u'Vietnam is furthermore home to 1,438 species of freshwater microalgae, constituting 9.6% of all microalgae species, as well as 794 aquatic invertebrates and 2,458 species of sea fish.', u'In recent years, 13 genera, 222 species, and 30 taxa of flora have been newly described in Vietnam.', u"Six new mammal species, including the saola, giant muntjac and Tonkin snub-nosed monkey have also been discovered, along with one new bird species, the endangered Edwards's pheasant.", u'In the late 1980s, a small population of Javan rhinoceros was found in C\xe1t Ti\xean National Park.', u'However, the last individual of the species in Vietnam was reportedly shot in 2010.', u"In agricultural genetic diversity, Vietnam is one of the world's twelve original cultivar centers.", u'The Vietnam National Cultivar Gene Bank preserves 12,300 cultivars of 115 species.', u'The Vietnamese government spent US$49.07 million on the preservation of biodiversity in 2004 alone, and has established 126 conservation areas, including 28 national parks.', u"== Economy ==\n\nIn 2012, Vietnam's nominal GDP reached US$138 billion, with a nominal GDP per capita of $1,527.", u"According to a December 2005 forecast by Goldman Sachs, the Vietnamese economy will become the world's 21st-largest by 2025, with an estimated nominal GDP of $436 billion and a nominal GDP per capita of $4,357.", u"According to a 2008 forecast by PricewaterhouseCoopers, Vietnam may be the fastest-growing of the world's emerging economies by 2025, with a potential growth rate of almost 10% per annum in real dollar terms.", u"In 2012, HSBC predicted that Vietnam's total GDP would surpass those of Norway, Singapore and Portugal by 2050.", u'Vietnam has been for much of its history a predominantly agricultural civilization based on wet rice cultivation.', u'There is also an industry for bauxite mining in Vietnam, an important material for the production of aluminum.', u'The Vietnamese economy is shaped primarily by the Vietnamese Communist Party in Five Year Plans made through the plenary sessions of the Central Committee and national congresses.', u'The collectivization of farms, factories and economic capital is a part of this central planning, with millions of people working in government programs.', u"Vietnam's economy has been plagued with inefficiency and corruption in state programs, poor quality and underproduction, and restrictions on economic activity.", u'It also suffered from the post-war trade embargo instituted by the United States and most of Europe.', u"These problems were compounded by the erosion of the Soviet bloc, which included Vietnam's main trading partners, in the late 1980s.", u'In 1986, the Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party introduced socialist-oriented market economic reforms as part of the \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi reform program.', u'Private ownership was encouraged in industries, commerce and agriculture.', u"Thanks largely to these reforms, Vietnam achieved around 8% annual GDP growth between 1990 and 1997, and the economy continued to grow at an annual rate of around 7% from 2000 to 2005, making Vietnam one of the world's fastest growing economies.", u"Growth remained strong even in the face of the late-2000s global recession, holding at 6.8% in 2010, but Vietnam's year-on-year inflation rate hit 11.8% in December 2010, according to a GSO estimate.", u'The Vietnamese dong was devalued three times in 2010 alone.', u'Manufacturing, information technology and high-tech industries now form a large and fast-growing part of the national economy.', u'Though Vietnam is a relative newcomer to the oil industry, it is currently the third-largest oil producer in Southeast Asia, with a total 2011 output of 318,000 barrels per day (50,600 m3/d).', u'In 2010, Vietnam was ranked as the 8th largest crude petroleum producers in the Asia and Pacific region.', u'Like its Chinese neighbours, Vietnam continues to make use of centrally planned economic five-year plans.', u'Deep poverty, defined as the percentage of the population living on less than $1 per day, has declined significantly in Vietnam, and the relative poverty rate is now less than that of China, India, and the Philippines.', u'This decline in the poverty rate can be attributed to equitable economic policies aimed at improving living standards and preventing the rise of inequality; these policies have included egalitarian land distribution during the initial stages of the \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi program, investment in poorer remote areas, and subsidising of education and healthcare.', u'According to the IMF, the unemployment rate in Vietnam stood at 4.46% in 2012.', u'=== Trade ===\n\nSince the early 2000s, Vietnam has applied sequenced trade liberalisation, a two-track approach opening some sectors of the economy to international markets while protecting others.', u'In July 2006, Vietnam updated its intellectual property legislation to comply with TRIPS, and it became a member of the WTO on 11 January 2007.', u"Vietnam is now one of Asia's most open economies: two-way trade was valued at around 160% of GDP in 2006, more than twice the contemporary ratio for China and over four times the ratio for India.", u"Vietnam's chief trading partners include China, Japan, Australia, the ASEAN countries, the United States and Western Europe.", u"Vietnam's Customs office reported in July 2013 that the total value of international merchandise trade for the first half of 2013 was US$124 billion, which was 15.7% higher than the same period in 2012.", u'Mobile phones and their parts were both imported and exported in large numbers, while in the natural resources market, crude oil was a top-ranking export and high levels of iron and steel were imported during this period.', u"The U.S. was the country that purchased the highest amount of Vietnam's exports, while Chinese goods were the most popular Vietnamese import.", u'As a result of several land reform measures, Vietnam has become a major exporter of agricultural products.', u"It is now the world's largest producer of cashew nuts, with a one-third global share; the largest producer of black pepper, accounting for one-third of the world's market; and the second-largest rice exporter in the world, after Thailand.", u"Vietnam is the world's second largest exporter of coffee.", u'Vietnam has the highest proportion of land use for permanent crops \u2013 6.93% \u2013 of any nation in the Greater Mekong Subregion.', u'Other primary exports include tea, rubber, and fishery products.', u"However, agriculture's share of Vietnam's GDP has fallen in recent decades, declining from 42% in 1989 to 20% in 2006, as production in other sectors of the economy has risen.", u"In 2014 Vietnam negotiated a free trade agreement with the European Union, giving the country access to the EU's Generalized System of Preferences.", u'This provides preferential access to European markets for developing countries through reduced tariffs.', u'=== Science and technology ===\n\nVietnamese scholars developed many academic fields during the dynastic era, most notably social sciences and the humanities.', u'Vietnam has a millennium-deep legacy of analytical histories, such as the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t s\u1eed k\xfd to\xe0n th\u01b0 of Ng\xf4 S\u0129 Li\xean.', u'Vietnamese monks led by the abdicated Emperor Tr\u1ea7n Nh\xe2n T\xf4ng developed the Tr\xfac L\xe2m Zen branch of philosophy in the 13th century.', u'Arithmetics and geometry have been widely taught in Vietnam since the 15th century, using the textbook \u0110\u1ea1i th\xe0nh to\xe1n ph\xe1p by L\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ebf Vinh as a basis.', u'L\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ebf Vinh introduced Vietnam to the notion of zero, while M\u1ea1c Hi\u1ec3n T\xedch used the term s\u1ed1 \u1ea9n (en: "unknown/secret/hidden number") to refer to negative numbers.', u"Vietnamese scholars furthermore produced numerous encyclopedias, such as L\xea Qu\xfd \u0110\xf4n's V\xe2n \u0111\xe0i lo\u1ea1i ng\u1eef.", u'In recent times, Vietnamese scientists have made many significant contributions in various fields of study, most notably in mathematics.', u'Ho\xe0ng T\u1ee5y pioneered the applied mathematics field of global optimization in the 20th century, while Ng\xf4 B\u1ea3o Ch\xe2u won the 2010 Fields Medal for his proof of fundamental lemma in the theory of automorphic forms.', u'Vietnam is currently working to develop an indigenous space program, and plans to construct the US$600 million Vietnam Space Center by 2018.', u'Vietnam has also made significant advances in the development of robots, such as the TOPIO humanoid model.', u"In 2010, Vietnam's total state spending on science and technology equalled around 0.45% of its GDP.", u"=== Transport ===\n\nMuch of Vietnam's modern transport network was originally developed under French rule to facilitate the transportation of raw materials, and was reconstructed and extensively modernized following the Vietnam War.", u'==== Air ====\n\nVietnam operates 21 major civil airports, including three international gateways: Noi Bai in Hanoi, Da Nang International Airport in Da Nang, and Tan Son Nhat in Ho Chi Minh City.', u"Tan Son Nhat is the nation's largest airport, handling 75% of international passenger traffic.", u'According to a state-approved plan, Vietnam will have 10 international airports by 2015 \u2013 besides the aforementioned three, these include Vinh International Airport, Phu Bai International Airport, Cam Ranh International Airport, Phu Quoc International Airport, Cat Bi International Airport, C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 International Airport and Long Thanh International Airport.', u'The planned Long Thanh International Airport will have an annual service capacity of 100 million passengers once it becomes fully operational in 2020.', u'Vietnam Airlines, the state-owned national airline, maintains a fleet of 69 passenger aircraft, and aims to operate 150 by 2020.', u'Several private airlines are also in operation in Vietnam, including Air Mekong, Jetstar Pacific Airlines, VASCO and VietJet Air.', u"==== Road ====\n\nVietnam's road system includes national roads administered at the central level, provincial roads managed at the provincial level, district roads managed at the district level, urban roads managed by cities and towns, and commune roads managed at the commune level.", u"Bicycles, motor scooters and motorcycles remain the most popular forms of road transport in Vietnam's urban areas, although the number of privately owned automobiles is also on the rise, especially in the larger cities.", u'Public buses operated by private companies are the main mode of long-distance travel for much of the population.', u'Road safety is a serious issue in Vietnam \u2013 on average, 30 people are killed in traffic accidents every day.', u"Traffic congestion is a growing problem in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, as the cities' roads struggle to cope with the boom in automobile use.", u"==== Rail ====\n\nVietnam's primary cross-country rail service is the Reunification Express, which runs from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi, covering a distance of nearly 2,000 kilometres.", u'From Hanoi, railway lines branch out to the northeast, north and west; the eastbound line runs from Hanoi to H\u1ea1 Long Bay, the northbound line from Hanoi to Th\xe1i Nguy\xean, and the northeast line from Hanoi to L\xe0o Cai.', u'In 2009, Vietnam and Japan signed a deal to build a high-speed railway using Japanese technology; numerous Vietnamese engineers were later sent to Japan to receive training in the operation and maintenance of high-speed trains.', u'The railway will be a 1,630-km-long express route, serving a total of 26 stations, including Hanoi and the Thu Thiem terminus in Ho Chi Minh City.', u"Using Japan's Shinkansen technology, the line will support trains travelling at a maximum speed of 360 kilometres (220 mi) per hour.", u'The high-speed lines linking Hanoi to Vinh, Nha Trang and Ho Chi Minh City will be laid by 2015.', u'From 2015 to 2020, construction will begin on the routes between Vinh and Nha Trang and between Hanoi and the northern provinces of L\xe0o Cai and L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n.', u'==== Water ====\nAs a coastal country, Vietnam has many major sea ports, including Cam Ranh, Da Nang, Hai Phong, Ho Chi Minh City, Hong Gai, Qui Nh\u01a1n, V\u0169ng T\xe0u and Nha Trang.', u"Further inland, the country's extensive network of rivers play a key role in rural transportation, with over 17,700 kilometres (11,000 mi) of navigable waterways carrying ferries, barges and water taxis.", u"In addition, the Mekong Delta and Red River Delta are vital to Vietnam's social and economic welfare \u2013 most of the country's population lives along or near these river deltas, and the major cities of Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi are situated near the Mekong and Red River deltas, respectively.", u'Further out in the South China Sea, Vietnam currently controls the majority of the disputed Spratly Islands, which are the source of longstanding disagreements with China and other nearby nations.', u'=== Water supply and sanitation ===\n\nWater supply and sanitation in Vietnam is characterized by challenges and achievements.', u'Among the achievements is a substantial increase in access to water supply and sanitation between 1990 and 2010, nearly universal metering, and increased investment in wastewater treatment since 2007.', u'Among the challenges are continued widespread water pollution, poor service quality, low access to improved sanitation in rural areas, poor sustainability of rural water systems, insufficient cost recovery for urban sanitation, and the declining availability of foreign grant and soft loan funding as the Vietnamese economy grows and donors shift to loan financing.', u'The government also promotes increased cost recovery through tariff revenues and has created autonomous water utilities at the provincial level, but the policy has had mixed success as tariff levels remain low and some utilities have engaged in activities outside their mandate.', u'== Demographics ==\n\nAs of 2014, the population of Vietnam as standing at approximately 90.7 million people.', u'The population had grown significantly from the 1979 census, which showed the total population of reunified Vietnam to be 52.7 million.', u"In 2012, the country's population was estimated at approximately 90.3 million.", u"Currently, the total fertility rate of Vietnam is 1.8 (births per woman), which is largely due to the government's family planning policy, the two-child policy.", u'=== Ethnicity ===\n\nAccording to the 2009 census, the dominant Viet or Kinh ethnic group constituted nearly 73.6 million people, or 85.8% of the population.', u'The Kinh population is concentrated mainly in the alluvial deltas and coastal plains of the country.', u'A largely homogeneous social and ethnic group, the Kinh possess significant political and economic influence over the country.', u'However, Vietnam is also home to 54 ethnic minority groups, including the Hmong, Dao, Tay, Thai, and N\xf9ng.', u"Many ethnic minorities \u2013 such as the Muong, who are closely related to the Kinh \u2013 dwell in the highlands, which cover two-thirds of Vietnam's territory.", u"Before the Vietnam War, the population of the Central Highlands was almost exclusively Degar (including over 40 tribal groups); however, Ng\xf4 \u0110\xecnh Di\u1ec7m's South Vietnamese government enacted a program of resettling Kinh in indigenous areas.", u'The Hoa (ethnic Chinese) and Khmer Krom people are mainly lowlanders.', u'As Sino-Vietnamese relations soured in 1978 and 1979, some 450,000 Hoa left Vietnam.', u'=== Languages ===\n\nThe official national language of Vietnam is Vietnamese (Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t), a tonal Mon\u2013Khmer language which is spoken by the majority of the population.', u'In its early history, Vietnamese writing used Chinese characters.', u'In the 13th century, the Vietnamese developed their own set of characters, referred to as Ch\u1eef n\xf4m.', u'The folk epic Truy\u1ec7n Ki\u1ec1u ("The Tale of Kieu", originally known as \u0110o\u1ea1n tr\u01b0\u1eddng t\xe2n thanh ) by Nguy\u1ec5n Du was written in Ch\u1eef n\xf4m.', u'Qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef, the romanized Vietnamese alphabet used for spoken Vietnamese, was developed in the 17th century by the Jesuit Alexandre de Rhodes and several other Catholic missionaries.', u'Qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef became widely popular and brought literacy to the Vietnamese masses during the French colonial period.', u"Vietnam's minority groups speak a variety of languages, including T\xe0y, M\u01b0\u1eddng, Cham, Khmer, Chinese, N\xf9ng, and H'M\xf4ng.", u'The Montagnard peoples of the Central Highlands also speak a number of distinct languages.', u'A number of sign languages have developed in the cities.', u'The French language, a legacy of colonial rule, is spoken by many educated Vietnamese as a second language, especially among the older generation and those educated in the former South Vietnam, where it was a principal language in administration, education and commerce; Vietnam remains a full member of the Francophonie, and education has revived some interest in the language.', u'Russian \u2013 and to a much lesser extent German, Czech and Polish \u2013 are known among some Vietnamese whose families had ties with the Soviet bloc during the Cold War.', u"In recent years, as Vietnam's contacts with Western nations have increased, English has become more popular as a second language.", u'The study of English is now obligatory in most schools, either alongside or in many cases, replacing French.', u"Japanese and Korean have also grown in popularity as Vietnam's links with other East Asian nations have strengthened.", u"=== Religion ===\n\nAccording to an analysis by the Pew Research Center, in 2010 about 45.3% of the Vietnamese adhere to indigenous religions, 16.4% to Buddhism, 8.2% to Christianity, 0.4% to other faiths, and 29.6% of the population isn't religious.", u"According to the General Statistics Office of Vietnam's report for 1 April 2009, 6.8 million (or 7.9% of the total population) are practicing Buddhists, 5.7 million (6.6%) are Catholics, 1.4 million (1.7%) are adherents of H\xf2a H\u1ea3o, 0.8 million (0.9%) practise Caodaism, and 0.7 million (0.9%) are Protestants.", u'In total, 15,651,467 Vietnamese (18.2%) are formally registered in a religion.', u'According to the 2009 census, while over 10 million people have taken refuge in the Three Jewels of Buddhism, the vast majority of Vietnamese people practice ancestor worship in some form.', u'According to a 2007 report, 81% of the Vietnamese people do not believe in God.', u'About 8% of the population are Christians, totalling around six million Roman Catholics and fewer than one million Protestants.', u'Christianity was first introduced to Vietnam by Portuguese and Dutch traders in the 16th and 17th centuries, and was further propagated by French missionaries in the 19th and 20th centuries, and to a lesser extent, by American Protestant missionaries during the Vietnam War, largely among the Montagnards of South Vietnam.', u'The largest Protestant churches are the Evangelical Church of Vietnam and the Montagnard Evangelical Church.', u"Two-thirds of Vietnam's Protestants are reportedly members of ethnic minorities.", u"Although a small religious minority, Protestantism is claimed to be the country's fastest-growing religion, expanding at a rate of 600% in the previous decade.", u'The Vietnamese government is widely seen as suspicious of Roman Catholicism.', u'This mistrust originated during the 19th century, when some Catholics collaborated with the French colonists in conquering and ruling the country and in helping French attempts to install Catholic emperors, such as in the L\xea V\u0103n Kh\xf4i revolt of 1833.', u"Furthermore, the Catholic Church's strongly anti-communist stance has made it an enemy of the Vietnamese state.", u'The Vatican Church is officially banned, and only government-controlled Catholic organisations are permitted.', u'However, the Vatican has attempted to negotiate the opening of diplomatic relations with Vietnam in recent years.', u'Several other minority faiths exist in Vietnam.', u'A significant number of people are adherents of Caodaism, an indigenous folk religion which has structured itself on the model of the Catholic Church.', u'Sunni and Cham Bani Islam is primarily practiced by the ethnic Cham minority, though there are also a few ethnic Vietnamese adherents in the southwest.', u"In total, there are approximately 70,000 Muslims in Vietnam, while around 50,000 Hindus and a small number of Baha'is are also in evidence.", u'The Vietnamese government rejects allegations that it does not allow religious freedom.', u"The state's official position on religion is that all citizens are free to their belief, and that all religions are equal before the law.", u'Nevertheless, only government-approved religious organisations are allowed; for example, the South Vietnam-founded Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam is banned in favour of a communist-approved body.', u'=== Education ===\n\nVietnam has an extensive state-controlled network of schools, colleges and universities, and a growing number of privately run and partially privatised institutions.', u'General education in Vietnam is divided into five categories: kindergarten, elementary schools, middle schools, high schools, and universities.', u'A large number of public schools have been constructed across the country to raise the national literacy rate, which stood at 90.3% in 2008.', u"A large number of Vietnam's most acclaimed universities are based in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.", u"Facing serious crises, Vietnam's education system is under a holistic program of reform launched by the government.", u'Education is not free; therefore, some poor families may have trouble paying tuition for their children without some form of public or private assistance.', u'Regardless, school enrollment is among the highest in the world, and the number of colleges and universities increased dramatically in the 2000s, from 178 in 2000 to 299 in 2005.', u"=== Health ===\n\nIn 2009, Vietnam's national life expectancy stood at 76 years for women and 72 for men, and the infant mortality rate was 12 per 1,000 live births.", u'By 2009, 85% of the population had access to improved water sources.', u'However, malnutrition is still common in the rural provinces.', u"In 2001, government spending on health care corresponded to just 0.9% of Vietnam's gross domestic product (GDP), with state subsidies covering only about 20% of health care expenses.", u'In 1954, North Vietnam established a public health system that reached down to the hamlet level.', u'After the national reunification in 1975, a nationwide health service was established.', u'In the late 1980s, the quality of healthcare declined to some degree as a result of budgetary constraints, a shift of responsibility to the provinces, and the introduction of charges.', u'Inadequate funding has also contributed to a shortage of nurses, midwives, and hospital beds; in 2000, Vietnam had only 250,000 hospital beds, or 14.8 beds per 10,000 people, according to the World Bank.', u'Since the early 2000s, Vietnam has made significant progress in combating malaria, with the malaria mortality rate falling to about 5% of its 1990s equivalent by 2005, after the country introduced improved antimalarial drugs and treatment.', u'However, tuberculosis cases are on the rise, with 57 deaths per day reported in May 2004.', u'With an intensified vaccination program, better hygiene, and foreign assistance, Vietnam hopes to reduce sharply the number of TB cases and annual new TB infections.', u'As of September 2005, Vietnam had diagnosed 101,291 HIV cases, of which 16,528 progressed to AIDS, and 9,554 died.', u'However, the actual number of HIV-positive individuals is estimated to be much higher.', u'On average, 40\u201350 new infections are reported every day in Vietnam.', u'As of 2007, 0.5% of the population is estimated to be infected with HIV, and this figure has remained stable since 2005.', u'In June 2004, the United States announced that Vietnam would be one of 15 nations to receive funding as part of a US$15 billion global AIDS relief plan.', u"== Culture ==\n\nVietnam's culture has developed over the centuries from indigenous ancient \u0110\xf4ng S\u01a1n culture with wet rice agriculture as its economic base.", u'Some elements of the national culture have Chinese origins, drawing on elements of Confucianism and Taoism in its traditional political system and philosophy.', u'Vietnamese society is structured around l\xe0ng (ancestral villages); all Vietnamese mark a common ancestral anniversary on the tenth day of the third lunar month.', u'The influences of immigrant peoples \u2013 such as the Cantonese, Hakka, Hokkien and Hainan cultures \u2013 can also be seen, while the national religion of Buddhism is strongly entwined with popular culture.', u'In recent centuries, the influences of Western cultures, most notably France and the United States, have become evident in Vietnam.', u'The traditional focuses of Vietnamese culture are humanity (nh\xe2n ngh\u0129a) and harmony (h\xf2a); family and community values are highly regarded.', u"Vietnam reveres a number of key cultural symbols, such as the Vietnamese dragon, which is derived from crocodile and snake imagery; Vietnam's National Father, L\u1ea1c Long Qu\xe2n, is depicted as a holy dragon.", u"The l\u1ea1c \u2013 a holy bird representing Vietnam's National Mother, \xc2u C\u01a1 \u2013 is another prominent symbol, while turtle and horse images are also revered.", u'In the modern era, the cultural life of Vietnam has been deeply influenced by government-controlled media and cultural programs.', u'For many decades, foreign cultural influences \u2013 especially those of Western origin \u2013 were shunned.', u'However, since the 1990s, Vietnam has seen a greater exposure to Southeast Asian, European and American culture and media.', u"=== Media ===\n\nVietnam's media sector is regulated by the government in accordance with the 2004 Law on Publication.", u"It is generally perceived that Vietnam's media sector is controlled by the government to follow the official Communist Party line, though some newspapers are relatively outspoken.", u'The Voice of Vietnam is the official state-run national radio broadcasting service, broadcasting internationally via shortwave using rented transmitters in other countries, and providing broadcasts from its website.', u'Vietnam Television is the national television broadcasting company.', u'Since 1997, Vietnam has extensively regulated public Internet access, using both legal and technical means.', u'The resulting lockdown is widely referred to as the "Bamboo Firewall".', u'The collaborative project OpenNet Initiative classifies Vietnam\'s level of online political censorship to be "pervasive", while Reporters Without Borders considers Vietnam to be one of 15 global "internet enemies".', u'Though the government of Vietnam claims to safeguard the country against obscene or sexually explicit content through its blocking efforts, many politically and religiously sensitive websites are also banned.', u"=== Music ===\n\nTraditional Vietnamese music varies between the country's northern and southern regions.", u"Northern classical music is Vietnam's oldest musical form, and is traditionally more formal.", u'The origins of Vietnamese classical music can be traced to the Mongol invasions of the 13th century, when the Vietnamese captured a Chinese opera troupe.', u'Throughout its history, Vietnamese has been most heavily impacted by the Chinese musical tradition, as an integral part, along with Korea, Mongolia and Japan.', u'Nh\xe3 nh\u1ea1c is the most popular form of imperial court music.', u'Ch\xe8o is a form of generally satirical musical theatre.', u'X\u1ea9m or H\xe1t x\u1ea9m (X\u1ea9m singing) is a type of Vietnamese folk music.', u'Quan h\u1ecd (alternate singing) is popular in H\xe0 B\u1eafc (divided into B\u1eafc Ninh and B\u1eafc Giang Provinces) and across Vietnam.', u'H\xe1t ch\u1ea7u v\u0103n or h\xe1t v\u0103n is a spiritual form of music used to invoke spirits during ceremonies.', u'Nh\u1ea1c d\xe2n t\u1ed9c c\u1ea3i bi\xean is a modern form of Vietnamese folk music which arose in the 1950s.', u'Ca tr\xf9 (also h\xe1t \u1ea3 \u0111\xe0o) is a popular folk music.', u'"H\xf2" can not be thought of as the southern style of Quan h\u1ecd.', u'There are a range of traditional instruments, including the \u0110\xe0n b\u1ea7u (a monochord zither), the \u0110\xe0n g\xe1o (a two-stringed fiddle with coconut body), and the \u0110\xe0n nguy\u1ec7t (a two-stringed fretted moon lute).', u'=== Literature ===\n\nVietnamese literature has a centuries-deep history.', u'The country has a rich tradition of folk literature, based on the typical 6\u2013to-8-verse poetic form named ca dao, which usually focuses on village ancestors and heroes.', u'Written literature has been found dating back to the 10th-century Ng\xf4 dynasty, with notable ancient authors including Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\xe3i, Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o, Nguy\u1ec5n Du and Nguy\u1ec5n \u0110\xecnh Chi\u1ec3u.', u'Some literary genres play an important role in theatrical performance, such as h\xe1t n\xf3i in ca tr\xf9.', u'Some poetic unions have also been formed in Vietnam, such as the Tao \u0110\xe0n.', u'Vietnamese literature has in recent times been influenced by Western styles, with the first literary transformation movement \u2013 Th\u01a1 M\u1edbi \u2013 emerging in 1932.', u'=== Festivals ===\n\nVietnam has a plethora of festivals based on the lunar calendar, the most important being the T\u1ebft New Year celebration.', u'Traditional Vietnamese weddings remain widely popular, and are often celebrated by expatriate Vietnamese in Western countries.', u'=== Tourism ===\n\nVietnam has become a major tourist destination since the 1990s, assisted by significant state and private investment, particularly in coastal regions.', u'About 3.77 million international tourists visited Vietnam in 2009 alone.', u'Popular tourist destinations include the former imperial capital of Hu\xe9, the World Heritage Sites of Phong Nha-K\u1ebb B\xe0ng National Park, H\u1ed9i An and M\u1ef9 S\u01a1n, coastal regions such as Nha Trang, the caves of H\u1ea1 Long Bay and the Marble Mountains.', u'Numerous tourist projects are under construction, such as the B\xecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng tourist complex, which possesses the largest artificial sea in Southeast Asia.', u"On 14 February 2011, Joe Jackson, the father of American pop star Michael Jackson, attended a ground breaking ceremony for what will be Southeast Asia's largest entertainment complex, a five-star hotel and amusement park called Happyland.", u'The US$2 billion project, which has been designed to accommodate 14 million tourists annually, is located in southern Long An Province, near Ho Chi Minh City.', u'It is expected that the complex will be completed in 2014.', u'=== Clothing ===\nThe \xe1o d\xe0i, a formal dress, is worn for special occasions such as weddings and religious festivals.', u'White \xe1o d\xe0i is the required uniform for girls in many high schools across Vietnam.', u'\xc1o d\xe0i was once worn by both genders, but today it is mostly the preserve of women, although men do wear it to some occasions, such as traditional weddings.', u'Other examples of traditional Vietnamese clothing include the \xe1o t\u1ee9 th\xe2n, a four-piece woman\'s dress; the \xe1o ng\u0169, a form of the th\xe2n in 5-piece form, mostly worn in the north of the country; the y\u1ebfm, a woman\'s undergarment; the \xe1o b\xe0 ba, rural working "pyjamas" for men and women; the \xe1o g\u1ea5m, a formal brocade tunic for government receptions;

and recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1979.', u'As of 2014, Vietnam has never participated in the Winter Olympics.', u'In 2016, Vietnam participated in the Rio Olympics, where they won their first gold medal.', u'=== Cuisine ===\n\nVietnamese cuisine traditionally features a combination of five fundamental taste "elements" (Vietnamese: ng\u0169 v\u1ecb): spicy (metal), sour (wood), bitter (fire), salty (water) and sweet (earth).', u'Common ingredients include fish sauce, shrimp paste, soy sauce, rice, fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables.', u"Vietnamese recipes use lemongrass, ginger, mint, Vietnamese mint, long coriander, Saigon cinnamon, bird's eye chili, lime and basil leaves.", u'Traditional Vietnamese cooking is known for its fresh ingredients, minimal use of oil, and reliance on herbs and vegetables, and is considered one of the healthiest cuisines worldwide.', u'In northern Vietnam, local foods are often less spicy than southern dishes, as the colder northern climate limits the production and availability of spices.', u'Black pepper is used in place of chilis to produce spicy flavors.', u'The use of such meats as pork, beef, and chicken was relatively limited in the past, and as a result freshwater fish, crustaceans \u2013 particularly crabs \u2013 and mollusks became widely used.', u'Fish sauce, soy sauce, prawn sauce, and limes are among the main flavoring ingredients.', u'Many signature Vietnamese dishes, such as b\xfan ri\xeau and b\xe1nh cu\u1ed1n, originated in the north and were carried to central and southern Vietnam by

{'sentences': [u'An electric light is a device that produces visible light by the flow of electric current.', u'It is the most common form of artificial lighting and is essential to modern society, providing interior lighting for buildings and exterior light for evening and nighttime activities.', u'In technical usage, a replaceable component that produces light from electricity is called a lamp.', u'Compact lamps are commonly called light bulbs; for example, the incandescent light bulb.', u'Lamps usually have a base made of ceramic, metal, glass or plastic, which secures the lamp in the socket of a light fixture.', u'The electrical connection to the socket may be made with a screw-thread base, two metal pins, two metal caps or a bayonet cap.', u'The three main categories of electric lights are incandescent lamps, which produce light by a filament heated white-hot by electric current, gas-discharge lamps, which produce light by means of an electric arc through a gas, and LED lamps, which produce light by a flow of electrons across a band gap in a semiconductor.', u'Before electric lighting became common in the early 20th century, people used candles, gas lights, oil lamps, and fires.', u'Humphry Davy developed the first incandescent light in 1802, followed by the first practical electric arc light in 1806.', u"By the 1870s, Davy's arc lamp had been successfully commercialized, and was used to light many public spaces.", u'The development of a steadily glowing filament suitable for interior lighting took longer, but by the early twentieth century inventors had successfully developed options, replacing the arc light with incandescents.', u'The energy efficiency of electric lighting has increased radically since the first demonstration of arc lamps and the incandescent light bulb of the 19th century.', u'Modern electric light sources come in a profusion of types and sizes adapted to myriad applications.', u'Most modern electric lighting is powered by centrally generated electric power, but lighting may also be powered by mobile or standby electric generators or battery systems.', u'Battery-powered light is often reserved for when and where stationary lights fail, often in the form of flashlights, electric lanterns, and in vehicles.', u'== Types ==\n\nTypes of electric lighting include:\nIncandescent light bulb, a heated filament inside a glass envelope\nHalogen lamps are incandescent lamps that use a fused quartz envelope filled with halogen gas\n\nLED lamp, a solid-state lamp that uses light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as the source of light\nArc lamp\nXenon arc lamp\nMercury-xenon arc lamp\nUltra-high-performance lamp, an ultra-high-pressure mercury-vapor arc lamp for use in projectors\nMetal-halide lamp\n\nGas-discharge lamp, a light source that generates light by sending an electrical discharge through an ionized gas\nFluorescent lamp\nCompact fluorescent lamp, a fluorescent lamp designed to replace an incandescent lamp\n\nNeon lamp\nMercury-vapor lamp\nSodium-vapor lamp\nSulfur lamp\nElectrodeless lamp, a gas discharge lamp in which the power is transferred from outside the bulb to inside via electromagnetic fields\n\nDifferent types of lights have vastly differing efficiencies and color of light.', u'*Color temperature is defined as the temperature of a black body emitting a similar spectrum; these spectra are quite different from those of black bodies.', u'The most efficient source of electric light is the low-pressure sodium lamp.', u'It produces, for all practical purposes, a monochromatic orange/yellow light, which gives a similarly monochromatic perceprtion of any illuminated scene.', u'For this reason, it is generally reserved for outdoor public lighting usages.', u'Low-pressure sodium lights are favoured for public lighting by astronomers, since the light pollution that they generate can be easily filtered, contrary to broadband or continuous spectra.', u'=== Incandescent light bulb ===\n\nThe modern incandescent light bulb, with a coiled filament of tungsten, was commercialized in the 1920s developed from the carbon filament lamp introduced in about 1880.', u'As well as bulbs for normal illumination, there is a very wide range, including low voltage, low-power types often used as components in equipment, but now largely displaced by LEDs\nThere is currently interest in banning some types of filament lamp in some countries, such as Australia planning to ban standard incandescent light bulbs by 2010, because they are inefficient at converting electricity to light.', u'Sri Lanka has already banned importing filament bulbs because of high use of electricity and less light.', u'Less than 3% of the input energy is converted into usable light.', u'Nearly all of the input energy ends up as heat that, in warm climates, must then be removed from the building by ventilation or air conditioning, often resulting in more energy consumption.', u'In colder climates where heating and lighting is required during the cold and dark winter months, the heat byproduct has at least some value.', u'==== Halogen lamp ====\n\nHalogen lamps are usually much smaller than standard incandescents, because for successful operation a bulb temperature over 200 \xb0C is generally necessary.', u'For this reason, most have a bulb of fused silica (quartz), but sometimes aluminosilicate glass.', u'This is often sealed inside an additional layer of glass.', u'The outer glass is a safety precaution, reducing UV emission and because halogen bulbs can occasionally explode during operation.', u'One reason is if the quartz bulb has oily residue from fingerprints.', u'The risk of burns or fire is also greater with bare bulbs, leading to their prohibition in some places unless enclosed by the luminaire.', u'Those designed for 12 or 24 volt operation have compact filaments, useful for good optical control, also they have higher efficiencies (lumens per watt) and better lives than non-halogen types.', u'The light output remains almost constant throughout life.', u'=== Fluorescent lamp ===\n\nFluorescent lamps consist of a glass tube that contains mercury vapour or argon under low pressure.', u'Electricity flowing through the tube causes the gases to give off ultraviolet energy.', u'The inside of the tubes are coated with phosphors that give off visible light when struck by ultraviolet energy.', u'have much higher efficiency than Incandescent lamps.', u'For the same amount of light generated, they typically use around one-quarter to one-third the power of an incandescent.', u'The typical luminous efficacy of fluorescent lighting systems is 50\u2013100 lumens per watt, several times the efficacy of incandescent bulbs with comparable light output.', u'Fluorescent lamp fixtures are more costly than incandescent lamps because they require a ballast to regulate the current through the lamp, but the lower energy cost typically offsets the higher initial cost.', u'Compact fluorescent lamps are now available in the same popular sizes as incandescents and are used as an energy-saving alternative in homes.', u'Because they contain mercury, many fluorescent lamps are classified as hazardous waste.', u'The United States Environmental Protection Agency recommends that fluorescent lamps be segregated from general waste for recycling or safe disposal, and some jurisdictions require recycling of them.', u'=== LED lamp ===\n\nSolid state LEDs have been popular as indicator lights in consumer electronics and professional audio gear since the 1970s.', u'In the 2000s efficacy and output have risen to the point where LEDs are now being used in lighting applications such as car headlights and brakelights, in flashlights and bike lights, as well as in decorative applications such as holiday lighting.', u'Indicator LEDs are known for their extremely long life, up to 100,000 hours, but lighting LEDs are operated much less conservatively, and consequently have shorter lives.', u'LED technology is useful for lighting designers because of its low power consumption, low heat generation, instantaneous on/off control, and in the case of single color LEDs, continuity of color throughout the life of the diode and relatively low cost of manufacture.', u'LED lifetime depends strongly on the temperature of the diode.', u"Operating an LED lamp in conditions that increase the internal temperature can greatly shorten the lamp's life.", u'=== Carbon arc lamp ===\n\nCarbon arc lamps consist of two carbon rod electrodes in open air, supplied by a current-limiting ballast.', u'The electric arc is struck by touching the rods then separating them.', u'The ensuing arc heats the carbon tips to white heat.', u'These lamps have higher efficiency than filament lamps, but the carbon rods are short lived and require constant adjustment in use.', u'The lamps produce significant ultra-violet output, they require ventilation when used indoors, and due to their intensity they need protecting from direct sight.', u'Invented by Humphry Davy around 1805, the carbon arc was the first practical electric light.', u'They were used commercially beginning in the 1870s for large building and street lighting until they were superseded in the early 20th century by the incandescent light.', u'Carbon arc lamps operate at high powers and produce high intensity white light.', u'They also are a point source of light.', u'They remained in use in limited applications that required these properties, such as movie projectors, stage lighting, and searchlights, until after World War 2.', u'=== Discharge lamp ===\nA discharge lamp has a glass or silica envelope containing two metal electrodes separated by a gas.', u'Gases used include, neon, argon, xenon, sodium, metal halide, and mercury.', u"The core operating principle is much the same as the carbon arc lamp, but the term 'arc lamp' is normally used to refer to carbon arc lamps, with more modern types of gas discharge lamp normally called discharge lamps.", u'With some discharge lamps, very high voltage is used to strike the arc.', u'This requires an electrical circuit called an igniter, which is part of the ballast circuitry.', u'After the arc is struck, the internal resistance of the lamp drops to a low level, and the ballast limits the current to the operating current.', u'Without a ballast, excess current would flow, causing rapid destruction of the lamp.', u'Some lamp types contain a little neon, which permits striking at normal running voltage, with no external ignition circuitry.', u'Low pressure sodium lamps operate this way.', u'The simplest ballasts are just an inductor, and are chosen where cost is the deciding factor, such as street lighting.', u'More advanced electronic ballasts may be designed to maintain constant light output over the life of the lamp, may drive the lamp with a square wave to maintain completely flicker-free output, and shut down in the event of certain faults.', u'== Lamp life expectancy ==\nLife expectancy for many types of lamp is defined as the number of hours of operation at which 50% of them fail, that is the median life of the lamps.', u'Production tolerances as low as 1% can create a variance of 25% in lamp life, so in general some lamps will fail well before the rated life expectancy, and some will last much longer.', u'For LEDs, lamp life is defined as the operation time at which 50% of lamps have experienced a 70% decrease in light output.', u'Some types of lamp are also sensitive to switching cycles.', u'Rooms with frequent switching such as bathrooms can expect much shorter lamp life than what is printed on the box.', u'Compact fluorescent lamps are particularly sensitive to switching cycles.', u'== Public lighting ==\nThe total amount of artificial light (especially from street light) is sufficient for cities to be easily visible at night from the air, and from space.', u'This light is the source of light pollution that burdens astronomers and others.', u"Human-made lights highlight particularly developed or populated areas of the Earth's surface, including the seaboards of Europe, the eastern United States, India, Japan and South Korea.", u'== Uses other than illumination ==\n\nElectric lamps can be used as heat sources, for example in incubators, as heat lamps in fast food restaurants and toys such as the Easy-Bake Oven.', u'Tungsten filament lamps have long been used as fast-acting thermistors in electronic circuits.', u'Popular uses have included:\nStabilisation of sine wave oscillators\nProtection of tweeters in speaker enclosures (excess current that is too high for the tweeter illuminates the light rather than blowing the tweeter).', u'Automatic volume control in telephones\n\n\n== Lamp circuit symbols ==\nIn circuit diagrams lamps usually are shown as symbols.', u'There are two main types of symbols, these are:\n\n\n== See also ==\nLightbulb socket\nLight source\nLight tube\nList of light sources\n\n\n== References =='], 'year': '1879-02-10', 'title': '1st electric arc light used [in California

1894, and in June 1895 Alois retired to Hafeld, near Lambach, where he farmed and kept bees.', u'Hitler attended Volksschule (a state-owned school) in nearby Fischlham.', u"The move to Hafeld coincided with the onset of intense father-son conflicts caused by Hitler's refusal to conform to the strict discipline of his school.", u"Alois Hitler's farming efforts at Hafeld ended in failure, and in 1897 the family moved to Lambach.", u'The eight-year-old Hitler took singing lessons, sang in the church choir, and even considered becoming a priest.', u'In 1898 the family returned permanently to Leonding.', u'The death of his younger brother Edmund, who died from measles in 1900, deeply affected Hitler.', u'He changed from a confident, outgoing, conscientious student to a morose, detached boy who constantly fought with his father and teachers.', u'Alois had made a successful career in the customs bureau and wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.', u'Hitler later dramatised an episode from this period when his father took him to visit a customs office, depicting it as an event that gave rise to an unforgiving antagonism between father and son, who were both strong-willed.', u"Ignoring his son's desire to attend a classical high school and become an artist, Alois sent Hitler to the Realschule in Linz in September 1900.", u'Hitler rebelled against this decision, and in Mein Kampf stated that he intentionally did poorly in school, hoping that once his father saw "what little progress I was making at the technical school he would let me devote myself to my dream".', u'Like many Austrian Germans, Hitler began to develop German nationalist ideas from a young age.', u'He expressed loyalty only to Germany, despising the declining Habsburg Monarchy and its rule over an ethnically variegated empire.', u'Hitler and his friends used the greeting "Heil", and sang the "Deutschlandlied" instead of the Austrian Imperial anthem.', u"After Alois's sudden death on 3 January 1903, Hitler's performance at school deteriorated and his mother allowed him to leave.", u'He enrolled at the Realschule in Steyr in September 1904, where his behaviour and performance improved.', u'In 1905, after passing a repeat of the final exam, Hitler left the school without any ambitions for further education or clear plans for a career.', u"=== Early adulthood in Vienna and Munich ===\n\nFrom 1905, Hitler lived a bohemian life in Vienna, financed by orphan's benefits and support from his mother.", u"He worked as a casual labourer and eventually as a painter, selling watercolours of Vienna's sights.", u'The Academy of Fine Arts Vienna rejected him in 1907 and again in 1908, citing "unfitness for painting".', u'The director recommended that Hitler study architecture, which was also an interest, but he lacked academic credentials as he had not finished secondary school.', u'On 21 December 1907, his mother died of breast cancer at the age of 47.', u"Hitler ran out of money and was forced to live in homeless shelters and men's hostels.", u'At the time Hitler lived there, Vienna was a hotbed of religious prejudice and racism.', u'Fears of being overrun by immigrants from the East were widespread, and the populist mayor Karl Lueger exploited the rhetoric of virulent anti-Semitism for political effect.', u'German nationalism had a widespread following in the Mariahilf district, where Hitler lived.', u'German nationalist Georg Ritter von Sch\xf6nerer, who advocated Pan-Germanism, anti-Semitism, anti-Slavism, and anti-Catholicism, was one influence on Hitler.', u'Hitler read local newspapers such as the Deutsches Volksblatt that fanned prejudice and played on Christian fears of being swamped by an influx of eastern Jews.', u'Hitler also read newspapers that published the main thoughts of philosophers and theoreticians such as Darwin, Nietzsche, Le Bon and Schopenhauer.', u'Hostile to what he saw as "Catholic Germanophobia", he developed an admiration for Martin Luther.', u"The origin and first expression of Hitler's anti-Semitism remain a matter of debate.", u'Hitler states in Mein Kampf that he first became an anti-Semite in Vienna.', u'His close friend, August Kubizek, claimed that Hitler was a "confirmed anti-Semite" before he left Linz.', u'Several sources provide strong evidence that Hitler had Jewish friends in his hostel and in other places in Vienna.', u'Historian Richard J. Evans states that "historians now generally agree that his notorious, murderous anti-Semitism emerged well after Germany\'s defeat [in World War I], as a product of the paranoid "stab-in-the-back" explanation for the catastrophe".', u"Hitler received the final part of his father's estate in May 1913 and moved to Munich.", u'Historians believe he left Vienna to evade conscription into the Austro-Hungarian Army.', u'Hitler later claimed that he did not wish to serve Austria-Hungary because of the mixture of races in its armed forces.', u'After he was deemed unfit for service\u2014he failed his physical exam in Salzburg on 5 February 1914\u2014he returned to Munich.', u'=== World War I ===\n\nIn 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, Hitler was living in Munich and voluntarily enlisted in the Bavarian Army.', u'According to a 1924 report by the Bavarian authorities, allowing Hitler to serve was almost certainly an administrative error, since as an Austrian citizen, he should have been returned to Austria.', u'Posted to the Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 16 (1st Company of the List Regiment), he served as a dispatch runner on the Western Front in France and Belgium, spending nearly half his time at the regimental headquarters in Fournes-en-Weppes, well behind the front lines.', u'He was present at the First Battle of Ypres, the Battle of the Somme, the Battle of Arras, and the Battle of Passchendaele, and was wounded at the Somme.', u'He was decorated for bravery, receiving the Iron Cross, Second Class, in 1914.', u"On a recommendation by Lieutenant Hugo Gutmann, Hitler's Jewish superior, he received the Iron Cross, First Class on 4 August 1918, a decoration rarely awarded to one of Hitler's Gefreiter rank.", u'He received the Black Wound Badge on 18 May 1918.', u'During his service at headquarters, Hitler pursued his artwork, drawing cartoons and instructions for an army newspaper.', u"During the Battle of the Somme in October 1916, he was wounded in the left thigh when a shell exploded in the dispatch runners' dugout.", u'Hitler spent almost two months in hospital at Beelitz, returning to his regiment on 5 March 1917.', u'On 15 October 1918, he was temporarily blinded in a mustard gas attack and was hospitalised in Pasewalk.', u"While there, Hitler learnt of Germany's defeat, and\u2014by his own account\u2014upon receiving this news, he suffered a second bout of blindness.", u'Hitler described the war as "the greatest of all experiences", and was praised by his commanding officers for his bravery.', u"His wartime experience reinforced his German patriotism and he was shocked by Germany's capitulation in November 1918.", u'His bitterness over the collapse of the war effort began to shape his ideology.', u'Like other German nationalists, he believed the Dolchsto\xdflegende (stab-in-the-back myth), which claimed that the German army, "undefeated in the field", had been "stabbed in the back" on the home front by civilian leaders and Marxists, later dubbed the "November criminals".', u'The Treaty of Versailles stipulated that Germany must relinquish several of its territories and demilitarise the Rhineland.', u'The treaty imposed economic sanctions and levied heavy reparations on the country.', u'Many Germans saw the treaty as an unjust humiliation\u2014they especially objected to Article 231, which they interpreted as declaring Germany responsible for the war.', u'The Versailles Treaty and the economic, social, and political conditions in Germany after the war were later exploited by Hitler for political gain.', u'== Entry into politics ==\n\nAfter World War I, Hitler returned to Munich.', u'With no formal education or career prospects, he remained in the army.', u"In July 1919 he was appointed Verbindungsmann (intelligence agent) of an Aufkl\xe4rungskommando (reconnaissance commando) of the Reichswehr, assigned to influence other soldiers and to infiltrate the German Workers' Party (DAP).", u"While monitoring the activities of the DAP, Hitler was attracted to the founder Anton Drexler's anti-Semitic, nationalist, anti-capitalist, and anti-Marxist ideas.", u'Drexler favoured a strong active government, a non-Jewish version of socialism, and solidarity among all members of society.', u"Impressed with Hitler's oratorical skills, Drexler invited him to join the DAP.", u'Hitler accepted on 12 September 1919, becoming party member 555 (the party began counting membership at 500 to give the impression they were a much larger party).', u"At the DAP, Hitler met Dietrich Eckart, one of the party's founders and a member of the occult Thule Society.", u"Eckart became Hitler's mentor, exchanging ideas with him and introducing him to a wide range of Munich society.", u'To increase its appeal, the DAP changed its name to the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (National Socialist German Workers Party; NSDAP).', u"Hitler designed the party's banner of a swastika in a white circle on a red background.", u'Hitler was discharged from the army on 31 March 1920 and began working full-time for the NSDAP.', u'The party headquarters was in Munich, a hotbed of anti-government German nationalists determined to crush Marxism and undermine the Weimar Republic.', u'In February 1921\u2014already highly effective at speaking to large audiences\u2014he spoke to a crowd of over 6,000.', u'To publicise the meeting, two truckloads of party supporters drove around Munich waving swastika flags and distributing leaflets.', u'Hitler soon gained notoriety for his rowdy polemic speeches against the Treaty of Versailles, rival politicians, and especially against Marxists and Jews.', u'In June 1921, while Hitler and Eckart were on a fundraising trip to Berlin, a mutiny broke out within the NSDAP in Munich.', u'Members of its executive committee wanted to merge with the rival German Socialist Party (DSP).', u'Hitler returned to Munich on 11 July and angrily tendered his resignation.', u'The committee members realised that the resignation of their leading public figure and speaker would mean the end of the party.', u'Hitler announced he would rejoin on the condition that he would replace Drexler as party chairman, and that the party headquarters would remain in Munich.', u'The committee agreed, and he rejoined the party on 26 July as member 3,680.', u'Hitler continued to face some opposition within the NSDAP: Opponents of Hitler in the leadership had Hermann Esser expelled from the party, and they printed 3,000 copies of a pamphlet attacking Hitler as a traitor to the party.', u'In the following days, Hitler spoke to several packed houses and defended himself and Esser, to thunderous applause.', u'His strategy proved successful, and at a special party congress on 29 July, he was granted absolute powers as party chairman, replacing Drexler, by a vote of 533 to 1.', u"Hitler's vitriolic beer hall speeches began attracting regular audiences.", u"He became adept at using populist themes, including the use of scapegoats, who were blamed for his listeners' economic hardships.", u'Hitler used personal magnetism and an understanding of crowd psychology to his advantage while engaged in public speaking.', u'Historians have noted the hypnotic effect of his rhetoric on large audiences, and of his eyes in small groups.', u'Alfons Heck, a former member of the Hitler Youth, later recalled:\n\nWe erupted into a frenzy of nationalistic pride that bordered on hysteria.', u'For minutes on end, we shouted at the top of our lungs, with tears streaming down our faces: Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil!', u'From that moment on, I belonged to Adolf Hitler body and soul.', u'Some visitors who met Hitler privately noted that his appearance and demeanour failed to make a lasting impression.', u'Early followers included Rudolf Hess, former air force ace Hermann G\xf6ring, and army captain Ernst R\xf6hm.', u'R\xf6hm became head of the Nazis\' paramilitary organisation, the Sturmabteilung (SA, "Stormtroopers"), which protected meetings and attacked political opponents.', u"A critical influence on Hitler's thinking during this period was the Aufbau Vereinigung, a conspiratorial group of White Russian exiles and early National Socialists.", u'The group, financed with funds channelled from wealthy industrialists, introduced Hitler to the idea of a Jewish conspiracy, linking international finance with Bolshevism.', u'=== Beer Hall Putsch ===\n\nIn 1923 Hitler enlisted the help of World War I General Erich Ludendorff for an attempted coup known as the "Beer Hall Putsch".', u'The NSDAP used Italian Fascism as a model for their appearance and policies.', u'Hitler wanted to emulate Benito Mussolini\'s "March on Rome" of 1922 by staging his own coup in Bavaria, to be followed by a challenge to the government in Berlin.', u"Hitler and Ludendorff sought the support of Staatskommissar (state commissioner) Gustav Ritter von Kahr, Bavaria's de facto ruler.", u'However, Kahr, along with Police Chief Hans Ritter von Seisser and Reichswehr General Otto von Lossow, wanted to install a nationalist dictatorship without Hitler.', u'On 8 November 1923 Hitler and the SA stormed a public meeting of 3,000 people organised by Kahr in the B\xfcrgerbr\xe4ukeller, a beer hall in Munich.', u"Interrupting Kahr's speech, he announced that the national revolution had begun and declared the formation of a new government with Ludendorff.", u'Retiring to a back room, Hitler, with handgun drawn, demanded and got the support of Kahr, Seisser, and Lossow.', u"Hitler's forces initially succeeded in occupying the local Reichswehr and police headquarters, but Kahr and his cohorts quickly withdrew their support.", u'Neither the army nor the state police joined forces with Hitler.', u'The next day, Hitler and his followers marched from the beer hall to the Bavarian War Ministry to overthrow the Bavarian government, but police dispersed them.', u'Sixteen NSDAP members and four police officers were killed in the failed coup.', u'Hitler fled to the home of Ernst Hanfstaengl and by some accounts contemplated suicide.', u'He was depressed but calm when arrested on 11 November 1923 for high treason.', u"His trial before the special People's Court in Munich began in February 1924, and Alfred Rosenberg became temporary leader of the NSDAP.", u"On 1 April, Hitler was sentenced to five years' imprisonment at Landsberg Prison.", u'There, he received friendly treatment from the guards, and he was allowed mail from supporters and regular visits by party comrades.', u"Pardoned by the Bavarian Supreme Court, he was released from jail on 20 December 1924, against the state prosecutor's objections.", u'Including time on remand, Hitler served just over one year in prison.', u'While at Landsberg, Hitler dictated most of the first volume of Mein Kampf (My Struggle; originally entitled Four and a Half Years of Struggle against Lies, Stupidity, and Cowardice) to his deputy, Rudolf Hess.', u'The book, dedicated to Thule Society member Dietrich Eckart, was an autobiography and exposition of his ideology.', u"The book laid out Hitler's plans for transforming German society into one based on race.", u'Some passages implied genocide.', u'Published in two volumes in 1925 and 1926, it sold 228,000 copies between 1925 and 1932.', u"One million copies were sold in 1933, Hitler's first year in office.", u'Shortly before Hitler was eligible for parole, the Bavarian government attempted to have him deported back to Austria.', u'The Austrian federal chancellor rejected the request on the specious grounds that his service in the German Army made his Austrian citizenship void.', u'In response, Hitler formally renounced his Austrian citizenship on 7 April 1925.', u"=== Rebuilding the NSDAP ===\nAt the time of Hitler's release from prison, politics in Germany had become less combative and the economy had improved, limiting Hitler's opportunities for political agitation.", u'As a result of the failed Beer Hall Putsch, the NSDAP and its affiliated organisations were banned in Bavaria.', u'In a meeting with Prime Minister of Bavaria Heinrich Held on 4 January 1925, Hitler agreed to respect the authority of the state and promised that he would seek political power only through the democratic process.', u'The meeting paved the way for the ban on the NSDAP to be lifted on 16 February.', u'Hitler was barred from public speaking by the Bavarian authorities, a ban that remained in place until 1927.', u'To advance his political ambitions in spite of the ban, Hitler appointed Gregor Strasser, Otto Strasser, and Joseph Goebbels to organise and grow the NSDAP in northern Germany.', u"A superb organiser, Gregor Strasser steered a more independent political course, emphasising the socialist elements of the party's programme.", u'The stock market in the United States crashed on 24 October 1929.', u'The impact in Germany was dire: millions were thrown out of work and several major banks collapsed.', u'Hitler and the NSDAP prepared to take advantage of the emergency to gain support for their party.', u'They promised to repudiate the Versailles Treaty, strengthen the economy, and provide jobs.', u'== Rise to power ==\n\n\n=== Br\xfcning administration ===\nThe Great Depression provided a political opportunity for Hitler.', u'Germans were ambivalent about the parliamentary republic, which faced challenges from right- and left-wing extremists.', u'The moderate political parties were increasingly unable to stem the tide of extremism, and the German referendum of 1929 helped to elevate Nazi ideology.', u'The elections of September 1930 resulted in the break-up of a grand coalition and its replacement with a minority cabinet.', u'Its leader, chancellor Heinrich Br\xfcning of the Centre Party, governed through emergency decrees from President Paul von Hindenburg.', u'Governance by decree became the new norm and paved the way for authoritarian forms of government.', u'The NSDAP rose from obscurity to win 18.3 per cent of the vote and 107 parliamentary seats in the 1930 election, becoming the second-largest party in parliament.', u'Hitler made a prominent appearance at the trial of two Reichswehr officers, Lieutenants Richard Scheringer and Hans Ludin, in late 1930.', u'Both were charged with membership in the NSDAP, at that time illegal for Reichswehr personnel.', u'The prosecution argued that the NSDAP was an extremist party, prompting defence lawyer Hans Frank to call on Hitler to testify.', u'On 25 September 1930, Hitler testified that his party would pursue political power solely through democratic elections, which won him many supporters in the officer corps.', u"Br\xfcning's austerity measures brought little economic improvement and were extremely unpopular.", u'Hitler exploited this by targeting his political messages specifically at people who had been affected by the inflation of the 1920s and the Depression, such as farmers, war veterans, and the middle class.', u'Although Hitler had terminated his Austrian citizenship in 1925, he did not acquire German citizenship for almost seven years.', u'This meant he was stateless, unable to run for public office, and still faced the risk of deportation.', u"On 25 February 1932, the interior minister of Brunswick, Dietrich Klagges, who was a member of the NSDAP, appointed Hitler as administrator for the state's delegation to the Reichsrat in Berlin, making Hitler a citizen of Brunswick, and thus of Germany.", u'In 1932, Hitler ran against Hindenburg in the presidential elections.', u"A 27 January 1932 speech to the Industry Club in D\xfcsseldorf won him support from many of Germany's most powerful industrialists.", u'Hindenburg had support from various nationalist, monarchist, Catholic, and republican parties, and some Social Democrats.', u'Hitler used the campaign slogan "Hitler \xfcber Deutschland" ("Hitler over Germany"), a reference to his political ambitions and his campaigning by aircraft.', u'He was one of the first politicians to use aircraft travel for political purposes, and utilised it effectively.', u'Hitler came in second in both rounds of the election, garnering more than 35 per cent of the vote in the final election.', u'Although he lost to Hindenburg, this election established Hitler as a strong force in German politics.', u'=== Appointment as chancellor ===\nThe absence of an effective government prompted two influential politicians, Franz von Papen and Alfred Hugenberg, along with several other industrialists and businessmen, to write a letter to Hindenburg.', u'The signers urged Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as leader of a government "independent from parliamentary parties", which could turn into a movement that would "enrapture millions of people".', u'Hindenburg reluctantly agreed to appoint Hitler as chancellor after two further parliamentary elections\u2014in July and November 1932\u2014had not resulted in the formation of a majority government.', u"Hitler headed a short-lived coalition government formed by the NSDAP and Hugenberg's party, the German National People's Party (DNVP).", u"On 30 January 1933, the new cabinet was sworn in during a brief ceremony in Hindenburg's office.", u'The NSDAP gained three posts: Hitler was named chancellor, Wilhelm Frick Minister of the Interior, and Hermann G\xf6ring Minister of the Interior for Prussia.', u'Hitler had insisted on the ministerial positions as a way to gain control over the police in much of Germany.', u"=== Reichstag fire and March elections ===\nAs chancellor, Hitler worked against attempts by the NSDAP's opponents to build a majority government.", u'Because of the political stalemate, he asked Hindenburg to again dissolve the Reichstag, and elections were scheduled for early March.', u'On 27 February 1933, the Reichstag building was set on fire.', u'G\xf6ring blamed a communist plot, because Dutch communist Marinus van der Lubbe was found in incriminating circumstances inside the burning building.', u'According to the British historian Sir Ian Kershaw, the consensus of nearly all historians is that van der Lubbe actually set the fire.', u'Others, including William L. Shirer and Alan Bullock, are of the opinion that the NSDAP itself was responsible.', u"At Hitler's urging, Hindenburg responded with the Reichstag Fire Decree of 28 February, which suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial.", u'The decree was permitted under Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution, which gave the president the power to take emergency measures to protect public safety and order.', u'Activities of the German Communist Party (KPD) were suppressed, and some 4,000 communist party members were arrested.', u'In addition to political campaigning, the NSDAP engaged in paramilitary violence and the spread of anti-communist propaganda in the days preceding the election.', u"On election day, 6 March 1933, the NSDAP's share of the vote increased to 43.9 per cent, and the party acquired the largest number of seats in parliament.", u"Hitler's party failed to secure an absolute majority, necessitating another coalition with the DNVP.", u'=== Day of Potsdam and the Enabling Act ===\n\nOn 21 March 1933, the new Reichstag was constituted with an opening ceremony at the Garrison Church in Potsdam.', u'This "Day of Potsdam" was held to demonstrate unity between the Nazi movement and the old Prussian elite and military.', u'Hitler appeared in a morning coat and humbly greeted Hindenburg.', u"To achieve full political control despite not having an absolute majority in parliament, Hitler's government brought the Erm\xe4chtigungsgesetz (Enabling Act) to a vote in the newly elected Reichstag.", u'The Act\u2014officially titled the Gesetz zur Behebung der Not von Volk und Reich ("Law to Remedy the Distress of People and Reich")\u2014gave Hitler\'s cabinet the power to enact laws without the consent of the Reichstag for four years.', u'These laws could (with certain exceptions) deviate from the constitution.', u'Since it would affect the constitution, the Enabling Act required a two-thirds majority to pass.', u'Leaving nothing to chance, the Nazis used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to arrest all 81 Communist deputies (in spite of their virulent campaign against the party, the Nazis had allowed the KPD to contest the election) and prevent several Social Democrats from attending.', u'On 23 March 1933, the Reichstag assembled at the Kroll Opera House under turbulent circumstances.', u'Ranks of SA men served as guards inside the building, while large groups outside opposing the proposed legislation shouted slogans and threats towards the arriving members of parliament.', u'The position of the Centre Party, the third largest party in the Reichstag, was decisive.', u'After Hitler verbally promised party leader Ludwig Kaas that Hindenburg would retain his power of veto, Kaas announced the Centre Party would support the Enabling Act.', u'The Act passed by a vote of 441\u201384, with all parties except the Social Democrats voting in favour.', u"The Enabling Act, along with the Reichstag Fire Decree, transformed Hitler's government into a de facto legal dictatorship.", u'=== Dictatorship ===\n\nAt the risk of appearing to talk nonsense I tell you that the National Socialist movement will go on for 1,000 years!', u"... Don't forget how people laughed at me 15 years ago when I declared that one day I would govern Germany.", u'They laugh now, just as foolishly, when I declare that I shall remain in power!', u'Having achieved full control over the legislative and executive branches of government, Hitler and his allies began to suppress the remaining opposition.', u'The Social Democratic Party was banned and its assets seized.', u'While many trade union delegates were in Berlin for May Day activities, SA stormtroopers demolished union offices around the country.', u'On 2 May 1933 all trade unions were forced to dissolve and their leaders were arrested.', u'Some were sent to concentration camps.', u'The German Labour Front was formed as an umbrella organisation to represent all workers, administrators, and company owners, thus reflecting the concept of national socialism in the spirit of Hitler\'s Volksgemeinschaft ("people\'s community").', u'By the end of June, the other parties had been intimidated into disbanding.', u"This included the Nazis' nominal coalition partner, the DNVP; with the SA's help, Hitler forced its leader, Hugenberg, to resign on 29 June.", u'On 14 July 1933, the NSDAP was declared the only legal political party in Germany.', u'The demands of the SA for more political and military power caused anxiety among military, industrial, and political leaders.', u'In response, Hitler purged the entire SA leadership in the Night of the Long Knives, which took place from 30 June to 2 July 1934.', u"Hitler targeted Ernst R\xf6hm and other SA leaders who, along with a number of Hitler's political adversaries (such as Gregor Strasser and former chancellor Kurt von Schleicher), were rounded up, arrested, and shot.", u'While the international community and some Germans were shocked by the murders, many in Germany believed Hitler was restoring order.', u'On 2 August 1934, Hindenburg died.', u'The previous day, the cabinet had enacted the "Law Concerning the Highest State Office of the Reich".', u"This law stated that upon Hindenburg's death, the office of president would be abolished and its powers merged with those of the chancellor.", u'Hitler thus became head of state as well as head of government, and was formally named as F\xfchrer und Reichskanzler (leader and chancellor).', u'With this action, Hitler eliminated the last legal remedy by which he could be removed from office.', u'As head of state, Hitler became supreme commander of the armed forces.', u'The traditional loyalty oath of servicemen was altered to affirm loyalty to Hitler personally, by name, rather than to the office of supreme commander or the state.', u'On 19 August, the merger of the presidency with the chancellorship was approved by 90 per cent of the electorate voting in a plebiscite.', u'In early 1938, Hitler used blackmail to consolidate his hold over the military by instigating the Blomberg\u2013Fritsch Affair.', u"Hitler forced his War Minister, Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg, to resign by using a police dossier that showed that Blomberg's new wife had a record for prostitution.", u'Army commander Colonel-General Werner von Fritsch was removed after the Schutzstaffel (SS) produced allegations that he had engaged in a homosexual relationship.', u"Both men had fallen into disfavour because they objected to Hitler's demand to make the Wehrmacht ready for war as early as 1938.", u"Hitler assumed Blomberg's title of Commander-in-Chief, thus taking personal command of the armed forces.", u'He replaced the Ministry of War with the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Armed Forces High Command: OKW), headed by General Wilhelm Keitel.', u'On the same day, sixteen generals were stripped of their commands and 44 more were transferred; all were suspected of not being sufficiently pro-Nazi.', u'By early February 1938, twelve more generals had been removed.', u'Hitler took care to give his dictatorship the appearance of legality.', u'Many of his decrees were explicitly based on the Reichstag Fire Decree and hence on Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution.', u'The Reichstag renewed the Enabling Act twice, each time for a four-year period.', u'While elections to the Reichstag were still held (in 1933, 1936, and 1938), voters were presented with a single list of Nazis and pro-Nazi "guests" which carried with well over 90 percent of the vote.', u"These elections were held in far-from-secret conditions; the Nazis threatened severe reprisals against anyone who didn't vote or dared to vote no.", u'== Nazi Germany ==\n\n\n=== Economy and culture ===\n\nIn August 1934, Hitler appointed Reichsbank President Hjalmar Schacht as Minister of Economics, and in the following year, as Plenipotentiary for War Economy in charge of preparing the economy for war.', u'Reconstruction and rearmament were financed through Mefo bills, printing money, and seizing the assets of people arrested as enemies of the State, including Jews.', u'Unemployment fell from six million in 1932 to one million in 1936.', u'Hitler oversaw one of the largest infrastructure improvement campaigns in German history, leading to the construction of dams, autobahns, railroads, and other civil works.', u'Wages were slightly lower in the mid to late 1930s compared with wages during the Weimar Republic, while the cost of living increased by 25 per cent.', u'The average work week increased during the shift to a war economy; by 1939, the average German was working between 47 and 50 hours a week.', u"Hitler's government sponsored architecture on an immense scale.", u"Albert Speer, instrumental in implementing Hitler's classicist reinterpretation of German culture, was placed in charge of the proposed architectural renovations of Berlin.", u'Despite a threatened multi-nation boycott, Germany hosted the 1936 Olympic Games.', u'Hitler officiated at the opening ceremonies and attended events at both the Winter Games in Garmisch-Partenkirchen and the Summer Games in Berlin.', u'=== Rearmament and new alliances ===\n\nIn a meeting with German military leaders on 3 February 1933, Hitler spoke of "conquest for Lebensraum in the East and its ruthless Germanisation" as his ultimate foreign policy objectives.', u"In March, Prince Bernhard Wilhelm von B\xfclow, secretary at the Ausw\xe4rtiges Amt (Foreign Office), issued a statement of major foreign policy aims: Anschluss with Austria, the restoration of Germany's national borders of 1914, rejection of military restrictions under the Treaty of Versailles, the return of the former German colonies in Africa, and a German zone of influence in Eastern Europe.", u"Hitler found B\xfclow's goals to be too modest.", u'In speeches during this period, he stressed the peaceful goals of his policies and a willingness to work within international agreements.', u'At the first meeting of his cabinet in 1933, Hitler prioritised military spending over unemployment relief.', u'Germany withdrew from the League of Nations and the World Disarmament Conference in October 1933.', u'In January 1935, over 90 per cent of the people of the Saarland, then under League of Nations administration, voted to unite with Germany.', u'That March, Hitler announced an expansion of the Wehrmacht to 600,000 members\u2014six times the number permitted by the Versailles Treaty\u2014including development of an air force (Luftwaffe) and an increase in the size of the navy (Kriegsmarine).', u'Britain, France, Italy, and the League of Nations condemned these violations of the Treaty, but did nothing to stop it.', u'The Anglo-German Naval Agreement (AGNA) of 18 June allowed German tonnage to increase to 35 per cent of that of the British navy.', u'Hitler called the signing of the AGNA "the happiest day of his life", believing that the agreement marked the beginning of the Anglo-German alliance he had predicted in Mein Kampf.', u'France and Italy were not consulted before the signing, directly undermining the League of Nations and setting the Treaty of Versailles on the path towards irrelevance.', u'Germany reoccupied the demilitarised zone in the Rhineland in March 1936, in violation of the Versailles Treaty.', u'Hitler also sent troops to Spain to support General Franco during the Spanish Civil War after receiving an appeal for help in July 1936.', u'At the same time, Hitler continued his efforts to create an Anglo-German alliance.', u'In August 1936, in response to a growing economic crisis caused by his rearmament efforts, Hitler ordered G\xf6ring to implement a Four Year Plan to prepare Germany for war within the next four years.', u'The plan envisaged an all-out struggle between "Judeo-Bolshevism" and German national socialism, which in Hitler\'s view required a committed effort of rearmament regardless of the economic costs.', u"Count Galeazzo Ciano, foreign minister of Mussolini's government, declared an axis between Germany and Italy, and on 25 November, Germany signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan.", u'Britain, China, Italy, and Poland were also invited to join the Anti-Comintern Pact, but only Italy signed in 1937.', u'Hitler abandoned his plan of an Anglo-German alliance, blaming "inadequate" British leadership.', u'At a meeting in the Reich Chancellery with his foreign ministers and military chiefs that November, Hitler restated his intention of acquiring Lebensraum for the German people.', u'He ordered preparations for war in the East, to begin as early as 1938 and no later than 1943.', u'In the event of his death, the conference minutes, recorded as the Hossbach Memorandum, were to be regarded as his "political testament".', u'He felt that a severe decline in living standards in Germany as a result of the economic crisis could only be stopped by military aggression aimed at seizing Austria and Czechoslovakia.', u'Hitler urged quick action before Britain and France gained a permanent lead in the arms race.', u'In early 1938, in the wake of the Blomberg\u2013Fritsch Affair, Hitler asserted control of the military-foreign policy apparatus, dismissing Neurath as foreign minister and appointing himself Oberster Befehlshaber der Wehrmacht (supreme commander of the armed forces).', u'From early 1938 onwards, Hitler was carrying out a foreign policy ultimately aimed at war.', u'== World War II ==\n\n\n=== Early diplomatic successes ===\n\n\n==== Alliance with Japan ====\n\nIn February 1938, on the advice of his newly appointed foreign minister, the strongly pro-Japanese Joachim von Ribbentrop, Hitler ended the Sino-German alliance with the Republic of China to instead enter into an alliance with the more modern and powerful Japan.', u'Hitler announced German recognition of Manchukuo, the Japanese-occupied state in Manchuria, and renounced German claims to their former colonies in the Pacific held by Japan.', u'Hitler ordered an end to arms shipments to China and recalled all German officers working with the Chinese Army.', u'In retaliation, Chinese General Chiang Kai-shek cancelled all Sino-German economic agreements, depriving the Germans of many Chinese raw materials.', u'==== Austria and Czechoslovakia ====\nOn 12 March 1938, Hitler announced the unification of Austria with Nazi Germany in the Anschluss.', u'Hitler then turned his attention to the ethnic German population of the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia.', u'On 28\u201329 March 1938, Hitler held a series of secret meetings in Berlin with Konrad Henlein of the Sudeten Heimfront (Home Front), the largest of the ethnic German parties of the Sudetenland.', u'The men agreed that Henlein would demand increased autonomy for Sudeten Germans from the Czechoslovakian government, thus providing a pretext for German military action against Czechoslovakia.', u'In April 1938 Henlein told the foreign minister of Hungary that "whatever the Czech government might offer, he would always raise still higher demands ... he wanted to sabotage an understanding by any means because this was the only method to blow up Czechoslovakia quickly".', u'In private, Hitler considered the Sudeten issue unimportant; his real intention was a war of conquest against Czechoslovakia.', u'In April Hitler ordered the OKW to prepare for Fall Gr\xfcn (Case Green), the code name for an invasion of Czechoslovakia.', u'As a result of intense French and British diplomatic pressure, on 5 September Czechoslovakian President Edvard Bene\u0161 unveiled the "Fourth Plan" for constitutional reorganisation of his country, which agreed to most of Henlein\'s demands for Sudeten autonomy.', u"Henlein's Heimfront responded to Bene\u0161' offer by instigating a series of violent clashes with the Czechoslovakian police that led to the declaration of martial law in certain Sudeten districts.", u"Germany was dependent on imported oil; a confrontation with Britain over the Czechoslovakian dispute could curtail Germany's oil supplies.", u'This forced Hitler to call off Fall Gr\xfcn, originally planned for 1 October 1938.', u'On 29 September Hitler, Neville Chamberlain, \xc9douard Daladier, and Mussolini attended a one-day conference in Munich that led to the Munich Agreement, which handed over the Sudetenland districts to Germany.', u'Chamberlain was satisfied with the Munich conference, calling the outcome "peace for our time", while Hitler was angered about the missed opportunity for war in 1938; he expressed his disappointment in a speech on 9 October in Saarbr\xfccken.', u"In Hitler's view, the British-brokered peace, although favourable to the ostensible German demands, was a diplomatic defeat which spurred his intent of limiting British power to pave the way for the eastern expansion of Germany.", u"As a result of the summit, Hitler was selected Time magazine's Man of the Year for 1938.", u'In late 1938 and early 1939, the continuing economic crisis caused by rearmament forced Hitler to make major defence cuts.', u'In his "Export or die" speech of 30 January 1939, he called for an economic offensive to increase German foreign exchange holdings to pay for raw materials such as high-grade iron needed for military weapons.', u'On 15 March 1939, in violation of the Munich accord and possibly as a result of the deepening economic crisis requiring additional assets, Hitler ordered the Wehrmacht to invade Prague, and from Prague Castle he proclaimed Bohemia and Moravia a German protectorate.', u"=== Start of World War II ===\nIn private discussions in 1939, Hitler declared Britain the main enemy to be defeated and that Poland's obliteration was a necessary prelude for that goal.", u"The eastern flank would be secured and land would be added to Germany's Lebensraum.", u'Offended by the British "guarantee" on 31 March 1939 of Polish independence, he said, "I shall brew them a devil\'s drink".', u'In a speech in Wilhelmshaven for the launch of the battleship Tirpitz on 1 April, he threatened to denounce the Anglo-German Naval Agreement if the British continued to guarantee Polish independence, which he perceived as an "encirclement" policy.', u"Poland was to either become a German satellite state or be neutralised to secure the Reich's eastern flank and to prevent a possible British blockade.", u'Hitler initially favoured the idea of a satellite state, but upon its rejection by the Polish government, he decided to invade and made this the main foreign policy goal of 1939.', u'On 3 April, Hitler ordered the military to prepare for Fall Weiss ("Case White"), the plan for invading Poland on 25 August.', u'In a Reichstag speech on 28 April, he renounced both the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the German\u2013Polish Non-Aggression Pact.', u"Historians such as William Carr, Gerhard Weinberg, and Kershaw have argued that one reason for Hitler's rush to war was his fear of an early death.", u'Hitler was concerned that a military attack against Poland could result in a premature war with Britain.', u"Hitler's foreign minister and former Ambassador to London, Joachim von Ribbentrop, assured him that neither Britain nor France would honour their commitments to Poland.", u'Accordingly, on 22 August 1939 Hitler ordered a military mobilisation against Poland.', u'This plan required tacit Soviet support, and the non-aggression pact (the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact) between Germany and the Soviet Union, led by Joseph Stalin, included a secret agreement to partition Poland between the two countries.', u"Contrary to Ribbentrop's prediction that Britain would sever Anglo-Polish ties, Britain and Poland signed the Anglo-Polish alliance on 25 August 1939.", u'This, along with news from Italy that Mussolini would not honour the Pact of Steel, prompted Hitler to postpone the attack on Poland from 25 August to 1 September.', u'Hitler unsuccessfully tried to manoeuvre the British into neutrality by offering them a non-aggression guarantee on 25 August; he then instructed Ribbentrop to present a last-minute peace plan with an impossibly short time limit in an effort to blame the imminent war on British and Polish inaction.', u'On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded western Poland under the pretext of having been denied claims to the Free City of Danzig and the right to extraterritorial roads across the Polish Corridor, which Germany had ceded under the Versailles Treaty.', u'In response, Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September, surprising Hitler and prompting him to angrily ask Ribbentrop, "Now what?"', u'France and Britain did not act on their declarations immediately, and on 17 September, Soviet forces invaded eastern Poland.', u'The fall of Poland was followed by what contemporary journalists dubbed the "Phoney War" or Sitzkrieg ("sitting war").', u'Hitler instructed the two newly appointed Gauleiters of north-western Poland, Albert Forster of Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia and Arthur Greiser of Reichsgau Wartheland, to Germanise their areas, with "no questions asked" about how this was accomplished.', u"Whereas Polish citizens in Forster's area merely had to sign forms stating that they had German blood, Greiser carried out a brutal ethnic cleansing campaign on the Polish population in his purview.", u'Greiser complained that Forster was allowing thousands of Poles to be accepted as "racial" Germans and thus endangered German "racial purity".', u'Hitler refrained from getting involved.', u'This inaction has been advanced as an example of the theory of "working towards the F\xfchrer": Hitler issued vague instructions and expected his subordinates to work out policies on their own.', u'Another dispute pitched one side represented by Himmler and Greiser, who championed ethnic cleansing in Poland, against another represented by G\xf6ring and Hans Frank, governor-general of the General Government territory of occupied Poland, who called for turning Poland into the "granary" of the Reich.', u'On 12 February 1940, the dispute was initially settled in favour of the G\xf6ring\u2013Frank view, which ended the economically disruptive mass expulsions.', u'On 15 May 1940, Himmler issued a memo entitled "Some Thoughts on the Treatment of Alien Population in the East", calling for the expulsion of the entire Jewish population of Europe into Africa and reducing the Polish population to a "leaderless class of labourers".', u'Hitler called Himmler\'s memo "good and correct", and, ignoring G\xf6ring and Frank, implemented the Himmler\u2013Greiser policy in Poland.', u"Hitler began a military build-up on Germany's western border, and in April 1940, German forces invaded Denmark and Norway.", u'On 9 April, Hitler proclaimed the birth of the Greater Germanic Reich, his vision of a united empire of the Germanic nations of Europe, where the Dutch, Flemish, and Scandinavians were joined into a "racially pure" polity under German leadership.', u'In May 1940, Germany attacked France, and conquered Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Belgium.', u'These victories prompted Mussolini to have Italy join forces with Hitler on 10 June.', u'France and Germany signed an armistice on 22 June.', u"Kershaw notes that Hitler's popularity within Germany \u2013 and German support for the war \u2013 reached its peak when he returned to Berlin on 6 July from his tour of Paris.", u'Following the unexpected swift victory, Hitler promoted twelve generals to the rank of field marshal during the 1940 Field Marshal Ceremony.', u'Britain, whose troops were forced to evacuate France by sea from Dunkirk, continued to fight alongside other British dominions in the Battle of the Atlantic.', u'Hitler made peace overtures to the new British leader, Winston Churchill, and upon their rejection he ordered a series of aerial attacks on Royal Air Force airbases and radar stations in south-east England.', u'The German Luftwaffe failed to defeat the Royal Air Force in what became known as the Battle of Britain.', u'By the end of October, Hitler realised that air superiority for the invasion of Britain (in Operation Sea Lion) could not be achieved, and he ordered nightly air raids on British cities, including London, Plymouth, and Coventry.', u'On 27 September 1940, the Tripartite Pact was signed in Berlin by Sabur\u014d Kurusu of Imperial Japan, Hitler, and Italian foreign minister Ciano, and later expanded to include Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, thus yielding the Axis powers.', u"Hitler's attempt to integrate the Soviet Union into the anti-British bloc failed after inconclusive talks between Hitler and Molotov in Berlin in November, and he ordered preparations for the invasion of the Soviet Union.", u'In early 1941, German forces were deployed to North Africa, the Balkans, and the Middle East.', u'In February, German forces arrived in Libya to bolster the Italian presence.', u'In April, Hitler launched the invasion of Yugoslavia, quickly followed by the invasion of Greece.', u'In May, German forces were sent to support Iraqi rebel forces fighting against the British and to invade Crete.', u'=== Path to defeat ===\nOn 22 June 1941, contravening the Hitler\u2013Stalin Non-Aggression Pact of 1939, 4\u20135 million Axis troops attacked the Soviet Union.', u'This offensive (codenamed Operation Barbarossa) was intended to destroy the Soviet Union and seize its natural resources for subsequent aggression against the Western powers.', u'The invasion conquered a huge area, including the Baltic republics, Belarus, and West Ukraine.', u'By early August, Axis troops had advanced 500 km (310 mi) and won the Battle of Smolensk.', u'Hitler ordered Army Group Centre to temporarily halt its advance to Moscow and divert its Panzer groups to aid in the encirclement of Leningrad and Kiev.', u'His generals disagreed with this change, having advanced within 400 km (250 mi) of Moscow, and his decision caused a crisis among the military leadership.', u'The pause provided the Red Army with an opportunity to mobilise fresh reserves; historian Russel Stolfi considers it to be one of the major factors that caused the failure of the Moscow offensive, which was resumed in October 1941 and ended disastrously in December.', u'On 7 December 1941, Japan attacked the American fleet based at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.', u'Four days later, Hitler declared war against the United States.', u'On 18 December 1941, Himmler asked Hitler, "What to do with the Jews of Russia?', u'", to which Hitler replied, "als Partisanen auszurotten" ("exterminate them as partisans").', u'Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer has commented that the remark is probably as close as historians will ever get to a definitive order from Hitler for the genocide carried out during the Holocaust.', u"In late 1942, German forces were defeated in the second battle of El Alamein, thwarting Hitler's plans to seize the Suez Canal and the Middle East.", u'Overconfident in his own military expertise following the earlier victories in 1940, Hitler became distrustful of his Army High Command and began to interfere in military and tactical planning, with damaging consequences.', u"In December 1942 and January 1943, Hitler's repeated refusal to allow their withdrawal at the Battle of Stalingrad led to the almost total destruction of the 6th Army.", u'Over 200,000 Axis soldiers were killed and 235,000 were taken prisoner.', u'Thereafter came a decisive strategic defeat at the Battle of Kursk.', u"Hitler's military judgement became increasingly erratic, and Germany's military and economic position deteriorated, as did Hitler's health.", u'Following the allied invasion of Sicily in 1943, Mussolini was removed from power by Victor Emmanuel III after a vote of no confidence of the Grand Council.', u'Marshal Pietro Badoglio, placed in charge of the government, soon surrendered to the Allies.', u"Throughout 1943 and 1944, the Soviet Union steadily forced Hitler's armies into retreat along the Eastern Front.", u'On 6 June 1944, the Western Allied armies landed in northern France in one of the largest amphibious operations in history, Operation Overlord.', u"Many German officers concluded that defeat was inevitable and that continuing under Hitler's leadership would result in the complete destruction of the country.", u'Between 1939 and 1945, there were many plans to assassinate Hitler, some of which proceeded to significant degrees.', u'The most well known came from within Germany and was at least partly driven by the increasing prospect of a German defeat in the war.', u"In July 1944, in the 20 July plot, part of Operation Valkyrie, Claus von Stauffenberg planted a bomb in one of Hitler's headquarters, the Wolf's Lair at Rastenburg.", u'Hitler narrowly survived because staff officer Heinz Brandt moved the briefcase containing the bomb behind a leg of the heavy conference table, which deflected much of the blast.', u'Later, Hitler ordered savage reprisals resulting in the execution of more than 4,900 people.', u'=== Defeat and death ===\n\nBy late 1944, both the Red Army and the Western Allies were advancing into Germany.', u'Recognising the strength and determination of the Red Army, Hitler decided to use his remaining mobile reserves against the American and British troops, which he perceived as far weaker.', u'On 16 December, he launched the Ardennes Offensive to incite disunity among the Western Allies and perhaps convince them to join his fight against the Soviets.', u'The offensive failed after some temporary successes.', u'With much of Germany in ruins in January 1945, Hitler spoke on the radio: "However grave as the crisis may be at this moment, it will, despite everything, be mastered by our unalterable will."', u"Hitler's hope to negotiate peace with the United States and Britain was encouraged by the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt on 12 April 1945, but contrary to his expectations, this caused no rift among the Allies.", u"Acting on his view that Germany's military failures meant it had forfeited its right to survive as a nation, Hitler ordered the destruction of all German industrial infrastructure before it could fall into Allied hands.", u'Minister for Armaments Albert Speer was entrusted with executing this scorched earth policy, but he secretly disobeyed the order.', u"On 20 April, his 56th birthday, Hitler made his last trip from the F\xfchrerbunker (F\xfchrer's shelter) to the surface.", u'In the ruined garden of the Reich Chancellery, he awarded Iron Crosses to boy soldiers of the Hitler Youth, who were now fighting the Red Army at the front near Berlin.', u"By 21 April, Georgy Zhukov's 1st Belorussian Front had broken through the defences of General Gotthard Heinrici's Army Group Vistula during the Battle of the Seelow Heights and advanced to the outskirts of Berlin.", u'In denial about the dire situation, Hitler placed his hopes on the undermanned and under-equipped Armeeabteilung Steiner (Army Detachment Steiner), commanded by Waffen SS General Felix Steiner.', u'Hitler ordered Steiner to attack the northern flank of the salient, while the German Ninth Army was ordered to attack northward in a pincer attack.', u"During a military conference on 22 April, Hitler asked about Steiner's offensive.", u'He was told that the attack had not been launched and that the Soviets had entered Berlin.', u'Hitler asked everyone except Wilhelm Keitel, Alfred Jodl, Hans Krebs, and Wilhelm Burgdorf to leave the room, then launched into a tirade against the treachery and incompetence of his commanders, culminating in his declaration\u2014for the first time\u2014that "everything was lost".', u'He announced that he would stay in Berlin until the end and then shoot himself.', u'By 23 April the Red Army had surrounded Berlin, and Goebbels made a proclamation urging its citizens to defend the city.', u'That same day, G\xf6ring sent a telegram from Berchtesgaden, arguing that since Hitler was isolated in Berlin, G\xf6ring should assume leadership of Germany.', u'G\xf6ring set a deadline, after which he would consider Hitler incapacitated.', u'Hitler responded by having G\xf6ring arrested, and in his last will and testament, written on 29 April, he removed G\xf6ring from all government positions.', u'On 28 April Hitler discovered that Himmler, who had left Berlin on 20 April, was trying to negotiate a surrender to the Western Allies.', u"He ordered Himmler's arrest and had Hermann Fegelein (Himmler's SS representative at Hitler's HQ in Berlin) shot.", u'After midnight on 29 April, Hitler married Eva Braun in a small civil ceremony in the F\xfchrerbunker.', u'After a wedding breakfast with his new wife, Hitler dictated his will to his secretary Traudl Junge.', u'The event was witnessed and documents signed by Krebs, Burgdorf, Goebbels, and Bormann.', u'Later that afternoon, Hitler was informed of the execution of Mussolini, which presumably increased his determination to avoid capture.', u'On 30 April 1945, when Soviet troops were within a block or two of the Reich Chancellery, Hitler shot himself and Braun bit into a cyanide capsule.', u'Their bodies were carried outside to the bombed-out garden behind the Reich Chancellery, where they were placed in a bomb crater and doused with petrol.', u'The corpses were set on fire as the Red Army shelling continued.', u"Grand Admiral Karl D\xf6nitz and Joseph Goebbels assumed Hitler's roles as head of state and chancellor respectively.", u'Berlin surrendered on 2 May.', u"Records in the Soviet archives obtained after the fall of the Soviet Union state that the remains of Hitler, Braun, Joseph and Magda Goebbels, the six Goebbels children, General Hans Krebs, and Hitler's dogs were repeatedly buried and exhumed.", u'On 4 April 1970, a Soviet KGB team used detailed burial charts to exhume five wooden boxes at the SMERSH facility in Magdeburg.', u'The remains from the boxes were burned, crushed, and scattered into the Biederitz river, a tributary of the Elbe.', u"According to Kershaw, the corpses of Braun and Hitler were fully burned when the Red Army found them, and only a lower jaw with dental work could be identified as Hitler's remains.", u'=== The Holocaust ===\n\nIf the international Jewish financiers in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war, then the result will not be the Bolshevisation of the earth, and thus the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe!', u"The Holocaust and Germany's war in the East were based on Hitler's long-standing view that the Jews were the enemy of the German people and that Lebensraum was needed for Germany's expansion.", u'He focused on Eastern Europe for this expansion, aiming to defeat Poland and the Soviet Union and then removing or killing the Jews and Slavs.', u'The Generalplan Ost (General Plan East) called for deporting the population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to West Siberia, for use as slave labour or to be murdered; the conquered territories were to be colonised by German or "Germanised" settlers.', u'The goal was to implement this plan after the conquest of the Soviet Union, but when this failed, Hitler moved the plans forward.', u'By January 1942, he had decided that the Jews, Slavs, and other deportees considered undesirable should be killed.', u'The genocide was ordered by Hitler and organised and executed by Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich.', u'The records of the Wannsee Conference, held on 20 January 1942 and led by Heydrich, with fifteen senior Nazi officials participating, provide the clearest evidence of systematic planning for the Holocaust.', u'On 22 February, Hitler was recorded saying, "we shall regain our health only by eliminating the Jews".', u'Although no direct order from Hitler authorising the mass killings has surfaced, his public speeches, orders to his generals, and the diaries of Nazi officials demonstrate that he conceived and authorised the extermination of European Jewry.', u'He approved the Einsatzgruppen\u2014killing squads that followed the German army through Poland, the Baltic, and the Soviet Union\u2014and was well informed about their activities.', u'By summer 1942, Auschwitz concentration camp was expanded to accommodate large numbers of deportees for killing or enslavement.', u'Scores of other concentration camps and satellite camps were set up throughout Europe, with several camps devoted exclusively to extermination.', u'Between 1939 and 1945, the Schutzstaffel (SS), assisted by collaborationist governments and recruits from occupied countries, was responsible for the deaths of at least eleven million people, including 5.5 to 6 million Jews (representing two-thirds of the Jewish population of Europe), and between 200,000 and 1,500,000 Romani people.', u'Deaths took place in concentration and extermination camps, ghettos, and through mass executions.', u'Many victims of the Holocaust were gassed to death, whereas others died of starvation or disease or while working as slave labourers.', u'In addition to eliminating Jews, the Nazis planned to reduce the population of the conquered territories by 30 million people through starvation in an action called the Hunger Plan.', u'Food supplies would be diverted to the German army and German civilians.', u'Cities would be razed and the land allowed to return to forest or resettled by German colonists.', u'Together, the Hunger Plan and Generalplan Ost would have led to the starvation of 80 million people in the Soviet Union.', u'These partially fulfilled plans resulted in the democidal deaths of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war.', u"Hitler's policies resulted in the killing of nearly two million Poles, over three million Soviet prisoners of war, communists and other political opponents, homosexuals, the physically and mentally disabled, Jehovah's Witnesses, Adventists, and trade unionists.", u'Hitler did not speak publicly about the killings, and seems never to have visited the concentration camps.', u'The Nazis embraced the concept of racial hygiene.', u'On 15 September 1935, Hitler presented two laws\u2014known as the Nuremberg Laws\u2014to the Reichstag.', u'The laws banned sexual relations and marriages between Aryans and Jews and were later extended to include "Gypsies, Negroes or their bastard offspring".', u'The laws stripped all non-Aryans of their German citizenship and forbade the employment of non-Jewish women under the age of 45 in Jewish households.', u"Hitler's early eugenic policies targeted children with physical and developmental disabilities in a programme dubbed Action Brandt, and he later authorised a euthanasia programme for adults with serious mental and physical disabilities, now referred to as Action T4.", u'== Leadership style ==\nHitler ruled the NSDAP autocratically by asserting the F\xfchrerprinzip (leader principle).', u'The principle relied on absolute obedience of all subordinates to their superiors; thus he viewed the government structure as a pyramid, with himself\u2014the infallible leader\u2014at the apex.', u'Rank in the party was not determined by elections\u2014positions were filled through appointment by those of higher rank, who demanded unquestioning obedience to the will of the leader.', u'Hitler\'s leadership style was to give contradictory orders to his subordinates and to place them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped with those of others, to have "the stronger one [do] the job".', u'In this way, Hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power.', u'His cabinet never met after 1938, and he discouraged his ministers from meeting independently.', u'Hitler typically did not give written orders; instead he communicated verbally, or had them conveyed through his close associate, Martin Bormann.', u'He entrusted Bormann with his paperwork, appointments, and personal finances; Bormann used his position to control the flow of information and access to Hitler.', u"Hitler dominated his country's war effort during World War II to a greater extent than any other national leader.", u"He assumed the role of supreme commander of the armed forces during 1938, and subsequently made all major decisions regarding Germany's military strategy.", u'His decision to mount a risky series of offensives against Norway, France, and the Low Countries in 1940 against the advice of the military proved successful, though the diplomatic and military strategies he employed in attempts to force the United Kingdom out of the war ended in failure.', u'Hitler deepened his involvement in the war effort by appointing himself commander-in-chief of the Army in December 1941; from this point forward he personally directed the war against the Soviet Union, while his military commanders facing the Western Allies retained a degree of autonomy.', u"Hitler's leadership became increasingly disconnected from reality as the war turned against Germany, with the military's defensive strategies often hindered by his slow decision making and frequent directives to hold untenable positions.", u'Nevertheless, he continued to believe that only his leadership could deliver victory.', u'In the final months of the war Hitler refused to consider peace negotiations, regarding the complete destruction of Germany as preferable to surrender.', u"The military did not challenge Hitler's dominance of the war effort, and senior officers generally supported and enacted his decisions.", u'== Legacy ==\n\nHitler\'s suicide was likened by contemporaries to a "spell" being broken.', u'Public support for Hitler had collapsed by the time of his death and few Germans mourned his passing; Kershaw argues that most civilians and military personnel were too busy adjusting to the collapse of the country or fleeing from the fighting to take any interest.', u'According to historian John Toland, National Socialism "burst like a bubble" without its leader.', u'Hitler\'s actions and Nazi ideology are almost universally regarded as gravely immoral; according to Kershaw, "Never in history has such ruination\u2014physical and moral\u2014been associated with the name of one man".', u"Hitler's political programme brought about a world war, leaving behind a devastated and impoverished Eastern and Central Europe.", u'Germany itself suffered wholesale destruction, characterised as Stunde Null (Zero Hour).', u"Hitler's policies inflicted human suffering on an unprecedented scale; according to R. J. Rummel, the Nazi regime was responsible for the democidal killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war.", u'In addition, 29 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European Theatre of World War II.', u'The number of civilians killed during the Second World War was unprecedented in the history of warfare.', u'Historians, philosophers, and politicians often use the word "evil" to describe the Nazi regime.', u'Many European countries have criminalised both the promotion of Nazism and Holocaust denial.', u'Historian Friedrich Meinecke described Hitler as "one of the great examples of the singular and incalculable power of personality in historical life".', u'English historian Hugh Trevor-Roper saw him as "among the \'terrible simplifiers\' of history, the most systematic, the most historical, the most philosophical, and yet the coarsest, cruelest, least magnanimous conqueror the world has ever known".', u"For the historian John M. Roberts, Hitler's defeat marked the end of a phase of European history dominated by Germany.", u'In its place emerged the Cold War, a global confrontation between the Western Bloc, dominated by the United States and other NATO nations, and the Eastern Bloc, dominated by the Soviet Union.', u'Historian Sebastian Haffner avers that without Hitler and the displacement of the Jews, the modern nation state of Israel would not exist.', u'He contends that without Hitler, the de-colonisation of former European spheres of influence would have been postponed.', u'Further, Haffner claims that other than Alexander the Great, Hitler had a more significant impact than any other comparable historical figure, in that he too caused a wide range of worldwide changes in a relatively short time span.', u'== Views on religion ==\n\nHitler was born to a practising Catholic mother and an anticlerical father; after leaving home Hitler never again attended Mass or received the sacraments.', u'Speer states that Hitler made harsh pronouncements against the church to his political associates and though he never officially left it, he had no attachment to it.', u'He adds that Hitler felt that in the absence of the church the faithful would turn to mysticism, which he considered a step backwards.', u'According to Speer, Hitler believed that either Japanese religious beliefs or Islam would have been a more suitable religion for the Germans than Christianity, with its "meekness and flabbiness".', u'Historian John S.

Pike's Peak was.", u"== Overview ==\n\nThe Pike's Peak Gold Rush, which followed the California Gold Rush by approximately one decade, produced a dramatic but temporary influx of immigrants into the Pike's Peak Country of the Southern Rocky Mountains.", u'The rush was exemplified by the slogan "Pike\'s Peak or Bust!', u'", a reference to the prominent mountain at the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains that guided many early prospectors to the region westward over the Great Plains.', u'The prospectors provided the first major European-American population in the region.', u'The rush created a few mining camps such as Denver City and Boulder City that would develop into cities.', u'Many smaller camps such as Auraria and Saint Charles City were absorbed by larger camps and towns.', u'Scores of other mining camps have faded into ghost towns, but quite a few camps such as Central City, Black Hawk, Georgetown, and Idaho Springs survive.', u'== Discovery ==\n\nFor many years people had suspected the mountains had numerous rich gold deposits.', u'In 1835, a French trapper by the name of Eustace Carriere had ended up losing his party and wandered through the mountains for many weeks.', u'During these weeks he found many gold specimens which he later took back to New Mexico for examination.', u'Upon examination, they turned out to be "pure gold".', u'But when he tried to lead an expedition back to the location of where he found the gold, they came up short because he could not quite remember the location.', u'In 1849 and 1850, several parties of gold seekers bound for the California Gold Rush panned small amounts of gold from various streams in the South Platte River valley at the foot of the Rocky Mountains.', u'The Rocky Mountain gold failed to impress or delay men with visions of unlimited wealth in California, and the discoveries were not reported for several years.', u'As the hysteria of the California Gold Rush faded, many discouraged gold seekers returned home.', u'Rumors of gold in the Rocky Mountains persisted and several small parties explored the region.', u'In the summer of 1857, a party of Spanish-speaking gold seekers from New Mexico worked a placer deposit along the South Platte River about 5 miles (8 kilometers) above Cherry Creek in what is today Denver.', u'William Greeneberry "Green" Russell was a Georgian who worked in the California gold fields in the 1850s.', u'Russell was married to a Cherokee woman, and through his connections to the tribe, he heard about an 1849 discovery of gold along the South Platte River.',

u'They began prospecting in the river beds, exploring Cherry Creek and nearby Ralston Creek but without success.', u'In the first week of July 1858, Green Russell and Sam Bates found a small placer deposit near the mouth of Little Dry Creek that yielded about 20 troy ounces (622 grams) of gold, the first significant gold discovery in the Rocky Mountain region.', u'The site of the discovery is in the present-day Denver suburb of Englewood, just north of the junction of U.S. Highway 285 and U.S. Highway 85.', u'== The initial boom ==\n\nThe first decade of the boom was largely concentrated along the South Platte River at the base of the mountains, the canyon of Clear Creek in the mountains west of Golden City, at Breckenridge and in South Park at Como, Fairplay, and Alma.', u'By 1860, Denver City, Golden City, and Boulder City were substantial towns serving the mines.', u'Rapid population growth led to the creation of the Colorado Territory in 1861.', u"The Pike's Peak Gold Rush

start, only to realize that they would have to wait until the snow melted to even begin their mining for gold.', u'=== Free gold ===\n\nHardrock mining boomed for a few years, but then declined in the mid-1860s as the miners exhausted the shallow parts of the veins that contained free gold, and found that their amalgamation mills could not recover gold from the deeper sulfide ores.', u'This problem

{'sentences': [u'A senate is a deliberative assembly, often the upper house or chamber of a bicameral legislature or parliament.', u'The name comes from the ancient Roman Senate (Latin: Senatus), so-called as an assembly of the senior (Latin: senex meaning "the elder" or "the old one") and therefore allegedly wiser and more experienced members of the society or ruling class.', u'Thus, the literal meaning of the word "senate" is: Assembly of Elders.', u'Many countries have an assembly named a senate, composed of senators who may be elected, appointed, have inherited the title, or gained membership by other methods, depending on the country.', u'Modern senates typically serve to provide a chamber of "sober second thought" to consider legislation passed by a lower house, whose members are usually elected.', u'== Overview ==\nThe modern word Senate is derived from the [Latin] word sen\u0101tus (senate), which comes from senex, \u201cold man\u201d.', u'The members or legislators of a senate are called senators.', u'The Latin word senator was adopted into English with no change in spelling.', u'Its meaning is derived from a very ancient form of social organization, in which advisory or decision-making powers are reserved for the eldest men.', u'For the same reason, the word senate is correctly used when referring to any powerful authority characteristically composed by the eldest members of a community, as a deliberative body of a faculty in an institution of higher learning is often called a senate.', u'This form adaptation was used to show the power of those in body and for the decision-making process to be thorough, which could take a long period of time.', u'The original senate was the Roman Senate, which lasted until 580 (various efforts to revive it were made in Medieval Rome).', u'In the Eastern Roman Empire, the Byzantine Senate continued until the Fourth Crusade, circa 1202\u20131204.', u'Modern democratic states with bicameral parliamentary systems are sometimes equipped with a senate, often distinguished from an ordinary parallel lower house, known variously as the \u201cHouse of Representatives\u201d, \u201cHouse of Commons\u201d, \u201cChamber of Deputies\u201d, \u201cNational Assembly\u201d, \u201cLegislative Assembly\u201d, or "House of Assembly", by electoral rules.', u'This may include minimum age required for voters and candidates, proportional or majoritarian or plurality system, and an electoral basis or collegium.', u'Typically, the senate is referred to as the upper house and has a smaller membership than the lower house.', u'In some federal states senates also exist at the subnational level.', u'In the United States all states with the exception of Nebraska (whose legislature is a unicameral body called the \u201cLegislature\u201d but whose members refer to themselves as \u201csenators\u201d) have a state senate.', u'There is also the US Senate at the federal level.', u"Similarly in Argentina, in addition to the Senate at federal level, eight of the country's provinces, Buenos Aires, Catamarca, Corrientes, Entre R\xedos, Mendoza, Salta, San Luis (since 1987) and Santa Fe, have bicameral legislatures with a Senate.", u'C\xf3rdoba and Tucum\xe1n changed to unicameral systems in 2001 and 2003 respectively.', u'In Australia and Canada, only the upper house of the federal parliament is known as the Senate.', u'All states other than Queensland have an upper house known as a Legislative council.', u"Several Canadian provinces also once had a Legislative Council, but these have all been abolished, the last being Quebec's Legislative council in 1968.", u'In Germany, the last Senate of a State parliament, the Senate of Bavaria, was abolished in 1999.', u'Senate membership can be determined either through elections or appointments.', u'For example, elections are held every three years for half the membership of the Australian Senate, the term of a senator being six years.', u'In contrast, members of the Canadian Senate are appointed by the Governor General upon the recommendation of the Prime Minister of Canada, holding the office until they resign, are removed, or retire at the mandatory age of 75.', u'== Alternative meanings ==\nThe terms Senate and Senator, however, do not necessarily refer to a second chamber of a legislature:\nThe Senate of Finland was, until 1919, the executive branch and the supreme court.', u'The Senate of Latvia (lv) fulfilled a similar judicial function during the interbellum (1918-1940).', u'In German politics:\nIn the Bundesl\xe4nder (Federated States) of Germany which form a City State (in German: Stadtstaat), i.e.', u'Berlin (Senate of Berlin), Bremen (Senate of Bremen) and Hamburg (Senate of Hamburg), the Senates (Senat in German) are the executive branch, with Senator (Senator) being the holders of ministerial portfolios.', u'In a number of cities which were former members of the Hanse (a medieval confederacy of port cities mainly at the shores of the Baltic Sea and the North Sea), such as Greifswald, L\xfcbeck, Rostock, Stralsund, or Wismar, the city government is also called a Senate.', u'However, in Bavaria, the Senate was a second legislative chamber until its abolition in 1999.', u'In German jurisdiction:\nThe term Senat (senate) in higher courts of appeal refers to the "bench" in its broader metonymy meaning, describing members of the judiciary collectively (usually five judges), often occupied with a particular subject-matter jurisdiction.', u'However, the judges are not called "senators".', u'The German term Strafsenat (literally "Penal Senate") in a German court translates to Bench of penal-law jurisdiction and Zivilsenat (literally "Civil Senate") to Bench of private-law jurisdiction.', u'The Federal Constitutional Court of Germany consists of two senates of eight judges each.', u'In its case the division is mostly of an organizational nature, as a matter of dividing the work load; both senates handle the same kind of constitutional cases.', u'At some points in the past, one senate was considered more conservative and the other more liberal, but that is not the case as of 2011.', u'In Scotland, judges of the High Court of Justiciary are called Senators of the College of Justice.', u'In some, mostly federal countries with a unicameral legislature, some of the legislators are elected differently from the others and are called Senators.', u'In federal countries, such Senators represent the territories, while the other members represent the people at large (this device is used to allow a federal representation without having to establish a bicameral legislature); this is the case with St. Kitts and Nevis, Comoros and Micronesia.', u"In other, non-federal countries, the use of the term Senator marks some other difference between such members and the rest of the legislators (such as the method of selection); this is the case with the States of Jersey, Dominica's House of Assembly and the Saint Vincent House of Assembly.", u"In Wales, the National Assembly for Wales debating chamber is called the Senedd, pronounced 'Seneth'.", u'An academic senate is the governing body of some universities.', u'In Greece during the early stages of the Greek War of Independence, various local legislative and executive bodies were established by

Ferguson (1896) doctrine of separate but equal in interstate bus travel.', u'The ICC failed to enforce its ruling, and Jim Crow travel laws remained in force throughout the South.', u'The Freedom Riders challenged this status quo by riding interstate buses in the South in mixed racial groups to challenge local laws or customs that enforced segregation in seating.', u'The Freedom Rides, and the violent reactions they provoked, bolstered the credibility of the American Civil Rights Movement.', u'They called national attention to the disregard for the federal law and the local violence used to enforce segregation in the southern United States.', u'Police arrested riders for trespassing, unlawful assembly, and violating state and local Jim Crow laws, along with other alleged offenses, but they often first let white mobs attack them without intervention.', u'The Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) sponsored most of the subsequent Freedom Rides, but some were also organized by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).', u'The Freedom Rides followed dramatic sit-ins against segregated lunch counters, conducted by students and youth throughout the South, and boycotts of retail establishments that maintained segregated facilities, beginning in 1960.', u"The Supreme Court's decision in Boynton supported the right of interstate travelers to disregard local segregation ordinances.", u'Southern local and state police considered the actions of the Freedom Riders as criminal and arrested them in some locations.', u'In some localities, such as Birmingham, Alabama, the police cooperated with Ku Klux Klan chapters and other whites opposing the actions and allowed mobs to attack the riders.', u'== History ==\n\n\n=== Starting point ===\nThe Freedom Riders were inspired by the 1947 Journey of Reconciliation, led by Bayard Rustin and George Houser and co-sponsored by the Fellowship of Reconciliation and the then-fledgling Congress of Racial Equality (CORE).', u'Like the Freedom Rides of 1961, the Journey of Reconciliation was intended to test an earlier Supreme Court ruling that banned racial discrimination in interstate travel.', u'Rustin, Igal Roodenko, Joe Felmet and Andrew Johnnson, were arrested and sentenced to serve on a chain gang in North Carolina for violating local Jim Crow laws regarding segregated seating on public transportation.', u'The first Freedom Ride began on May 4, 1961.', u'Led by CORE Director James Farmer, 13 riders (seven black, six white, including Genevieve Hughes, William E. Harbour, and Ed Blankenheim) left Washington, DC, on Greyhound and Trailways buses.', u'Their plan was to ride through Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, ending in New Orleans, Louisiana, where a civil rights rally was planned.', u'Most of the Riders were from CORE, and two were from SNCC.', u'Many were in their 40s and 50s.', u'Some were as young as 18.', u"The Freedom Riders' tactics for their journey were to have at least one interracial pair sitting in adjoining seats, and at least one black rider sitting up front, where seats under segregation had been reserved for white customers by local custom throughout the South.", u'The rest of the team would sit scattered throughout the rest of the bus.', u"One rider would abide by the South's segregation rules in order to avoid arrest and to contact CORE and arrange bail for those who were arrested.", u'Only minor trouble was encountered in Virginia and North Carolina, but John Lewis was attacked in Rock Hill, South Carolina.', u'Some of the Riders were arrested in Charlotte, North Carolina; Winnsboro, South Carolina; and Jackson, Mississippi.', u'=== Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham ===\nThe Birmingham, Alabama, Police Commissioner, Bull Connor, together with Police Sergeant Tom Cook (an avid Ku Klux Klan supporter), organized violence against the Freedom Riders with local Ku Klux Klan chapters.', u'The pair made plans to bring the Ride to an end in Alabama.', u'They assured Gary Thomas Rowe, an FBI informer and member of Eastview Klavern #13 (the most violent Klan group in Alabama), that the mob would have fifteen minutes to attack the Freedom Riders without any arrests being made.', u'The plan was to allow an initial assault in Anniston with a final assault taking place in Birmingham.', u"On May 14, Mother's Day, in Anniston, a mob of Ku Klux Klansmen, some still in church attire, attacked the first of the two buses (the Greyhound).", u'The driver tried to leave the station, but was blocked until KKK members slashed its tires.', u'The mob forced the crippled bus to stop several miles outside of town and then firebombed it.', u'As the bus burned, the mob held the doors shut, intending to burn the riders to death.', u'Sources disagree, but either an exploding fuel tank or an undercover state investigator brandishing a revolver caused the mob to retreat, and the riders escaped the bus.', u'The mob beat the riders after they escaped the bus.', u'Only warning shots fired into the air by highway patrolmen prevented the riders from being lynched.', u'That night, the hospitalized Freedom Riders, most of whom had been refused care, were removed from the hospital at 2 AM, because the staff feared the mob outside the hospital.', u'The local civil rights leader Rev.', u'Fred Shuttlesworth organized several cars of blacks to rescue the injured Freedom Riders in defiance of the white supremacists.', u'The blacks were under the leadership of Colonel Stone Johnson and were openly armed as they arrived at the hospital, protecting the Freedom Riders from the mob.', u'When the Trailways bus reached Anniston and pulled in at the terminal an hour after the Greyhound bus was burned, it was boarded by eight Klansmen.', u'They beat the Freedom Riders and left them semi-conscious in the back of the bus.', u'When the bus arrived in Birmingham, it was attacked by a mob of KKK members aided and abetted by police under the orders of Commissioner Bull Connor.', u'As the riders exited the bus, they were beaten by the mob with baseball bats, iron pipes and bicycle chains.', u'Among the attacking Klansmen was Gary Thomas Rowe, an FBI informant.', u'White Freedom Riders were singled out for especially frenzied beatings; James Peck required more than 50 stitches to the wounds in his head.', u'Peck was taken to Carraway Methodist Medical Center, which refused to treat him; he was later treated at Jefferson Hillman Hospital.', u'When reports of the bus burning and beatings reached US Attorney General Robert Kennedy, he urged restraint on the part of Freedom Riders.', u'He sent an assistant, John Seigenthaler, to Alabama to try to calm the situation.', u'Despite the violence suffered and the threat of more to come, the Freedom Riders wanted to continue their journey.', u'Kennedy had arranged an escort for the Riders in order to get them to Montgomery, Alabama, safely.', u'However, radio reports told of the mob awaiting the riders at the bus terminal, as well as on the route to Montgomery.', u'The Greyhound clerks told the Riders that their drivers were refusing to drive any Freedom Riders anywhere.', u'Recognizing that their efforts had already called national attention to the civil rights cause and wanting to make the rally in New Orleans, the Riders decided to abandon the rest of the bus ride and fly directly to New Orleans from Birmingham.', u'When they first boarded the plane, all passengers had to exit because of a bomb threat.', u'Diane Nash, a Nashville college student and SNCC leader, believed that if Southern violence were allowed to halt the Freedom Rides, the movement would be set back years.', u'She pushed to find replacements to resume the rides.', u'On May 17, a new set of riders, 10 students from Nashville, took a bus to Birmingham, where they were arrested by Bull Connor and jailed.', u'These students kept their spirits up in jail by singing freedom songs.', u'Out of frustration, Connor drove them back up to the Tennessee line and dropped them off, saying, "I just couldn\'t stand their singing."', u'They immediately returned to Birmingham.', u"=== Mob violence in Montgomery ===\nIn answer to SNCC's call, Freedom Riders from across the Eastern US joined John Lewis and Hank Thomas, the two young SNCC members of the original Ride, who had remained in Birmingham.", u'On May 19, they attempted to resume the ride, but, terrified by the howling mob surrounding the bus depot, the drivers refused.', u'Harassed and besieged by the mob, the riders waited all night for a bus.', u'Under intense public pressure from the Kennedy administration, Greyhound was forced to provide a driver.', u"After direct intervention by Byron White of the Attorney General's office, Alabama Governor John Patterson reluctantly promised to protect the bus from KKK mobs and snipers on the road between Birmingham and Montgomery.", u'On the morning of May 20, the Freedom Ride resumed, with the bus carrying the riders traveling toward Montgomery at 90 miles an hour, protected by a contingent of the Alabama State Highway Patrol.', u'The Highway Patrol abandoned the bus and riders at the Montgomery city limits.', u'At the bus station on South Court Street, a white mob awaited.', u'They beat the Freedom Riders with baseball bats and iron pipes.', u'The local police allowed the beatings to go on uninterrupted.', u'Again, white Freedom Riders were singled out for particularly brutal beatings.', u'Reporters and news photographers were attacked first and their cameras destroyed, but one reporter took a photo later of Jim Zwerg in the hospital, showing how he was beaten and bruised.', u'Seigenthaler, a Justice Department official, was beaten and left unconscious lying in the street.', u'Ambulances refused to take the wounded to the hospital.', u'Local blacks rescued them, and a number of the Freedom Riders were hospitalized.', u"On the following night, Sunday, May 21, more than 1500 people packed Reverend Ralph Abernathy's First Baptist Church to honor the Freedom Riders.", u'Among the speakers were Rev.', u'Martin Luther King, Jr., who was newly based in Montgomery, Rev.', u'Fred Shuttlesworth, and James Farmer.', u'Outside, a mob of more than 3,000 whites attacked blacks, with a handful of the United States Marshals Service protecting the church from assault and fire bombs.', u'With city and state police making no effort to restore order, the civil rights leaders appealed to the President for protection.', u'President Kennedy threatened the governor to intervene with federal troops if he would not protect the people.', u'Governor Patterson forestalled that by finally ordering the Alabama National Guard to disperse the mob, and the Guard reached the church in the early morning.', u'In a commemorative Op-Ed piece in 2011, Bernard Lafayette remembered the mob breaking windows of the church with rocks and setting off tear gas canisters.', u'He recounted heroic action by King.', u'After learning that black taxi drivers were arming and forming a group to rescue the people inside, he worried that more violence would result.', u'He selected ten volunteers, who promised non-violence, to escort him through the white mob, which parted to let King and his escorts pass as they marched two by two.', u'King went out to the black drivers and asked them to disperse, to prevent more violence.', u'King and his escorts formally made their way back inside the church, unmolested.', u'Lafayette also was interviewed by BBC in 2011 and told about these events in an episode broadcast on radio 31 August 2011 in commemoration of the Freedom Rides.', u'The Alabama National Guard finally arrived in the early morning to disperse the mob and safely escorted all the people from the church.', u'=== Into Mississippi ===\n\nThe next day, Monday, May 22, more Freedom Riders from Congress of Racial Equality and Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee arrived in Montgomery to continue the rides through the South and replace the wounded riders still in the hospital.', u'Behind the scenes, the Kennedy administration arranged a deal with the governors of Alabama and Mississippi.', u'The governors agreed that state police and the National Guard would protect the Riders from mob violence.', u'In return, the federal government would not intervene to stop local police from arresting Freedom Riders for violating segregation ordinances when the buses arrived at the depots.', u'On Wednesday morning, May 24, Freedom Riders boarded buses for the journey to Jackson, Mississippi.', u'Surrounded by Highway Patrol and the National Guard, the buses arrived in Jackson without incident.', u'The riders were immediately arrested when they tried to use the white-only facilities at the depot.', u'In Montgomery, the next round of Freedom Riders, including the Yale University chaplain William Sloane Coffin, Gaylord Brewster Noyce, and southern ministers Shuttlesworth, Abernathy, Wyatt Tee Walker, and others were similarly arrested for violating local segregation ordinances.', u'This established a pattern followed by subsequent Freedom Rides, most of which traveled to Jackson, where they were arrested and jailed.', u"The Riders' strategy became one of trying to fill the jails.", u'Once the Jackson and Hinds County jails were filled to overflowing, the state transferred the Freedom Riders to the infamous Mississippi State Penitentiary (known as Parchman Farm).', u'Abusive treatment there included placement of Riders in the Maximum Security Unit (Death Row), issuance of only underwear, no exercise, and no mail.', u'When the Freedom Riders refused to stop singing freedom songs, prison officials took away their mattresses, sheets, and toothbrushes.', u'More Freedom Riders arrived from across the country, and at one time, more than 300 were held in Parchman Farm.', u'=== Kennedy urges "cooling off period" ===\nThe Kennedys called for a "cooling off period" and condemned the Rides as unpatriotic because they embarrassed the nation on the world stage at the height of the Cold War.', u'The Soviet Union criticized the United States for its racism and the attacks on the riders.', u'Attorney General Robert Kennedy, the chief law-enforcement officer of the land, was quoted as saying that he "does not feel that the Department of Justice can side with one group or the other in disputes over Constitutional rights."', u'His comment angered civil rights supporters, who considered the Justice Department duty-bound to enforce Supreme Court rulings and defend citizens exercising their Constitutional rights from mob violence.', u'Nonetheless, international outrage about the widely covered events and racial violence created pressure on United States political leaders.', u'On May 29, 1961, Attorney General Kennedy sent a petition to the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) asking it to comply with the bus-desegregation ruling it had issued in November 1955, in Sarah Keys v. Carolina Coach Company.', u'That ruling had explicitly repudiated separate but equal in the realm of interstate bus travel.', u'Chaired by the South Carolina Democrat J. Monroe Johnson, the ICC had failed to implement its own ruling.', u'James Farmer, head of CORE, responded to Kennedy saying, "We have been cooling off for 350 years, and if we cooled off any more, we\'d be in a deep freeze."', u'=== Summer escalation ===\n\nCORE, SNCC, and the SCLC rejected any "cooling off period".', u'They formed a Freedom Riders Coordinating Committee to keep the Rides rolling through June, July, August, and September.', u'During those months, more than 60 different Freedom Rides criss-crossed the South, most of them converging on Jackson, where every rider was arrested, more than 300 in total.', u'An unknown number of riders were arrested in other Southern towns.', u'It is estimated that almost 450 riders participated in one or more Freedom Rides.', u'About 75% were male, and the same percentage were under the age of 30, with about equal participation from blacks and whites.', u'During the summer of 1961, Freedom Riders also campaigned against other forms of racial discrimination.', u'They sat together in segregated restaurants, lunch counters and hotels.', u'This was especially effective when they targeted large companies, such as hotel chains.', u'Fearing boycotts in the North, the hotels began to desegregate their businesses.', u'In mid-June, a group of Freedom Riders had scheduled to end their ride in Tallahassee, Florida, with plans to fly home from the Tallahassee airport.', u"They were provided a police escort to the airport from the city's bus facilities.", u'At the airport, they decided to eat at a restaurant that was marked "For Whites Only".', u'The owners decided to close rather than serve the mixed group of Freedom Riders.', u'Although the restaurant was privately owned, it was leased from the county government.', u'Canceling their plane reservations, the Riders decided to wait until the restaurant re-opened so they could be served.', u'They waited until 11:00 pm that night and returned the following day.', u'During this time, hostile crowds gathered, threatening violence.', u'On June 16, 1961, the Freedom Riders were arrested in Tallahassee for unlawful assembly.', u'That arrest and subsequent trial became known as Dresner v. City of Tallahassee.', u'Convictions of the Riders were appealed to the US Supreme Court in 1963, which refused to hear the case based on technical reasons.', u'=== Monroe and Robert F. Williams ===\nIn early August, SNCC staff members James Forman and Paul Brooks, with the support of Ella Baker, began planning a Freedom Ride in solidarity with Robert F. Williams.', u'Williams was an extremely militant and controversial NAACP chapter president for Monroe, North Carolina.', u'After making the public statement that he would "meet violence with violence," (since the federal government would not protect his community from racial attacks) he had been suspended by the NAACP national board over the objections of Williams\' local membership.', u'Williams continued his work against segregation however, and was facing repeated attempts on his life because of it.', u"Some SNCC staff members sympathized with the local community's proclivity for armed self-defense, although many on the ride to Monroe saw this as an opportunity to prove the superiority of Gandhian nonviolence over the use of force.", u'The Freedom Riders in Monroe were brutally attacked by white supremacists with the approval of local police.', u"On August 27, James Forman - SNCC's Executive Secretary - was struck unconscious with the butt of a rifle and taken to jail with numerous other demonstrators.", u'Police and civilian white supremacists roamed the town shooting at blacks, who returned the gunfire.', u'Robert F. Williams fortified the black neighborhood against attack and in the process briefly detained a white couple who had gotten lost there.', u'The police accused Williams of kidnapping and called in the state milita and FBI to arrest him, in spite of the couple being quickly released.', u'Certain he would be lynched, Williams fled and eventually found refuge in Cuba.', u'Movement lawyers, eager to disengage from the situation, successfully urged the Freedom Riders not to practice the normal "jail-no bail" strategy in Monroe.', u'Local officials, also apparently eager to de-escalate, found demonstrators guilty but immediately suspended their sentences.', u'One Freedom Rider however, John Lowry, went on trial for the kidnapping case, along with several associates of Robert F. Williams, including Mae Mallory.', u'Monroe legal defense committees were popular around the country, but ultimately Lowry and Mallory served prison sentences.', u'In 1965, their convictions were vacated due to the exclusion of blacks from the jury selection.', u'=== Resolution and legacy ===\nBy September it had been over three months since the filing of the petition by Robert Kennedy.', u'CORE and SNCC leaders made tentative plans for a mass demonstration known as the "Washington Project".', u'This would mobilize hundreds, perhaps thousands, of nonviolent demonstrators to the capital city to apply pressure on the ICC and the Kennedy administration.', u'The idea was pre-empted when the ICC finally issued the necessary orders just before the end of the month.', u'The new policies went into effect on November 1, 1961, six years after the ruling in Sarah Keys v. Carolina Coach Company.', u'After the new ICC rule took effect, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they pleased on interstate buses and trains; "white" and "colored" signs were removed from the terminals; racially segregated drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms serving interstate customers were consolidated; and the lunch counters began serving all customers, regardless of race.', u'The widespread violence provoked by the Freedom Rides sent shock waves through American society.', u'People worried that the Rides were evoking widespread social disorder and racial divergence, an opinion supported and strengthened in many communities by the press.', u'The press in white communities condemned the direct action approach that CORE was taking, while some of the national press negatively portrayed the Riders as provoking unrest.', u'At the same time, the Freedom Rides established great credibility with blacks and whites throughout the United States and inspired many people to engage in direct action for civil rights.', u'Perhaps most significantly, the actions of the Freedom Riders from the North, who faced danger on behalf of southern blacks, impressed and inspired the many blacks living in rural areas throughout the South.', u'They formed the backbone of the wider civil rights movement, who engaged in voter registration and other activities.', u'Southern blacks generally organized around their churches, the center of their communities and a base of moral strength.', u'The Freedom Riders helped inspire participation in other subsequent civil rights campaigns, including voter registration throughout the South, freedom schools, and the Black Power movement.', u'At the time, most blacks in southern states had been unable to register to vote, due to constitutions, laws and practices that had effectively disfranchised most of them since the turn of the 20th century.', u'For instance, white administrators supervised reading comprehension and literacy tests that highly educated blacks could not pass.', u'== List of Freedom Rides ==\n\n\n=== Precursors to Freedom Rides ===\n\n\n=== Original and subsequent Freedom Rides ===\n\n\n=== Mississippi Freedom Rides ===\n\n\n== Commemorations ==\n\nIn celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Freedom Rides, Oprah Winfrey invited all living Freedom Riders to join her TV program to celebrate their legacy.', u'The episode aired on May 4, 2011.', u'On May 6\u201316, 2011, 40 college students from across the United States embarked on a bus ride from Washington, D.C. to New Orleans, retracing the original route of the Freedom Riders.', u'The 2011 Student Freedom Ride, which was sponsored by PBS and American Experience, commemorated the 50th anniversary of the original Freedom Rides.', u'Students met with civil rights leaders along the way and traveled with original Freedom Riders such as Ernest "Rip" Patton, Joan Mulholland, Bob Singleton, Helen Singleton, Jim Zwerg, and Charles Person.', u'On May 16, 2011, PBS aired a documentary called Freedom Riders.', u'On May 19\u201321, 2011, the Freedom Rides were commemorated in Montgomery, Alabama, at the new Freedom Ride museum in the old Greyhound Bus terminal, where some of the violence had taken place in 1961.', u'On May 22\u201326, 2011, the arrival of the Freedom Rides in Jackson, Mississippi was commemorated with a 50th Anniversary Reunion and Conference in the city.', u'During commemorative events in February 2013 in Montgomery, Congressman John Lewis accepted the apologies of Chief Kevin Murphy of the Montgomery Police Department; Murphy gave Lewis his own badge, off his uniform, moving Lewis to tears.', u'In late 2011, Palestinian activists, inspired by the freedom riders, used the same methods in Israel by boarding a bus from which they were excluded.', u'Dan Shore\'s 2013 opera "Freedom Ride," set in New Orleans, celebrates the Freedom Riders.', u'== Notable Freedom Riders ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n"He Was My Brother", a Simon & Garfunkel song about the Freedom Riders\nReverse freedom rides\nFreedom Ride (Australia)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Scholarly works ===\nArsenault, Raymond (2006).', u'Freedom Riders: 1961 and the Struggle for Racial Justice.', u'Oxford University Press.', u'ISBN 9780199755813.', u'Barnes, Catherine A.', u'(1983).', u'Journey from Jim Crow: The Desegregation of Southern Transit.', u'Columbia University Press.', u'ISBN 9780231053808.', u'Branch, Taylor (2007).', u'Parting the Waters: America in the King Years 1954-63.', u'Simon and Schuster.', u'ISBN 9781416558682.', u'Catsam, Derek (2009).', u"Freedom's Main Line: The Journey of Reconciliation and the Freedom Rides.", u'University Press of Kentucky.', u'ISBN 9780813173108.', u'Etheridge, Eric;

originates from the Latin patere, which means "to lay open" (i.e., to make available for public inspection).', u'More directly, it is a shortened version of the term letters patent, which was a royal decree granting exclusive rights to a person, predating the modern patent system.', u'Similar grants included land patents, which were land grants by early state governments in the USA, and printing patents, a precursor of modern copyright.', u'In modern usage, the term patent usually refers to the right granted to anyone who invents any new, useful, and non-obvious process, machine, article of manufacture, or composition of matter.', u"Some other types of intellectual property rights are also called patents in some jurisdictions: industrial design rights are called design patents in the US, plant breeders' rights are sometimes called plant patents, and utility models and Gebrauchsmuster are sometimes called petty patents or innovation patents.", u'The additional qualification utility patent is sometimes used (primarily in the US) to distinguish the primary meaning from these other types of patents.', u'Particular species of patents for inventions include biological patents, business method patents, chemical patents and software patents.', u'== History ==\n\nAlthough there is some evidence that some form of patent rights was recognized in Ancient Greece in the Greek city of Sybaris, the first statutory patent system is generally regarded to be the Venetian Patent Statute of 1450.', u'Patents were systematically granted in Venice as of 1450, where they issued a decree by which new and inventive devices had to be communicated to the Republic in order to obtain legal protection against potential infringers.', u'The period of protection was 10 years.', u'These were mostly in the field of glass making.', u'As Venetians emigrated, they sought similar patent protection in their new homes.', u'This led to the diffusion of patent systems to other countries.', u'The English patent system evolved from its early medieval origins into the first modern patent system that recognised intellectual property in order to stimulate invention; this was the crucial legal foundation upon which the Industrial Revolution could emerge and flourish.', u'By the 16th century, the English Crown would habitually abuse the granting of letters patent for monopolies.', u'After public outcry, King James I of England (VI of Scotland) was forced to revoke all existing monopolies and declare that they were only to be used for "projects of new invention".', u"This was incorporated into the Statute of Monopolies (1624) in which Parliament restricted the Crown's power explicitly so that the King could only issue letters patent to the inventors or introducers of original inventions for a fixed number of years.", u'The Statute became the foundation for later developments in patent law in England and elsewhere.', u'Important developments in patent law emerged during the 18th century through a slow process of judicial interpretation of the law.', u'During the reign of Queen Anne, patent applications were required to supply a complete specification of the principles of operation of the invention for public access.', u'Legal battles around the 1796 patent taken out by James Watt for his steam engine, established the principles that patents could be issued for improvements of an already existing machine and that ideas or principles without specific practical application could also legally be patented.', u'Influenced by the philosophy of John Locke, the granting of patents began to be viewed as a form of intellectual property right, rather than simply the obtaining of economic privilege.', u'The English legal system became the foundation for patent law in countries with a common law heritage, including the United States, New Zealand and Australia.', u"In the Thirteen Colonies, inventors could obtain patents through petition to a given colony's legislature.", u'In 1641, Samuel Winslow was granted the first patent in North America by the Massachusetts General Court for a new process for making salt.', u'The modern French patent system was created during the Revolution in 1791.', u"Patents were granted without examination since inventor's right was considered as a natural one.", u'Patent costs were very high (from 500 to 1,500 francs).', u'Importation patents protected new devices coming from foreign countries.', u'The patent law was revised in 1844 - patent cost was lowered and importation patents were abolished.', u'The first Patent Act of the U.S. Congress was passed on April 10, 1790, titled "An Act to promote the progress of useful Arts".', u'The first patent was granted on July 31, 1790 to Samuel Hopkins for a method of producing potash (potassium carbonate).', u'== Law ==\n\n\n=== Effects ===\nA patent does not give a right to make or use or sell an invention.', u'Rather, a patent provides, from a legal standpoint, the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the patented invention for the term of the patent, which is usually 20 years from the filing date subject to the payment of maintenance fees.', u'From an economic and practical standpoint however, a patent is better and perhaps more precisely regarded as conferring upon its proprietor "a right to try to exclude by asserting the patent in court", for many granted patents turn out to be invalid once their proprietors attempt to assert them in court.', u'A patent is a limited property right the government gives inventors in exchange for their agreement to share details of their inventions with the public.', u'Like any other property right, it may be sold, licensed, mortgaged, assigned or transferred, given away, or simply abandoned.', u'A patent, being an exclusionary right, does not necessarily give the patent owner the right to exploit the invention subject to the patent.', u"For example, many inventions are improvements of prior inventions that may still be covered by someone else's patent.", u'If an inventor obtains a patent on improvements to an existing invention which is still under patent, they can only legally use the improved invention if the patent holder of the original invention gives permission, which they may refuse.', u'Some countries have "working provisions" that require the invention be exploited in the jurisdiction it covers.', u'Consequences of not working an invention vary from one country to another, ranging from revocation of the patent rights to the awarding of a compulsory license awarded by the courts to a party wishing to exploit a patented invention.', u'The patentee has the opportunity to challenge the revocation or license, but is usually required to provide evidence that the reasonable requirements of the public have been met by the working of invention.', u'=== Challenges ===\n In most jurisdictions, there are ways for third parties to challenge the validity of an allowed or issued patent at the national patent office; these are called opposition proceedings.', u'It is also possible to challenge the validity of a patent in court.', u'In either case, the challenging party tries to prove that the patent should never have been granted.', u'There are several grounds for challenges: the claimed subject matter is not patentable subject matter at all; the claimed subject matter was actually not new, or was obvious to experts in the field, at the time the application was filed; or that the some kind of fraud was committed during prosecution with regard to listing of inventors, representations about when discoveries were made, etc.', u'Patents can be found to be invalid in whole or in part for any of these reasons.', u'=== Infringement ===\n\nPatent infringement occurs when a third party, without authorization from the patentee, makes, uses, or sells a patented invention.', u'Patents, however, are enforced on a nation by nation basis.', u'The making of an item in China, for example, that would infringe a U.S. patent, would not constitute infringement under US patent law unless the item were imported into the US.', u'=== Enforcement ===\nPatents can generally only be enforced through civil lawsuits (for example, for a U.S. patent, by an action for patent infringement in a United States federal court), although some countries (such as France and Austria) have criminal penalties for wanton infringement.', u'Typically, the patent owner seeks monetary compensation for past infringement, and seeks an injunction that prohibits the defendant from engaging in future acts of infringement.', u'To prove infringement, the patent owner must establish that the accused infringer practises all the requirements of at least one of the claims of the patent.', u'(In many jurisdictions the scope of the patent may not be limited to what is literally stated in the claims, for example due to the doctrine of equivalents).', u'An accused infringer has the right to challenge the validity of the patent allegedly being infringed in a countersuit.', u'A patent can be found invalid on grounds described in the relevant patent laws, which vary between countries.', u'Often, the grounds are a subset of requirements for patentability in the relevant country.', u'Although an infringer is generally free to rely on any available ground of invalidity (such as a prior publication, for example), some countries have sanctions to prevent the same validity questions being relitigated.', u'An example is the UK Certificate of contested validity.', u'Patent licensing agreements are contracts in which the patent owner (the licensor) agrees to grant the licensee the right to make, use, sell, and/or import the claimed invention, usually in return for a royalty or other compensation.', u'It is common for companies engaged in complex technical fields to enter into multiple license agreements associated with the production of a single product.', u"Moreover, it is equally common for competitors in such fields to license patents to each other under cross-licensing agreements in order to share the benefits of using each other's patented inventions.", u'=== Ownership ===\nIn most countries, both natural persons and corporate entities may apply for a patent.', u'In the United States, however, only the inventor(s) may apply for a patent although it may be assigned to a corporate entity subsequently and inventors may be required to assign inventions to their employers under an employment contract.', u"In most European countries, ownership of an invention may pass from the inventor to their employer by rule of law if the invention was made in the course of the inventor's normal or specifically assigned employment duties, where an invention might reasonably be expected to result from carrying out those duties, or if the inventor had a special obligation to further the interests of the employer's company.", u'The inventors, their successors or their assignees become the proprietors of the patent when and if it is granted.', u'If a patent is granted to more than one proprietor, the laws of the country in question and any agreement between the proprietors may affect the extent to which each proprietor can exploit the patent.', u'For example, in some countries, each proprietor may freely license or assign their rights in the patent to another person while the law in other countries prohibits such actions without the permission of the other proprietor(s).', u'The ability to assign ownership rights increases the liquidity of a patent as property.', u'Inventors can obtain patents and then sell them to third parties.', u'The third parties then own the patents and have the same rights to prevent others from exploiting the claimed inventions, as if they had originally made the inventions themselves.', u'=== Governing laws ===\n\nThe grant and enforcement of patents are governed by national laws, and also by international treaties, where those treaties have been given effect in national laws.', u'Patents are granted by national or regional patent offices.', u'A given patent is therefore only useful for protecting an invention in the country in which that patent is granted.', u'In other words, patent law is territorial in nature.', u'When a patent application is published, the invention disclosed in the application becomes prior art and enters the public domain (if not protected by other patents) in countries where a patent applicant does not seek protection, the application thus generally becoming prior art against anyone (including the applicant) who might seek patent protection for the invention in those countries.', u"Commonly, a nation forms a patent office with responsibility for operating that nation's patent system, within the relevant patent laws.", u'The patent office generally has responsibility for the grant of patents, with infringement being the remit of national courts.', u'The authority for patent statutes in different countries varies.', u'In the UK, substantive patent law is contained in the Patents Act 1977 as amended.', u'In the United States, the Constitution empowers Congress to make laws to "promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts..." The laws Congress passed are codified in Title 35 of the United States Code and created the United States Patent and Trademark Office.', u'There is a trend towards global harmonization of patent laws, with the World Trade Organization (WTO) being particularly active in this area.', u'The TRIPs Agreement has been largely successful in providing a forum for nations to agree on an aligned set of patent laws.', u'Conformity with the TRIPs agreement is a requirement of admission to the WTO and so compliance is seen by many nations as important.', u'This has also led to many developing nations, which may historically have developed different laws to aid their development, enforcing patents laws in line with global practice.', u'In addition, there are international treaty procedures, such as the procedures under the European Patent Convention (EPC) [constituting the European Patent Organisation (EPOrg)], that centralize some portion of the filing and examination procedure.', u'Similar arrangements exist among the member states of ARIPO and OAPI, the analogous treaties among African countries, and the nine CIS member states that have formed the Eurasian Patent Organization.', u'A key international convention relating to patents is the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, initially signed in 1883.', u'The Paris Convention sets out a range of basic rules relating to patents, and although the convention does not have direct legal effect in all national jurisdictions, the principles of the convention are incorporated into all notable current patent systems.', u'The most significant aspect of the convention is the provision of the right to claim priority: filing an application in any one member state of the Paris Convention preserves the right for one year to file in any other member state, and receive the benefit of the original filing date.', u'Another key treaty is the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), administered by WIPO and covering more than 140 countries.', u'The Patent Cooperation Treaty provides a unified procedure for filing patent applications to protect inventions in each of its contracting states.', u'A patent application filed under the PCT is called an international application, or PCT application.', u'=== Application and prosecution ===\n\nA patent is requested by filing a written application at the relevant patent office.', u'The person or company filing the application is referred to as "the applicant".', u'The applicant may be the inventor or its assignee.', u'The application contains a description of how to make and use the invention that must provide sufficient detail for a person skilled in the art (i.e., the relevant area of technology) to make and use the invention.', u'In some countries there are requirements for providing specific information such as the usefulness of the invention, the best mode of performing the invention known to the inventor, or the technical problem or problems solved by the invention.', u'Drawings illustrating the invention may also be provided.', u'The application also includes one or more claims that define what a patent covers or the "scope of protection".', u'After filing, an application is often referred to as "patent pending".', u'While this term does not confer legal protection, and a patent cannot be enforced until granted, it serves to provide warning to potential infringers that if the patent is issued, they may be liable for damages.', u'Once filed, a patent application is "prosecuted".', u'A patent examiner reviews the patent application to determine if it meets the patentability requirements of that country.', u'If the application does not comply, objections are communicated to the applicant or their patent agent or attorney through an Office action, to which the applicant may respond.', u'The number of Office actions and responses that may occur vary from country to country, but eventually a final rejection is sent by the patent office, or the patent application is granted, which after the payment of additional fees, leads to an issued, enforceable patent.', u'In some jurisdictions, there are opportunities for third parties to bring an opposition proceeding between grant and issuance, or post-issuance.', u'Once granted the patent is subject in most countries to renewal fees to keep the patent in force.', u'These fees are generally payable on a yearly basis.', u'Some countries or regional patent offices (e.g.', u'the European Patent Office) also require annual renewal fees to be paid for a patent application before it is granted.', u'==== Costs ====\nThe costs of preparing and filing a patent application, prosecuting it until grant and maintaining the patent vary from one jurisdiction to another, and may also be dependent upon the type and complexity of the invention, and on the type of patent.', u'The European Patent Office estimated in 2005 that the average cost of obtaining a European patent (via a Euro-direct application, i.e.', u'not based on a PCT application) and maintaining the patent for a 10-year term was around \u20ac32,000.', u'Since the London Agreement entered into force on May 1, 2008, this estimation is however no longer up-to-date, since fewer translations are required.', u'In the United States, in 2000 the cost of obtaining a patent (patent prosecution) was estimated to be from $10,000 to $30,000 per patent.', u'When patent litigation is involved (which in year 1999 happened in about 1,600 cases compared to 153,000 patents issued in the same year), costs increase significantly: although 95% of patent litigation cases are settled out of court, those that reach the courts have legal costs on the order of a million dollars per case, not including associated business costs.', u'=== Alternatives to applying for a patent ===\nA defensive publication is the act of publishing a detailed description of a new invention without patenting it, so as to establish prior art and public identification as the creator/originator of an invention, although a defensive publication can also be anonymous.', u'A defensive publication prevents others from later being able to patent the invention.', u'A trade secret is information that is intentionally kept confidential and that provides a competitive advantage to its possessor.', u'Trade secrets are protected by nondisclosure agreements and employment law, each of which prevents information leaks such as breaches of confidentiality and corporate espionage.', u'Compared to patents, the advantages of trade secrets are that the value of a trade secret continues until it is made public, whereas a patent is only in force for a specified time, after which others may freely copy the invention; does not require payment of fees to governmental agencies or filing paperwork; has an immediate effect; and does not require any disclosure of information to the public.', u'The key disadvantage of a trade secret is its vulnerability to reverse engineering.', u'== Benefits ==\nPrimary incentives embodied in the patent system include incentives to invent in the first place; to disclose the invention once made; to invest the sums necessary to experiment, produce and market the invention; and to design around and improve upon earlier patents.', u'Patents provide incentives for economically efficient research and development (R&D).', u'A study conducted annually by the IPTS shows that the 2,000 largest global companies invested more than 430 billion euros in 2008 in their R&D departments.', u'If the investments can be considered as inputs of R&D, real products and patents are the outputs.', u'Based on these groups, a project named Corporate Invention Board, had measured and analyzed the patent portfolios to produce an original picture of their technological profiles.', u'Supporters of patents argue that without patent protection, R&D spending would be significantly less or eliminated altogether, limiting the possibility of technological advances or breakthroughs.', u'Corporations would be much more conservative about the R&D investments they made, as third parties would be free to exploit any developments.', u'This second justification is closely related to the basic ideas underlying traditional property rights.', u'Specifically, "[t]he patent internalizes the externality by giving the [inventor] a property right over its invention."', u'A 2008 study by Yi Quan of Kellogg School of Management showed that countries instituting patent protection on pharmecuticals did not necessarily have an increase in domestic pharmaceutical innovation.', u'Only countries with "higher levels of economic development, educational attainment, and economic freedom" showed an increase.', u'There also appeared to be an optimal level of patent protection that increased domestic innovation.', u'In accordance with the original definition of the term "patent", patents are intended to facilitate and encourage disclosure of innovations into the public domain for the common good.', u'Thus patenting can be viewed as contributing to open hardware after an embargo period (usually of 20 years).', u'If inventors did not have the legal protection of patents, in many cases, they might prefer or tend to keep their inventions secret (e.g.', u'keep trade secrets).', u'Awarding patents generally makes the details of new technology publicly available, for exploitation by anyone after the patent expires, or for further improvement by other inventors.', u"Furthermore, when a patent's term has expired, the public record ensures that the patentee's invention is not lost to humanity.", u'In many industries (especially those with high fixed costs and either low marginal costs or low reverse engineering costs \u2014 computer processors, and pharmaceuticals for example), once an invention exists, the cost of commercialization (testing, tooling up a factory, developing a market, etc.)', u'is far more than the initial conception cost.', u'(For example, the internal rule of thumb at several computer companies in the 1980s was that post-R&D costs were 7-to-1.)', u'One effect of modern patent usage is that a small-time inventor, who can afford both the patenting process and the defense of the patent, can use the exclusive right status to become a licensor.', u'This allows the inventor to accumulate capital from licensing the invention and may allow innovation to occur because he or she may choose not to manage a manufacturing buildup for the invention.', u"Thus the inventor's time and energy can be spent on pure innovation, allowing others to concentrate on manufacturability.", u'Another effect of modern patent usage is to both enable and incentivize competitors to design around (or to "invent around" according to R S Praveen Raj) the patented invention.', u'This may promote healthy competition among manufacturers, resulting in gradual improvements of the technology base.', u'This may help augment national economies and confer better living standards to the citizens.', u'The 1970 Indian Patent Act allowed the Indian pharmaceutical industry to develop local technological capabilities in this industry.', u'This act coincided with the transformation of India from a bulk importer of pharmaceutical drugs to a leading exporter.', u'The rapid evolution of Indian pharmaceutical industry since the mid-1970s highlights the fact that the design of the patent act was instrumental in building local capabilities even in a developing country like India.', u'== Criticism ==\n\nLegal scholars, economists, activists, policymakers, industries, and trade organizations have held differing views on patents and engaged in contentious debates on the subject.', u'Critical perspectives emerged in the nineteenth century that were especially based on the principles of free trade.', u'Contemporary criticisms have echoed those arguments, claiming that patents block innovation and waste resources (e.g.', u'with patent-related overheads) that could otherwise be used productively to improve technology.', u'These and other research findings that patents decreased innovation because of the following mechanisms:\nLow quality, already known or obvious patents hamper innovation and commercialization.', u'Blocking the use of fundamental knowledge with patents creates a "tragedy of the anticommons, where future innovations can not take place outside of a single firm in an entire field.', u'Patents weaken the public domain and innovation that comes from it.', u'Patent thickets, or an "an overlapping set of patent rights", in particular slow innovation.', u'Broad patents prevent companies from commercializing products and hurt innovation.', u'In the worst case, such broad patents are held by non-practicing entities (patent trolls), which do not contribute to innovation.', u'Enforcement by patent trolls of poor quality patents  has led to criticism of the patent office as well as the system itself.', u'For example, in 2011, United States business entities incurred $29 billion in direct costs because of patent trolls.', u'Lawsuits brought by "patent assertion companies" made up 61% of all patent cases in 2012, according to the Santa Clara University School of Law.', u'Patents apply a "one size fits all" model to industries with differing needs, that is especially unproductive for the software industry.', u'Rent seeking by owners of pharmaceutical patents have also been a particular focus of criticism, as the high prices they enable puts life-saving drugs out of reach of many people.', u'Boldrin and Levine conclude "Our preferred policy solution is to abolish patents entirely and to find other legislative instruments, less open to lobbying and rent seeking, to foster innovation when there is clear evidence that laissez-faire undersupplies it."', u'Abolishing patents may be politically challenging in some countries, however, as the primary economic theories supporting patent law hold that inventors and innovators need patents to recoup the costs associated with research, inventing, and commercializing; this reasoning is weakened if the new technologies decrease these costs.', u'A 2016 paper argued for substantial weakening of patents because current technologies (e.g.', u'3-D printing, cloud computing, synthetic biology, etc.)', u'have reduced the cost of innovation.', u'Debates over the usefulness of patents for their primary objective are part of a larger discourse on intellectual property protection, which also reflects differing perspectives on copyright.', u'=== Anti-patent initiatives ===\nThe Patent Busting Project is an Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) initiative challenging patents that the organization claims are illegitimate and suppress innovation or limit online expression.', u'The initiative launched in 2004 and involves two phases: documenting the damage caused by these patents, and submitting challenges to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).', u'Patent critic, Joseph E. Stiglitz has proposed Prizes as an alternative to patents in order to further advance solutions to global problems such as AIDS.', u'In 2012, Stack Exchange launched Ask Patents, a forum for crowdsourcing prior art to invalidate patents.', u'Several authors have argued for developing defensive prior art to prevent patenting based on obviousness using lists  or algorithms.', u'For example, a Professor of Law at the University of North Carolina, has demonstrated a method to protect DNA research., which could can apply to other technology.', u'Chin wrote an algorithm to generate 11 million "obvious" nucleotide sequences to count as prior art and his algorithmic approach has already proven effective at anticipating prior art against oligonucleotide composition claims filed since his publication of the list and has been cited by the U.S. patent office a number of times.', u'More recently, Joshua Pearce developed an open-source algorithm for identifying prior art for 3-D printing materials to make such materials obvious by patent standards.', u'As the 3-D printing community is already grappling with legal issues, this development was hotly debated in the technical press.', u'Chin made the same algorithem-based obvious argument in DNA probes.', u'Google and other technology companies founded the LOT Network in 2014 to combat patent assertion entities by cross-licensing patents, thereby preventing legal action by such entities.', u'== See also ==\nList of people associated with patent law\nOutline of patents\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDirectory of Intellectual Property Offices, maintained by World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)\nUseful links, maintained by the European Patent Office\nOECD Patent statistics\nHenderson, David R.

them.', u'Veterans are also subject to illnesses directly related to their military service such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).', u'War veterans are generally treated with great respect and

to the dead.', u'In Russia, a tradition was established after World War II where newly married couples would on their wedding day visit a military cemetery.', u'In France, for instance, those wounded in war are given the first claim on any seat on public transit.', u'Most countries have a holiday such as Veterans Day to honour their veterans, along with the war dead.', u'In Zimbabwe the term veteran is used for political purpose and may not actually refer to someone that participated in a war, but still feels entitled to some benefit because of association with a cause for which there had been an actual war.', u"== Veterans' experiences around the world ==\n\n\n=== Britain ===\n\nBritain, with its historic distrust of standing armies, did little for its veterans before the 19th century.", u'It did set up two small hospitals for them in the 1680s.', u'In London and other cities the streets teemed with disabled or disfigured veterans begging for alms.', u'The First World War focused national attention on veterans, especially those who had been partly or wholly disabled.', u"The King's National Roll Scheme (KNRS) was an employment program for disabled veterans of the First World War.", u'Kowalsky says it was practical, innovative, and ahead of its time and was the most important piece of legislation enacted for disabled veterans in interwar Britain.', u'In addition to direct aid, it stimulate a national discussion regarding the need for employment programs for disabled veterans and the responsibility of the state, setting up a future demand for more benefits.', u'In the 21st century Britain has one of the highest densities of veterans in a major country, with 13 million in 2000, or 219 per 1000 population.', u'=== The Congo ===\n\nSome veterans from the Belgian commitment of the Congolese to WWII live in communities throughout the Congo.', u'Though they received compensation from the government during the rule of the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, after his overthrow they no longer receive pensions.', u'=== United States ===\n\nThe most common usage is for former armed services personnel.', u'A veteran is one who has served in the armed forces, especially one who has served in combat.', u'The National Guard and Reserve is included.', u'It is especially applied to those who served for an entire career, usually of 20 years or more, but may be applied for someone who has only served one tour of duty.', u'A common misconception is that only those who have served in combat or those who have retired from active duty can be called military veterans.', u'==== Veterans\' benefits in the United States ====\nPresident Abraham Lincoln, in his second inaugural address, in 1865 towards the end of the American Civil War, famously called for good treatment of veterans: "to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan".', u"The American Civil War produced veterans' organizations, such as the Grand Army of the Republic and United Confederate Veterans.", u'The treatment of veterans changed after the First World War.', u'In the years following, discontented veterans became a source of instability.', u'They could quickly organize, had links to the army, and often had arms themselves.', u'The Bonus Army of unemployed veterans was one of the most important protest movements of the Great Depression, marching on Washington, DC, to get a claimed bonus now that Congress had promised them decades in the future.', u"Each state of the United States sets specific criteria for state-specific veterans' benefits.", u'For federal medical benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals, prior to 7 September 1980 the veteran must have served at least 180 days of active duty, after the above-mentioned date, the veteran must have served at least 24 months.', u'However, if the veteran was medically discharged and receives a VA service-connected disability stipend, the time limits are not applicable.', u"==== American veteran experience after World War II ====\n\nAfter the Second World War, in part due to the experience of the First World War, most of the participating states set up elaborate veterans' administrations.", u'Within the United States, it was veterans groups, like the American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars organization, that pushed for and got the G.I.', u'Bill enacted.', u'These gave veterans access to free or subsidized education and health care.', u'The newly educated GIs created a significant economic impact, and with the aid of VA loans were able

veteran experience after OEF and OIF ====\nMany veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom have had to face challenges unique to warfare in the 21st century.', u'One significant difference between OEF and OIF and previous wars is a greater dependence on reservists and repeat deployments.', u'Up to 80% of troops deployed at the beginning of OEF were part of the National Guard and Reserve and about 40% of currently serving military members have been deployed more than once.', u'This has meant that many deployed troops, not being as \u201c steeped in military culture \u201d have had more difficult transitions into military life, and for many the increased redeployment rate has meant more transitions, more uncertainty, longer terms, and shorter dwell times, all of which contribute to greater stress.', u'Due to medical advances, warfare in the 21st century tends to yield more survivors with severe injuries which soldiers in previous wars would have died from.', u'This means that, though fewer service members die, more return from war with injuries more serious, and in turn more emotionally devastating, than ever before.', u'Among these injuries is the increasingly common traumatic brain injury, or TBI, the effects of which can range from a mild concussion to amnesia and serious neurological damage.', u'==== Female veterans in the U.S. ====\n\nWomen have served in the United States military for over two hundred years.', u'Some female veterans perceive themselves as discriminated against by their male counterparts and, as such, women who have served in the armed forces have sometimes been known as "the invisible veterans".', u'Women were not fully recognized as veterans until after WWII, and prior to this they were not eligible for VA benefits.', u'The current percentage of U.S. Veterans who are women is more than 8 percent.', u'Women make up nearly 11.6 percent of OEF/OIF/OND Veterans.', u'A tri-state (Washington, Idaho, Oregon) women veterans conference in Pendleton, Oregon, in April 2008, attracted 362 women veterans, according to the East Oregonian newspaper.', u'On August 5, 2011, Erica Borggren was appointed Director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs and has been "creating a new Women Veterans Program to help address the issue that women veterans often do not self-identify as veterans and do

than novae.', u'In Latin, nova means "new", referring astronomically to what appears to be a temporary new bright star.', u'Adding the prefix "super-" distinguishes supernovae from ordinary novae, which are far less luminous.', u'The word supernova was coined by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky in 1931.', u'It is pronounced /\u02ccsu\u02d0p\u0259rno\u028av\u0259/ with the plural supernovae /\u02ccsu\u02d0p\u0259rno\u028avi\u02d0/ or supernovas (abbreviated SN, plural SNe after "supernovae").', u'During maximum brightness, the total equivalent radiant energies produced by supernovae may briefly outshine an entire output of a typical galaxy and emit energies equal to that created over the lifetime of any solar-like star.', u'Such extreme catastrophes may also expel much, if not all, of its stellar material away from the star, at velocities up to 7007300000000000000\u266030,000 km/s or 10% of the speed of light.', u'This drives an expanding and fast-moving shock wave into the surrounding interstellar medium, and in turn, sweeping up an expanding shell of gas and dust, which is observed as a supernova remnant.', u'Supernovae create, fuse and eject the bulk of the chemical elements produced by nucleosynthesis.', u'Supernovae play a significant role in enriching the interstellar medium with the heavier atomic mass chemical elements.', u'Furthermore, the expanding shock waves from supernova explosions can trigger the formation of new stars.', u'Supernova remnants are expected to accelerate a large fraction of galactic primary cosmic rays, but direct evidence for cosmic ray production was found only in a few of them so far.', u'They are also potentially strong galactic sources of gravitational waves.', u"Theoretical studies of many supernovae indicate that most are triggered by one of two basic mechanisms: the sudden re-ignition of nuclear fusion in a degenerate star or the sudden gravitational collapse of a massive star's core.", u'In the first instance, a degenerate white dwarf may accumulate sufficient material from a binary companion, either through accretion or via a merger, to raise its core temperature enough to trigger runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting the star.', u'In the second case, the core of a massive star may undergo sudden gravitational collapse, releasing gravitational potential energy as a supernova.', u'While some observed supernovae are more complex than these two simplified theories, the astrophysical collapse mechanics have been established and accepted by most astronomers for some time.', u'Due to the wide range of astrophysical consequences of these events, astronomers now deem supernovae research, across the fields of stellar and galactic evolution, as an especially important area for investigation.', u'== Etymology ==\nIn Latin, Nova means "new", referring astronomically to what appears to be a temporary new bright star.', u'Adding the prefix "super-" distinguishes supernovae from ordinary novae, which are far less luminous.', u'The word supernova was coined by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky in 1931.', u'It is pronounced /\u02ccsu\u02d0p\u0259rno\u028av\u0259/ with the plural

by Chinese astronomers in 185 AD, with the brightest recorded supernova being SN 1006, which occurred in 1006 AD and was described in detail by Chinese and Islamic astronomers.', u'The widely observed supernova SN 1054 produced the Crab Nebula.', u'Supernovae SN 1572 and SN 1604, the latest to be observed with the naked eye in the Milky Way galaxy, had notable effects on the development of astronomy in Europe because they were used to argue against the Aristotelian idea that the universe beyond the Moon and planets was static and unchanging.', u'Johannes Kepler began observing SN 1604 at its peak on October 17, 1604, and continued to make estimates of its brightness until it faded from naked eye view a year later.', u'It was the second supernova to be observed in a generation (after SN 1572 seen by Tycho Brahe in Cassiopeia).', u'Before the development of the telescope, there have only been five supernovae seen in the last millennium.', u"In the perspective of how long a star's lifetime is, its death is very brief.", u"In fact, a star's death may only last a few months.", u'Due to this, a typical human will only experience this rarity, on average, once in their lifetime.', u'This is a microscopic fraction in comparison to the 100 billion stars that compose a galaxy.', u'However, since the use of modern equipment, particularly in this millennium, professional and amateur astronomers have been finding several hundreds of supernovae each year.', u'The field of supernova discovery has extended to other galaxies, starting with SN 1885A in the Andromeda galaxy.', u'American astronomers Rudolph Minkowski and Fritz Zwicky developed the modern supernova classification scheme beginning in 1941.', u'In the 1960s, astronomers found that the maximum intensities of supernova explosions could be used as standard candles, hence indicators of astronomical distances.', u'Some of the most distant supernovae recently observed appeared dimmer than expected.', u'This supports the view that the expansion of the universe is accelerating.', u'Techniques were developed for reconstructing supernova explosions that have no written records of being observed.', u'The date of the Cassiopeia A supernova event was determined from light echoes off nebulae, while the age of supernova remnant RX J0852.0-4622 was estimated from temperature measurements and the gamma ray emissions from the decay of titanium-44.', u'The brightest observed supernova, ASASSN-15lh, was detected in June 2015.', u"With a brightness of 570 billion Suns, ASASSN-15lh's peak luminosity was twice that of the previous record holder.", u'== Discovery ==\n\nEarly work on what was originally believed to be simply a new category of novae was performed during the 1930s by two astronomers named Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky at Mount Wilson Observatory.', u'The name super-novae was first used during 1931 lectures held at Caltech by Baade and Zwicky, then used publicly in 1933 at a meeting of the American Physical Society.', u'By 1938, the hyphen had been lost and the modern name was in use.', u'Because supernovae are relatively rare events within a galaxy, occurring about three times a century in the Milky Way, obtaining a good sample of supernovae to study requires regular monitoring of many galaxies.', u'Supernovae in other galaxies cannot be predicted with any meaningful accuracy.', u'Normally, when they are discovered, they are already in progress.', u'Most scientific interest in supernovae\u2014as standard candles for measuring distance, for example\u2014require an observation of their peak luminosity.', u'It is therefore important to discover them well before they reach their maximum.', u'Amateur astronomers, who greatly outnumber professional astronomers, have played an important role in finding supernovae, typically by looking at some of the closer galaxies through an optical telescope and comparing them to earlier photographs.', u'Toward the end of the 20th century astronomers increasingly turned to computer-controlled telescopes and CCDs for hunting supernovae.', u'While such systems are popular with amateurs, there are also professional installations such as the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope.', u'Recently the Supernova Early Warning System (SNEWS) project has begun using a network of neutrino detectors to give early warning of a supernova in the Milky Way galaxy.', u'Neutrinos are particles that are produced in great quantities by a supernova explosion, and they are not significantly absorbed by the interstellar gas and dust of the galactic disk.', u'Supernova searches fall into two classes: those focused on relatively nearby events and those looking for explosions farther away.', u'Because of the expansion of the universe, the distance to a remote object with a known emission spectrum can be estimated by measuring its Doppler shift (or redshift); on average, more distant objects recede with greater velocity than those nearby, and so have a higher redshift.', u"Thus the search is split between high redshift and low redshift, with the boundary falling around a redshift range of z = 0.1\u20130.3\u2014where z is a dimensionless measure of the spectrum's frequency shift.", u'High redshift searches for supernovae usually involve the observation of supernova light curves.', u'These are useful for standard or calibrated candles to generate Hubble diagrams and make cosmological predictions.', u'Supernova spectroscopy, used to study the physics and environments of supernovae, is more practical at low than at high redshift.', u'Low redshift observations also anchor the low-distance end of the Hubble curve, which is a plot of distance versus redshift for visible galaxies.', u"(See also Hubble's law).", u"== Naming convention ==\n\nSupernova discoveries are reported to the International Astronomical Union's Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, which sends out a circular with the name it assigns to that supernova.", u'The name is the marker SN followed by the year of discovery, suffixed with a one or two-letter designation.', u'The first 26 supernovae of the year are designated with a capital letter from A to Z.', u'Afterward pairs of lower-case letters are used: aa, ab, and so on.', u'Hence, for example, SN 2003C designates the third supernova reported in the year 2003.', u'The last supernova of 2005 was SN 2005nc, indicating that it was the 367th supernova found in 2005.', u'Since 2000, professional and amateur astronomers have been finding several hundreds of supernovae each year (572 in 2007, 261 in 2008, 390 in 2009; 231 in 2013).', u"Historical supernovae are known simply by the year they occurred: SN 185, SN 1006, SN 1054, SN 1572 (called Tycho's Nova) and SN 1604 (Kepler's Star).", u'Since 1885 the additional letter notation has been used, even if there was only one supernova discovered that year (e.g.', u'SN 1885A, SN 1907A, etc.)', u'\u2014 this last happened with SN 1947A.', u'SN, for SuperNova, is a standard prefix.', u'Until 1987, two-letter designations were rarely needed; since 1988, however, they have been needed every year.', u'== Classification ==\n\nAs part of the attempt to understand supernovae, astronomers have classified them according to their light curves and the absorption lines of different chemical elements that appear in their spectra.', u'The first element for division is the presence or absence of a line caused by hydrogen.', u"If a supernova's spectrum contains lines of hydrogen (known as the Balmer series in the visual portion of the spectrum) it is classified Type II; otherwise it is Type I.", u"In each of these two types there are subdivisions according to the presence of lines from other elements or the shape of the light curve (a graph of the supernova's apparent magnitude as a function of time).", u'=== Type I ===\nType I supernovae are subdivided on the basis of their spectra, with type Ia showing a strong ionised silicon absorption line.', u'Type I supernovae without this strong line are classified as Type Ib and Ic, with Type Ib showing strong neutral helium lines and Type Ic lacking them.', u'The light curves are all similar, although Type Ia are generally brighter at peak luminosity, but the light curve is not important for classification of Type I supernovae.', u'A small number of Type Ia supernovae exhibit unusual features such as non-standard luminosity or broadened light curves, and these are typically classified by referring to the earliest example showing similar features.', u'For example, the sub-luminous SN 2008ha is often referred to as SN 2002cx-like or class Ia-2002cx.', u'=== Type II ===\n\nThe supernovae of Type II can also be sub-divided based on their spectra.', u'While most Type II supernovae show very broad emission lines which indicate expansion velocities of many thousands of kilometres per second, some, such as SN 2005gl, have relatively narrow features in their spectra.', u"These are called Type IIn, where the 'n' stands for 'narrow'.", u'A few supernovae, such as SN 1987K and SN 1993J, appear to change types: they show lines of hydrogen at early times, but, over a period of weeks to months, become dominated by lines of helium.', u'The term "Type IIb" is used to describe the combination of features normally associated with Types II and Ib.', u'Type II supernovae with normal spectra dominated by broad hydrogen lines that remain for the life of the decline are classified on the basis of their light curves.', u'The most common type shows a distinctive "plateau" in the light curve shortly after peak brightness where the visual luminosity stays relatively constant for several months before the decline resumes.', u'These are called type II-P referring to the plateau.', u'Less common are type II-L supernovae that lack a distinct plateau.', u'The "L" signifies "linear" although the light curve is not actually a straight line.', u"Supernovae that do not fit into the normal classifications are designated peculiar, or 'pec'.", u"=== Types III, IV, and V ===\nFritz Zwicky defined additional supernovae types, although based on a very few examples that didn't cleanly fit the parameters for a Type I or Type II supernova.", u'SN 1961i in NGC 4303 was the prototype and only member of the Type III supernova class, noted for its broad light curve maximum and broad hydrogen Balmer lines that were slow to develop in the spectrum.', u'SN 1961f in NGC 3003 was the prototype and only member of the Type IV class, with a light curve similar to a Type II-P supernova, with hydrogen absorption lines but weak hydrogen emission lines.', u'The Type V class was coined for SN 1961V in NGC 1058, an unusual faint supernova or supernova imposter with a slow rise to brightness, a maximum lasting many months, and an unusual emission spectrum.', u'The similarity of SN 1961V to the Eta Carinae Great Outburst was noted.', u'Supernovae in M101 (1909) and M83 (1923 and 1957) were also suggested as possible type IV or type V supernovae.', u'These types would now all be treated as peculiar Type II supernovae, of which many more examples have been discovered, although it is still debated whether SN 1961V was a true supernova following an LBV outburst or an imposter.', u'== Current models ==\n\nThe type codes, described above given to supernovae, are taxonomic in nature: the type number describes the light observed from the supernova, not necessarily its cause.', u'For example, type Ia supernovae are produced by runaway fusion ignited on degenerate white dwarf progenitors while the spectrally similar type Ib/c are produced from massive Wolf-Rayet progenitors by core collapse.', u'The following summarizes what is currently believed to be the most plausible explanations for supernovae.', u'=== Thermal runaway ===\n\nA white dwarf star may accumulate sufficient material from a stellar companion to raise its core temperature enough to ignite carbon fusion, at which point it undergoes runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting it.', u'There are three avenues by which this detonation is theorized to happen: stable accretion of material from a companion, the collision of two white dwarfs, or accretion that causes ignition in a shell that then ignites.', u'The dominant mechanism by which Type Ia supernovae are produced remains unclear.', u'Despite this uncertainty in how Type Ia supernovae are produced, Type Ia supernovae have very uniform properties, and are useful standard candles over intergalactic distances.', u'Some calibrations are required to compensate for the gradual change in properties or different frequencies of abnormal luminosity supernovae at high red shift, and for small variations in brightness identified by light curve shape or spectrum.', u'==== Normal Type Ia ====\nThere are several means by which a supernova of this type can form, but they share a common underlying mechanism.', u'If a carbon-oxygen white dwarf accreted enough matter to reach the Chandrasekhar limit of about 1.44 solar masses (M\u2609) (for a non-rotating star), it would no longer be able to support the bulk of its mass through electron degeneracy pressure and would begin to collapse.', u'However, the current view is that this limit is not normally attained; increasing temperature and density inside the core ignite carbon fusion as the star approaches the limit (to within about 1%), before collapse is initiated.', u'Within a few seconds, a substantial fraction of the matter in the white dwarf undergoes nuclear fusion, releasing enough energy (1\u20137044200000000000000\u26602\xd71044 J) to unbind the star in a supernova explosion.', u'An outwardly expanding shock wave is generated, with matter reaching velocities on the order of 5,000\u201320,000 km/s, or roughly 3% of the speed of light.', u'There is also a significant increase in luminosity, reaching an absolute magnitude of \u221219.3 (or 5 billion times brighter than the Sun), with little variation.', u'The model for the formation of this category of supernova is a closed binary star system.', u'The larger of the two stars is the first to evolve off the main sequence, and it expands to form a red giant.', u'The two stars now share a common envelope, causing their mutual orbit to shrink.', u'The giant star then sheds most of its envelope, losing mass until it can no longer continue nuclear fusion.', u'At this point it becomes a white dwarf star, composed primarily of carbon and oxygen.', u'Eventually the secondary star also evolves off the main sequence to form a red giant.', u'Matter from the giant is accreted by the white dwarf, causing the latter to increase in mass.', u'Despite widespread acceptance of the basic model, the exact details of initiation and of the heavy elements produced in the explosion are still unclear.', u'Type Ia supernovae follow a characteristic light curve\u2014the graph of luminosity as a function of time\u2014after the explosion.', u'This luminosity is generated by the radioactive decay of nickel-56 through cobalt-56 to iron-56.', u'The peak luminosity of the light curve is extremely consistent across normal Type Ia supernovae, having a maximum absolute magnitude of about \u221219.3.', u'This allows them to be used as a secondary standard candle to measure the distance to their host galaxies.', u'==== Non-standard Type Ia ====\nAnother model for the formation of a Type Ia explosion involves the merger of two white dwarf stars, with the combined mass momentarily exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit.', u'There is much variation in this type of explosion, and in many cases there may be no supernova at all, but it is expected that they will have a broader and less luminous light curve than the more normal Type Ia explosions.', u'Abnormally bright Type Ia supernovae are expected when the white dwarf already has a mass higher than the Chandrasekhar limit, possibly enhanced further by asymmetry, but the ejected material will have less than normal kinetic energy.', u'There is no formal sub-classification for the non-standard Type Ia supernovae.', u'It has been proposed that a group of sub-luminous supernovae that occur when helium accretes onto a white dwarf should be classified as type Iax.', u'This type of supernova may not always completely destroy the white dwarf progenitor and could leave behind a zombie star.', u'One specific type of non-standard Type Ia supernova develops hydrogen, and other, emission lines and gives the appearance of mixture between a normal Type Ia and a Type IIn supernova.', u'Examples are SN 2002ic and SN 2005gj.', u'These supernova have been dubbed Type Ia/IIn, Type Ian, Type IIa and Type IIan.', u'=== Core collapse ===\n\nVery massive stars can undergo core collapse when nuclear fusion suddenly becomes unable to sustain the core against its own gravity; this is the cause of all types of supernova except type Ia.', u'The collapse may cause violent expulsion of the outer layers of the star resulting in a supernova, or the release of gravitational potential energy may be insufficient and the star may collapse into a black hole or neutron star with little radiated energy.', u'Core collapse can be caused by several different mechanisms: electron capture; exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit; pair-instability; or photodisintegration.', u'When a massive star develops an iron core larger than the Chandrasekhar mass it will no longer be able to support itself by electron degeneracy pressure and will collapse further to a neutron star or black hole.', u'Electron capture by magnesium in a degenerate O/Ne/Mg core causes gravitational collapse followed by explosive oxygen fusion, with very similar results.', u'Electron-positron pair production in a large post-helium burning core removes thermodynamic support and causes initial collapse followed by runaway fusion, resulting in a pair-instability supernova.', u'A sufficiently large and hot stellar core may generate gamma-rays energetic enough to initiate photodisintegration directly, which will cause a complete collapse of the core.', u'The table below lists the known reasons for core collapse in massive stars, the types of star that they occur in, their associated supernova type, and the remnant produced.', u'The metallicity is the proportion of elements other than hydrogen or helium, as compared to the Sun.', u"The initial mass is the mass of the star prior to the supernova event, given in multiples of the Sun's mass, although the mass at the time of the supernova may be much lower.", u'Type IIn supernovae are not listed in the table.', u'They can potentially be produced by various types of core collapse in different progenitor stars, possibly even by type Ia white dwarf ignitions, although it seems that most will be from iron core collapse in luminous supergiants or hypergiants (including LBVs).', u'The narrow spectral lines for which they are named occur because the supernova is expanding into a small dense cloud of circumstellar material.', u'It appears that a significant proportion of supposed type IIn supernovae are actually supernova imposters, massive eruptions of LBV-like stars similar to the Great Eruption of Eta Carinae.', u'In these events, material previously ejected from the star creates the narrow absorption lines and causes a shock wave through interaction with the newly ejected material.', u'When a stellar core is no longer supported against gravity it collapses in on itself with velocities reaching 70,000 km/s (0.23c), resulting in a rapid increase in temperature and density.', u'What follows next depends on the mass and structure of the collapsing core, with low mass degenerate cores forming neutron stars, higher mass degenerate cores mostly collapsing completely to black holes, and non-degenerate cores undergoing runaway fusion.', u'The initial collapse of degenerate cores is accelerated by beta decay, photodisintegration and electron capture, which causes a burst of electron neutrinos.', u'As the density increases, neutrino emission is cut off as they become trapped in the core.', u'The inner core eventually reaches typically 30 km diameter and a density comparable to that of an atomic nucleus, and neutron degeneracy pressure tries to halt the collapse.', u'If the core mass is more than about 15 M\u2609 then neutron degeneracy is insufficient to stop the collapse and a black hole forms directly with no supernova explosion.', u"In lower mass cores the collapse is stopped and the newly formed neutron core has an initial temperature of about 100 billion kelvin, 6000 times the temperature of the sun's core.", u'At this temperature, neutrino-antineutrino pairs of all flavors are efficiently formed by thermal emission.', u'These thermal neutrinos are several times more abundant than the electron-capture neutrinos.', u"About 1046 joules, approximately 10% of the star's rest mass, is converted into a ten-second burst of neutrinos which is the main output of the event.", u'The suddenly halted core collapse rebounds and produces a shock wave that stalls within milliseconds in the outer core as energy is lost through the dissociation of heavy elements.', u'A process that is not clearly understood is necessary to allow the outer layers of the core to reabsorb around 1044 joules (1 foe) from the neutrino pulse, producing the visible explosion, although there are also other theories on how to power the explosion.', u'Some material from the outer envelope falls back onto the neutron star, and for cores beyond about 8 M\u2609 there is sufficient fallback to form a black hole.', u'This fallback will reduce the kinetic energy of the explosion and the mass of expelled radioactive material, but in some situations it may also generate relativistic jets that result in a gamma-ray burst or an exceptionally luminous supernova.', u'Collapse of massive non-degenerate cores will ignite further fusion.', u'When the core collapse is initiated by pair instability, oxygen fusion begins and the collapse may be halted.', u'For core masses of 40\u201360 M\u2609, the collapse halts and the star remains intact, but core collapse will occur again when a larger core has formed.', u'For cores of around 60\u2013130 M\u2609, the fusion of oxygen and heavier elements is so energetic that the entire star is disrupted, causing a supernova.', u'At the upper end of the mass range, the supernova is unusually luminous and extremely long-lived due to many solar masses of ejected 56Ni.', u'For even larger core masses, the core temperature becomes high enough to allow photodisintegration and the core collapses completely into a black hole.', u'==== Type II ====\n\nStars with initial masses less than about eight times the sun never develop a core large enough to collapse and they eventually lose their atmospheres to become white dwarfs.', u'Stars with at least 9 M\u2609 (possibly as much as 12 M\u2609) evolve in a complex fashion, progressively burning heavier elements at hotter temperatures in their cores.', u'The star becomes layered like an onion, with the burning of more easily fused elements occurring in larger shells.', u'Although popularly described as an onion with an iron core, the least massive supernova progenitors only have oxygen-neon(-magnesium) cores.', u'These super AGB stars may form the majority of core collapse supernovae, although less luminous and so less commonly observed than those from more massive progenitors.', u'If core collapse occurs during a supergiant phase when the star still has a hydrogen envelope, the result is a Type II supernova.', u'The rate of mass loss for luminous stars depends on the metallicity and luminosity.', u'Extremely luminous stars at near solar metallicity will lose all their hydrogen before they reach core collapse and so will not form a type II supernova.', u'At low metallicity, all stars will reach core collapse with a hydrogen envelope but sufficiently massive stars collapse directly to a black hole without producing a visible supernova.', u'Stars with an initial mass up to about 90 times the sun, or a little less at high metallicity, are expected to result in a type II-P supernova which is the most commonly observed type.', u'At moderate to high metallicity, stars near the upper end of that mass range will have lost most of their hydrogen when core collapse occurs and the result will be a Type II-L supernova.', u'At very low metallicity, stars of around 140\u2013250 M\u2609 will reach core collapse by pair instability while they still have a hydrogen atmosphere and an oxygen core and the result will be a supernova with Type II characteristics but a very large mass of ejected 56Ni and high luminosity.', u'==== Type Ib and Ic ====\n\nThese supernovae, like those of Type II, are massive stars that undergo core collapse.', u'However the stars which become Types Ib and Ic supernovae have lost most of their outer (hydrogen) envelopes due to strong stellar winds or else from interaction with a companion.', u'These stars are known as Wolf-Rayet stars, and they occur at moderate to high metallicity where continuum driven winds cause sufficiently high mass loss rates.', u'Observations of type Ib/c supernova do not match the observed or expected occurrence of Wolf Rayet stars and alternate explanations for this type of core collapse supernova involve stars stripped of their hydrogen by binary interactions.', u'Binary models provide a better match for the observed supernovae, with the proviso that no suitable binary helium stars have ever been observed.', u'Since a supernova explosion can occur whenever the mass of the star at the time of core collapse is low enough not to cause complete fallback to a black hole, any massive star may result in a supernova if it loses enough mass before core collapse occurs.', u'Type Ib supernovae are the more common and result from Wolf-Rayet stars of type WC which still have helium in their atmospheres.', u'For a narrow range of masses, stars evolve further before reaching core collapse to become WO stars with very little helium remaining and these are the progenitors of type Ic supernovae.', u'A few percent of the Type Ic supernovae are associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRB), though it is also believed that any hydrogen-stripped Type Ib or Ic supernova could produce a GRB, depending on the geometry of the explosion.', u'The mechanism for producing this type of GRB is the jets produced by the magnetic field of the rapidly spinning magnetar formed at the collapsing core of the star.', u'The jets would also transfer energy into the expanding outer shell of the explosion to produce a super-luminous supernova.', u'Ultra-stripped supernovae occur when the exploding star has been stripped (almost) all the way to the metal core, via mass transfer in a close binary.', u'As a result, very little material is ejected from the exploding star (~0.1 MSun).', u'In the most extreme cases, ultra-stripped supernovae can occur in naked metal cores, barely above the Chandrasekhar mass limit.', u'SN 2005ek might be an observational example of an ultra-stripped supernova, giving rise to a relatively dim and fast decaying light curve.', u'The nature of ultra-stripped supernovae can be both iron core-collapse and electron capture supernovae, depending on the mass of the collapsing core.', u'=== Failed ===\nThe core collapse of some massive stars may not result in a visible supernova.', u'The main model for this is a sufficiently massive core that the explosion is insufficient to reverse the infall of the outer layers onto a black hole.', u'These events are difficult to detect, but large surveys have detected possible candidates.', u'=== Light curves ===\n\nA historic puzzle concerned the source of energy that can maintain the optical supernova glow for months.', u'Although the energy that disrupts each type of supernovae is delivered promptly, the light curves are mostly dominated by subsequent radioactive heating of the rapidly expanding ejecta.', u'Some have considered rotational energy from the central pulsar.', u'The ejecta gases would dim quickly without some energy input to keep it hot.', u'The intensely radioactive nature of the ejecta gases, which is now known to be correct for most supernovae, was first calculated on sound nucleosynthesis grounds in the late 1960s.', u'It was not until SN 1987A that direct observation of gamma-ray lines unambiguously identified the major radioactive nuclei.', u'It is now known by direct observation that much of the light curve (the graph of luminosity as a function of time) after the explosion of a Type II Supernova such as SN 1987A is provided its energy by those predicted radioactive decays.', u'Although the luminous emission consists of optical photons, it is the radioactive power absorbed by the ejected gases that keeps the remnant hot enough to radiate light.', u'The radioactive decay of 56Ni through its daughters 56Co to 56Fe produces gamma-ray photons , primarily of 847keV and 1238keV, that are absorbed and dominate the heating and thus the luminosity of the ejecta at intermediate times (several weeks) to late times (several months).', u'Energy for the peak of the light curve of SN1987A was provided by the decay of 56Ni to 56Co (half life 6 days) while energy for the later light curve in particular fit very closely with the 77.3 day half-life of 56Co decaying to 56Fe.', u'Later measurements by space gamma-ray telescopes of the small fraction of the 56Co and 57Co gamma rays that escaped the SN 1987A remnant without absorption confirmed earlier predictions that those two radioactive nuclei were the power sources.', u'The visual light curves of the different supernova types all depend at late times on radioactive heating, but they vary in shape and amplitude on the underlying mechanisms of the explosion, the way that visible radiation is produced, the epoch of its observation, and the transparency of the ejected material.', u'The light curves can be significantly different at other wavelengths.', u'For example, at ultraviolet wavelengths there is an early extremely luminous peak lasting only a few hours corresponding to the breakout of the shock launched by the initial explosion, but that breakout is hardly detectable optically.', u'The light curves for type Ia are mostly very uniform, with a consistent maximum absolute magnitude and a relatively steep decline in luminosity.', u'Their optical energy output is driven by radioactive decay of nickel-56 (half life 6 days), which then decays to radioactive cobalt-56 (half life 77 days).', u'These radioisotopes from material ejected in the explosion excite surrounding material to incandescence.', u'Studies of cosmology today rely on 56Ni radioactivity providing the energy for the optical brightness of supernovae of Type Ia, which are the "standard candles" of cosmology but whose diagnostic 847keV and 1238keV gamma rays were first detected only in 2014.', u'The initial phases of the light curve decline steeply as the effective size of the photosphere decreases and trapped electromagnetic radiation is depleted.', u'The light curve continues to decline in the B band while it may show a small shoulder in the visual at about 40 days, but this is only a hint of a secondary maximum that occurs in the infra-red as certain ionised heavy elements recombine to produce infra-red radiation and the ejecta become transparent to it.', u'The visual light curve continues to decline at a rate slightly greater than the decay rate of the radioactive cobalt (which has the longer half life and controls the later curve), because the ejected material becomes more diffuse and less able to convert the high energy radiation into visual radiation.', u'After several months, the light curve changes its decline rate again as positron emission becomes dominant from the remaining cobalt-56, although this portion of the light curve has been little-studied.', u'Type Ib and Ic light curves are basically similar to type Ia although with a lower average peak luminosity.', u'The visual light output is again due to radioactive decay being converted into visual radiation, but there is a much lower mass of nickel-56 produced in these types of explosion.', u'The peak luminosity varies considerably and there are even occasional type Ib/c supernovae orders of magnitude more and less luminous than the norm.', u'The most luminous type Ic supernovae are referred to as hypernovae and tend to have broadened light curves in addition to the increased peak luminosity.', u'The source of the extra energy is thought to be relativistic jets driven by the formation of a rotating black hole, which also produce gamma-ray bursts.', u'The light curves for type II supernovae are characterised by a much slower decline than type I, on the order of 0.05 magnitudes per day, excluding the plateau phase.', u'The visual light output is dominated by kinetic energy rather than radioactive decay for several months, due primarily to the existence of hydrogen in the ejecta from the atmosphere of the supergiant progenitor star.', u'In the initial explosion this hydrogen becomes heated and ionised.', u'The majority of type II supernovae show a prolonged plateau in their light curves as this hydrogen recombines, emitting visible light and becoming more transparent.', u'This is then followed by a declining light curve driven by radioactive decay although slower than in type I supernovae, due to the efficiency of conversion into light by all the hydrogen.', u'In type II-L the plateau is absent because the progenitor had relatively little hydrogen left in its atmosphere, sufficient to appear in the spectrum but insufficient to produce a noticeable plateau in the light output.', u'In type IIb supernovae the hydrogen atmosphere of the progenitor is so depleted (thought to be due to tidal stripping by a companion star) that the light curve is closer to a type I supernova and the hydrogen even disappears from the spectrum after several weeks.', u'Type IIn supernovae are characterised by additional narrow spectral lines produced in a dense shell of circumstellar material.', u'Their light curves are generally very broad and extended, occasionally also extremely luminous and referred to as a hypernova.', u'These light curves are produced by the highly efficient conversion of kinetic energy of the ejecta into electromagnetic radiation by interaction with the dense shell of material.', u'This only occurs when the material is sufficiently dense and compact, indicating that it has been produced by the progenitor star itself only shortly before the supernova occurs.', u'Large numbers of supernovae have been catalogued and classified to provide distance candles and test models.', u'Average characteristics vary somewhat with distance and type of host galaxy, but can broadly be specified for each supernova type.', u'Notes:\n\n\n=== Asymmetry ===\n\nA long-standing puzzle surrounding Type II supernovae is why the compact object remaining after the explosion is given a large velocity away from the epicentre; pulsars, and thus neutron stars, are observed to have high velocities, and black holes presumably do as well, although they are far harder to observe in isolation.', u'The initial impetus can be substantial, propelling an object of more than a solar mass at a velocity of 500 km/s or greater.', u'This indicates an asymmetry in the explosion, but the mechanism by which momentum is transferred to the compact object remains a puzzle.', u'Proposed explanations for this kick include convection in the collapsing star and jet production during neutron star formation.', u'One possible explanation for the asymmetry in the explosion is large-scale convection above the core.', u'The convection can create variations in the local abundances of elements, resulting in uneven nuclear burning during the collapse, bounce and resulting explosion.', u'Another possible explanation is that accretion of gas onto the central neutron star can create a disk that drives highly directional jets, propelling matter at a high velocity out of the star, and driving transverse shocks that completely disrupt the star.', u'These jets might play a crucial role in the resulting supernova explosion.', u'(A similar model is now favored for explaining long gamma-ray bursts.)', u'Initial asymmetries have also been confirmed in Type Ia supernova explosions through observation.', u'This result may mean that the initial luminosity of this type of supernova depends on the viewing angle.', u'However, the explosion becomes more symmetrical with the passage of time.', u'Early asymmetries are detectable by measuring the polarization of the emitted light.', u'=== Energy output ===\n\nAlthough we are used to thinking of supernovae primarily as luminous visible events, the electromagnetic radiation they release is almost a minor side-effect of the explosion.', u'Particularly in the case of core collapse supernovae, the emitted electromagnetic radiation is a tiny fraction of the total energy released during the event.', u'There is a fundamental difference between the balance of energy production in the different types of supernova.', u'In type Ia white dwarf detonations, most of the energy is directed into heavy element synthesis and the kinetic energy of the ejecta.', u'In core collapse supernovae, the vast majority of the energy is directed into neutrino emission, and while some of this apparently powers the following main explosion 99%+ of the neutrinos escape the star in the first few minutes following the start of the collapse.', u'Type Ia supernovae derive their energy from a runaway nuclear fusion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf.', u'The details of the energetics are still not fully understood, but the end result is the ejection of the entire mass of the original star at high kinetic energy.', u'Around half a solar mass of that mass is 56Ni generated from silicon burning.', u'56Ni is radioactive and decays into 56Co by beta plus decay (with a half life of six days) and gamma rays.', u'56Co itself decays by the beta plus (an anti-electron) path with a half life of 77 days into stable 56Fe.', u'These two processes are responsible for the electromagnetic radiation from type Ia supernovae.', u'In combination with the changing transparency of the ejected material, they produce the rapidly declining light curve.', u'Core collapse supernovae are on average visually fainter than type Ia supernovae, but the total energy released is far higher.', u'In the case of supernovae, the energy of gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy that compresses and collapses the core, initially producing electron neutrinos from disintegrating nucleons, followed by all flavours of thermal neutrinos from the super-heated neutron star core.', u'Around 1% of these neutrinos are thought to deposit sufficient energy into the outer layers of the star to drive the resulting explosion, but again the details cannot be reproduced exactly in current models.', u'Kinetic energies and nickel yields are somewhat lower than type Ia supernovae, hence the lower visual luminosity of supernovae, but energy from the de-ionisation of the many solar masses of remaining hydrogen can contribute to a much slower decline in luminosity and produce the plateau phase seen in the majority of core collapse supernovae.', u'In some core collapse supernovae, fallback onto a black hole drives relativistic jets which may produce a brief energetic and directional burst of gamma rays and also transfers substantial further energy into the ejected material.', u'This is one scenario for producing high luminosity supernovae and is thought to be the cause of type Ic hypernovae and long duration gamma-ray bursts.', u'If the relativistic jets are too brief and fail to penetrate the stellar envelope then a low luminosity gamma-ray burst may be produced and the supernova may be sub-luminous.', u'When a supernova occurs inside a small dense cloud of circumstellar material, it will produce a shock wave that can efficiently convert a high fraction of the kinetic energy into electromagnetic radiation.', u'Even though the initial explosion energy was entirely normal the resulting supernova will have high luminosity and extended duration since it does not rely on exponential radioactive decay.', u'This type of event may cause type IIn hypernovae.', u'Although pair-instability supernovae are core collapse supernovae with spectra and light curves similar to type II-P, the nature of that explosion following core collapse is more like that of a giant type Ia with runaway fusion of carbon, oxygen, and silicon.', u'The total energy released by the highest mass events is comparable to other core collapse supernovae but neutrino production is thought to be very low, hence the kinetic and electromagnetic energy released is very high.', u'The cores of these stars are much larger than any white dwarf and the amount of radioactive nickel and other heavy elements ejected from their cores can be orders of magnitude higher, with consequently high visual luminosity.', u'=== Progenitor ===\n\nThe supernova classification type is closely tied to the type of star at the time of the explosion.', u'The occurrence of each type of supernova depends dramatically on the metallicity and hence the age of the host galaxy.', u'Type Ia supernovae are produced from white dwarf stars in binary systems and occur in all galaxy types.', u'Core collapse supernovae are only found in galaxies undergoing current or very recent star formation, since they result from short-lived massive stars.', u'They are most commonly found in type Sc spirals, but also in the arms of other spiral galaxies and in irregular galaxies, especially starburst galaxies.', u'Type Ib/c and II-L, and possibly most type IIn, supernovae are only thought to be produced from stars having near-solar metallicity levels that result in high mass loss from massive stars, hence they are less common in older more distant galaxies.', u'The table shows the expected progenitor for the main types of core collapse supernova, and the approximate proportions of each in the local neighbourhood.', u'There are a number of difficulties reconciling modelled and observed stellar evolution leading up to core collapse supernovae.', u'Red supergiants are the expected progenitors for the vast majority of core collapse supernovae, and these have been observed but only at relatively low masses and luminosities, below about 18 M\u2609 and 100,000 L\u2609 respectively.', u'Most progenitors of type II supernovae are not detected and must be considerably fainter, and presumably less massive.', u'It is now proposed that higher mass red supergiants do not explode as supernovae, but instead evolve back towards hotter temperatures.', u'Several progenitors of type IIb supernovae have been confirmed, and these were K and G supergiants, plus one A supergiant.', u'Yellow hypergiants or LBVs are proposed progenitors for type IIb supernovae, and almost all type IIb supernovae near enough to observe have shown such progenitors.', u'Until just a few decades ago, hot supergiants were not considered likely to explode, but observations have shown otherwise.', u'Blue supergiants form an unexpectedly high proportion of confirmed supernova progenitors, partly due to their high luminosity and easy detection, while not a single Wolf-Rayet progenitor has yet been clearly identified.', u'Models have had difficulty showing how blue supergiants lose enough mass to reach supernova without progressing to a different evolutionary stage.', u'One study has shown a possible route for low-luminosity post-red supergiant luminous blue variables to collapse, most likely as a type IIn supernova.', u'The expected progenitors of type Ib supernovae, luminous WC stars, are not observed at all.', u'Instead WC stars are found at lower luminosities, apparently post-red supergiant stars.', u'WO stars are extremely rare and visually relatively faint, so it is difficult to say whether such progenitors are missing or just yet to be observed.', u'Very luminous progenitors, despite numerous supernovae being observed near enough that such progenitors would have been clearly imaged.', u'Several examples of hot luminous progenitors of type IIn supernovae have been detected: SN 2005gy and SN 2010jl were both apparently massive luminous stars, but are very distant; and SN 2009ip had a highly luminous progenitor likely to have been an LBV, but is a peculiar supernova whose exact nature is disupted.', u'== Interstellar impact ==\n\n\n=== Source of heavy elements ===\n\nSupernovae are the major source of elements heavier than oxygen.', u'These elements are produced by nuclear fusion for nuclei up to 34S, by silicon photodisintegration rearrangement and quasiequilibrium (see Supernova nucleosynthesis) during silicon burning for nuclei between 36Ar and 56Ni, and by rapid captures of neutrons during the supernova explosion for elements heavier than iron.', u'Nucleosynthesis during silicon burning yields nuclei roughly 1000-100,000 times more abundant than the r-process isotopes heavier than iron.', u'Supernovae are the most likely, although not undisputed, candidate sites for the r-process, which is the rapid capture of neutrons that occurs at high temperature and high density of neutrons.', u'Those reactions produce highly unstable nuclei that are rich in neutrons and that rapidly beta decay into more stable forms.', u'The r-process produces about half of all the heavier isotopes of the elements beyond iron, including plutonium and uranium.', u'The only other major competing process for producing elements heavier than iron is the s-process in large, old, red-giant AGB stars, which produces these elements slowly over longer epochs and which cannot produce elements heavier than lead.', u'=== Role in stellar evolution ===\n\nThe remnant of a supernova explosion consists of a compact object and a rapidly expanding shock wave of material.', u'This cloud of material sweeps up the surrounding interstellar medium during a free expansion phase, which can last for up to two centuries.', u'The wave then gradually undergoes a period of adiabatic expansion, and will slowly cool and mix with the surrounding interstellar medium over a period of about 10,000 years.', u'The Big Bang produced hydrogen, helium, and traces of lithium, while all heavier elements are synthesized in stars and supernovae.', u'Supernovae tend to enrich the surrounding interstellar medium with metals\u2014elements other than hydrogen and helium.', u'These injected elements ultimately enrich the molecular clouds that are the sites of star formation.', u'Thus, each stellar generation has a slightly different composition, going from an almost pure mixture of hydrogen and helium to a more metal-rich composition.', u'Supernovae are the dominant mechanism for distributing these heavier elements, which are formed in a star during its period of nuclear fusion.', u"The different abundances of elements in the material that forms a star have important influences on the star's life, and may decisively influence the possibility of having planets orbiting it.", u'The kinetic energy of an expanding supernova remnant can trigger star formation due to compression of nearby, dense molecular clouds in space.', u'The increase in turbulent pressure can also prevent star formation if the cloud is unable to lose the excess energy.', u'Evidence from daughter products of short-lived radioactive isotopes shows that a nearby supernova helped determine the composition of the Solar System 4.5 billion years ago, and may even have triggered the formation of this system.', u'Supernova production of heavy elements over astronomic periods of time ultimately made the chemistry of life on Earth possible.', u'=== Effect on Earth ===\n\nA near-Earth supernova is a supernova close enough to the Earth to have noticeable effects on its biosphere.', u'Depending upon the type and energy of the supernova, it could be as far as 3000 light-years away.', u'Gamma rays from a supernova would induce a chemical reaction in the upper atmosphere converting molecular nitrogen into nitrogen oxides, depleting the ozone layer enough to expose the surface to harmful solar radiation.', u'This has been proposed as the cause of the Ordovician\u2013Silurian extinction, which resulted in the death of nearly 60% of the oceanic life on Earth.', u'In 1996 it was theorized that traces of past supernovae might be detectable on Earth in the form of metal isotope signatures in rock strata.', u'Iron-60 enrichment was later reported in deep-sea rock of the Pacific Ocean.', u'In 2009, elevated levels of nitrate ions were found in Antarctic ice, which coincided with the 1006 and 1054 supernovae.', u'Gamma rays from these supernovae could have boosted levels of nitrogen oxides, which became trapped in the ice.', u'Type Ia supernovae are thought to be potentially the most dangerous if they occur close enough to the Earth.', u'Because these supernovae arise from dim, common white dwarf stars in binary systems, it is likely that a supernova that can affect the Earth will occur unpredictably and in a star system that is not well studied.', u'The closest known candidate is IK Pegasi (see below).', u"Recent estimates predict that a Type II supernova would have to be closer than eight parsecs (26 light-years) to destroy half of the Earth's ozone layer, and there are no such candidates closer than about 500 light years.", u'== Milky Way candidates ==\n\nThe next supernova in the Milky Way will likely be detectable even if it occurs on the far side of the galaxy.', u'It is likely to be produced by the collapse of an unremarkable red supergiant and it is very probable that it will already have been catalogued in infrared surveys such as 2MASS.', u'There is a smaller chance that the next core collapse supernova will be produced by a different type of massive star such as a yellow hypergiant, luminous blue variable, or Wolf-Rayet.', u'The chances of the next supernova being a type Ia produced by a white dwarf are calculated to be about a third of those for a core collapse supernova.', u'Again it should be observable wherever it occurs, but it is less likely that the progenitor will ever have been observed prior to the explosion.', u"It isn't even known exactly what a type Ia progenitor system looks like, and difficult to detect them beyond a few parsecs.", u"The total supernova rate in our galaxy is estimated to be about 4.6 per century, or one every 22 years, although we haven't actually observed one for several centuries.", u'Statistically, the next supernova is likely to be produced from an otherwise unremarkable red supergiant, but it is difficult to identify which of those supergiants are in the final stages of heavy element fusion in their cores and which have millions of years left.', u'The most massive red supergiants are expected to shed their atmospheres and evolve to Wolf-Rayet stars before their cores collapse.', u'All Wolf-Rayet stars are expected to end their lives from the Wolf-Rayet phase within a million years or so, but again it is difficult to identify those that are closest to core collapse.', u'One class that is expected to have no more than a few thousand years before exploding are the WO Wolf-Rayet stars, which are known to have exhausted their core helium.', u'Only eight of them are known, and only four of those are in the Milky Way.', u'A number of close or well known stars have been identified as possible core collapse supernova candidates: the red supergiants Antares and Betelgeuze; the yellow hypergiant Rho Cassiopeiae; the luminous blue variable Eta Carinae that has already produced a supernova imposter explosion; and the brightest component, a Wolf\u2013Rayet star in the Regor or Gamma Velorum system, Others have gained notoriety as possible, although not very likely, progenitors for a gamma-ray burst; for example WR 104.', u'Identification of candidates for a type Ia supernova explosion is much more speculative.', u'Any binary with an accreting white dwarf might produce a supernova although the exact mechanism and timescale is still debated.', u'These systems are faint and difficult to identify, but the novae and recurrent novae are such systems that conveniently advertise themselves.', u'One examples is U Scorpii, The nearest known type Ia supernova candidate is IK Pegasi (HR 8210), located at a distance of 150 light-years, but observations suggest it will be several million years before the white dwarf can accrete the critical mass required to become a Type Ia supernova.', u'== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n"Introduction to Supernova Remnants".', u'NASA/GSFC.', u'2007-10-04.', u'Retrieved

Hart phrased it.', u'Roosevelt did so on the assurance from financial experts that Japan had been drained from the Russo-Japanese War and would not be ready for another conflict for at least a decade.', u'After the fleet had crossed the Pacific, Japanese statesmen realized that the balance of power in the East had changed since the Root\u2013Takahira Agreement that defined relevant spheres of interest of the United States and Japan.', u'The voyage also provided an opportunity to improve the sea- and battle-worthiness of the fleet.', u'While earlier capital ship classes such as the Kearsarge, Illinois and Maine were designed primarily for coastal defense, later classes such as the Virginia and Connecticut incorporated lessons learned from the Spanish\u2013American War and were conceived as ships with "the highest practicable speed and the greatest radius of action", in the words of the appropriation bills approved by the United States Congress for their construction.', u'They were intended as modern warships capable of long-range operations.', u'Nevertheless, the experience gained in the recent war with Spain had been limited.', u"== Concerns and preparations ==\nRoosevelt's stated intent was to give the navy practice in navigation, communication, coal consumption and fleet maneuvering; navy professionals maintained, however, that such matters could be served better in home waters.", u'In light of what had happened to the Russian Baltic Fleet, they were concerned about sending their own fleet on a long deployment, especially since part of the intent was to impress a modern, battle-tested navy that had not known defeat.', u'The fleet was untested in making such a voyage, and Tsushima had proven that extended deployments had no place in practical strategy.', u'The Japanese navy was close to coaling and repair facilities; while American ships could coal in the Philippines, docking facilities were far from optimal.', u'An extended stop on the West Coast of the United States during the voyage for overhaul and refurbishment in dry dock would be a necessity.', u'Planning for the voyage, however, showed a dearth of adequate facilities there, as well.', u'The main sea channel of the Mare Island Navy Yard near San Francisco was too shallow for battleships, which left only the Puget Sound Navy Yard in Bremerton, Washington for refit and repair.', u"The Hunter's Point civilian yard in San Francisco could accommodate capital ships but had been closed due to lack of use and was slated for demolition.", u"President Roosevelt ordered that Hunter's Point be reopened, facilities be brought up to date and the fleet to report there.", u'There was also the question of adequate resources for coaling.', u'This was not an issue when the Atlantic Fleet cruised the Atlantic or Caribbean, as fuel supplies were readily available.', u'However, the United States did not enjoy a worldwide network of coaling stations like that of Great Britain, nor did it have an adequate supply of auxiliary vessels for resupply.', u'During the Spanish\u2013American War, this lack had forced Admiral George Dewey to buy a collier-load of British coal in Hong Kong before the Battle of Manila Bay to ensure his squadron would not be stranded at sea.', u'The need had been even more pressing for the Russian Baltic Fleet during its long deployment during the Russo-Japanese War, not just for the distance it was to sail but also because, as a belligerent nation in wartime, most neutral ports were closed to it due to international law.', u'While the lack of support vessels was pointed out and a vigorous program of building such ships suggested by Rear Admiral George W. Melville, who had served as chief of the Bureau of Equipment, his words were not heeded adequately until World War II.', u'Federal regulations that restricted resupply vessels for Navy ships to those flying the United States flag, complicated by the lack of an adequate American merchant marine, proved another obstacle.', u'Roosevelt initially offered to award Navy supply contracts to American skippers whose bids exceeded those of foreign captains by less than 50 percent.', u'Many carriers declined this offer due to the fact that they could not obtain enough cargo to cover the cost of the return trip.', u'Two months before the fleet sailed, Roosevelt ordered the Navy Department to contract 38 ships to supply the fleet with the 125,000 tons of coal it would need to steam from Hampton Roads, Virginia to San Francisco.', u'Only eight of these were American-registered;

Burns, was involved in the Teapot Dome scandal.', u'When Hoover took over the Bureau of Investigation, it had approximately 650 employees, including 441 Special Agents.', u'Hoover was sometimes unpredictable in his leadership.', u'He frequently fired Bureau agents, singling out those he thought "looked stupid like truck drivers," or whom he considered "pinheads."', u'He also relocated agents who had displeased him to career-ending assignments and locations; Melvin Purvis was a prime example.', u'Purvis was one of the most effective agents in capturing and breaking up 1930s gangs, and it is alleged that Hoover maneuvered him out of the Bureau because Hoover was jealous of the substantial public recognition Purvis received.', u'Hoover often hailed local law-enforcement officers around the country, and built up a national network of supporters and admirers in the process.', u'One whom he often commended for particular effectiveness was the conservative sheriff of Caddo Parish, Louisiana, J. Howell Flournoy.', u'=== Gangster wars ===\n\nIn the early 1930s, criminal gangs carried out large numbers of bank robberies in the Midwest.', u'They used their superior firepower and fast getaway cars to elude local law enforcement agencies and avoid arrest.', u'Many of these criminals frequently made newspaper headlines across the United States, particularly John Dillinger, who became famous for leaping over bank cages, and repeatedly escaping from jails and police traps.', u'The gangsters enjoyed a level of sympathy in the Midwest, as banks and bankers were widely seen as oppressors of common people during the Great Depression.', u'The robbers operated across state lines, and Hoover pressed to have their crimes recognized as federal offenses so that he and his men would have the authority to pursue them and get the credit for capturing them.', u'Initially, the Bureau suffered some embarrassing foul-ups, in particular with Dillinger and his conspirators.', u'A raid on a summer lodge in Manitowish Waters, Wisconsin, called "Little Bohemia", left a Bureau agent and a civilian bystander dead and others wounded; all the gangsters escaped.', u'Hoover realized that his job was then on the line, and he pulled out all stops to capture the culprits.', u"In late July 1934, Special Agent Melvin Purvis, the Director of Operations in the Chicago office, received a tip on Dillinger's whereabouts that paid off when Dillinger was located, ambushed, and killed by Bureau agents outside the Biograph Theater.", u'In the same period, there were numerous Mafia shootings as a result of Prohibition, while Hoover continued to deny the very existence of organized crime.', u'Gangster Frank Costello helped encourage this view by feeding Hoover tips on sure winners through their mutual friend, gossip columnist Walter Winchell.', u'(Hoover had a reputation as "an inveterate horseplayer" known to send Special Agents to place $100 bets for him.)', u'Hoover said the Bureau had "much more important functions" than arresting bookmakers and gamblers.', u'Hoover was credited with several highly publicized captures or shootings of outlaws and bank robbers, even though he was not present at the events.', u"These included those of Machine Gun Kelly in 1933, of Dillinger in 1934, and of Alvin Karpis in 1936, which led to the Bureau's powers being broadened.", u'In 1935, the Bureau was renamed the Federal Bureau of Investigation.', u"In 1939, the FBI became pre-eminent in the field of domestic intelligence, thanks in large part to changes made by Hoover, such as expanding and combining fingerprint files in the Identification Division, to compile the largest collection of fingerprints to date, and Hoover's help to expand the FBI's recruitment and create the FBI Laboratory, a division established in 1932 to examine and analyze evidence found by the FBI.", u'=== Investigation of subversion and radicals ===\n\nHoover was concerned about what he claimed was subversion, and under his leadership, the FBI investigated tens of thousands of suspected subversives and radicals.', u'According to critics, Hoover tended to exaggerate the dangers of these alleged subversives and many times overstepped his bounds in his pursuit of eliminating that perceived threat.', u'William G. Hundley, a Justice Department prosecutor, said Hoover may have inadvertently kept alive the concern over communist infiltration into the government because Hoover\'s "informants were nearly the only ones that paid the party dues."', u'The FBI investigated rings of German saboteurs and spies starting in the late 1930s, and had primary responsibility for counterespionage.', u'The first arrests of German agents were made in 1938 and continued throughout World War II.', u'In the Quirin affair, during World War II, German U-boats set two small groups of Nazi agents ashore in Florida and Long Island to cause acts of sabotage within the country.', u'The two teams were apprehended after one of the men contacted the FBI and told them everything.', u'He was also charged and convicted.', u'During the war and for many years afterward, the FBI maintained a fictionalized version of the story in which it had preempted and caught the saboteurs solely by its own investigations and had even infiltrated the German government.', u'This story was useful during the war to discourage the Germans by making the FBI seem more invincible than it really was and perhaps afterward to similarly mislead the Soviets; but it also served Hoover in his efforts to maintain a superhero-style image for the FBI in American minds.', u'During this time period President Roosevelt, out of concern over Nazi agents in the United States, gave "qualified permission" to wiretap persons "suspected... [of] subversive activities".', u'He went on to add, in 1941, that the United States Attorney General had to be informed of its use in each case.', u'The Attorney General Robert H. Jackson left it to Hoover to decide how and when to use wiretaps, as he found the "whole business" distasteful.', u"Jackson's successor at the post of Attorney General, Francis Biddle, did turn down Hoover's requests on occasion.", u'The FBI participated in the Venona Project, a pre\u2013World War II joint project with the British to eavesdrop on Soviet spies in the UK and the United States.', u'They did not initially realize that espionage was being committed, but Soviet multiple use of one-time pad ciphers, which are normally unbreakable, created redundancies.', u'This let some intercepts be decoded, which established the espionage.', u"Hoover kept the intercepts\u2014America's greatest counterintelligence secret\u2014in a locked safe in his office, choosing not to inform President Truman, Attorney General J. Howard McGrath, or two Secretaries of State\u2014Dean Acheson and General George Marshall\u2014while they held office.", u'He informed the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the Venona Project in 1952.', u'In 1946, Attorney General Tom C. Clark authorized Hoover to compile a list of potentially disloyal Americans who might be detained during a wartime national emergency.', u'In 1950, at the outbreak of the Korean War, Hoover submitted to President Truman a plan to suspend the writ of habeas corpus and detain 12,000 Americans suspected of disloyalty.', u'Truman did not act on the plan.', u"=== COINTELPRO and the 1950s ===\n\nIn 1956, Hoover was becoming increasingly frustrated by U.S. Supreme Court decisions that limited the Justice Department's ability to prosecute people for their political opinions, most notably communists.", u'Some of his aides reported that he purposely exaggerated the threat of communism to "ensure financial and public support for the FBI."', u'At this time he formalized a covert "dirty tricks" program under the name COINTELPRO.', u'This program remained in place until it was revealed to the public in 1971, after the theft of many internal documents from an office in Media, Pennsylvania, and COINTELPRO became the cause of some of the harshest criticism of Hoover and the FBI.', u"COINTELPRO was first used to disrupt the Communist Party USA, where Hoover went after targets that ranged from suspected everyday spies to larger celebrity figures such as Charlie Chaplin, he saw as spreading Communist Party propaganda, and later organizations such as the Black Panther Party, Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and others.", u"COINTELPRO's methods included infiltration, burglaries, illegal wiretaps, planting forged documents, and spreading false rumors about key members of target organizations.", u'Some authors have charged that COINTELPRO methods also included inciting violence and arranging murders.', u'In 1975, COINTELPRO\'s activities were investigated by the United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, called the "Church Committee" after its chairman, Senator Frank Church (D-Idaho); the committee declared COINTELPRO\'s activities were illegal and contrary to the Constitution.', u'Hoover amassed significant power by collecting files containing large amounts of compromising and potentially embarrassing information on many powerful people, especially politicians.', u'According to Laurence Silberman, appointed Deputy Attorney General in early 1974, FBI Director Clarence M. Kelley thought such files either did not exist or had been destroyed.', u'After The Washington Post broke a story in January 1975, Kelley searched and found them in his outer office.', u'The House Judiciary Committee then demanded that Silberman testify about them.', u'In 1956, several years before he targeted King, Hoover had a public showdown with T. R. M. Howard, a civil rights leader from Mound Bayou, Mississippi.', u"During a national speaking tour, Howard had criticized the FBI's failure to thoroughly investigate the racially motivated murders of George W. Lee, Lamar Smith, and Emmett Till.", u'Hoover wrote an open letter to the press singling out these statements as "irresponsible".', u'=== Response to Mafia and civil rights groups ===\n\nWhile Hoover had fought bank-robbing gangsters in the 1930s, anti-communism was a bigger focus for him after World War II, as the Cold War developed.', u'During the 1940s through mid-1950s, he seemed to ignore organized crime of the type that ran vice rackets such as drugs, prostitution, and extortion.', u'He denied that any Mafia operated in the U.S.', u"In the 1950s, evidence of Hoover's unwillingness to focus FBI resources on the Mafia became grist for the media and his many detractors.", u'The Apalachin Meeting of late 1957 embarrassed the FBI by proving on newspaper front pages that a nationwide Mafia syndicate thrived unimpeded by the nation\'s "top cops".', u'Hoover immediately changed tack, and during the next five years, the FBI investigated organized crime heavily.', u'Its concentration on the topic fluctuated in subsequent decades, but it never again merely ignored this category of crime.', u"Hoover's moves against people who maintained contacts with subversive elements, some of whom were members of the civil rights movement, also led to accusations of trying to undermine their reputations.", u'The treatment of Martin Luther King, Jr. and actress Jean Seberg are two examples.', u"Jacqueline Kennedy recalled that Hoover told President John F. Kennedy that King tried to arrange a sex party while in the capital for the March on Washington and told Robert Kennedy that King made derogatory comments during the President's funeral.", u"However, King aide Andrew Young later claimed in a 2013 interview with the Academy of Achievement that the main source of tension between the SCLC and FBI was the government agency's lack of black agents and that both parties were willing to cooperate with each other by the time the Selma to Montgomery marches had taken place.", u'Hoover personally directed the FBI investigation of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.', u'In 1964, just days before Hoover testified in the earliest stages of the Warren Commission hearings, President Lyndon B. Johnson waived the then-mandatory U.S. Government Service Retirement Age of 70, allowing Hoover to remain the FBI Director "for an indefinite period of time."', u'The House Select Committee on Assassinations issued a report in 1979 critical of the performance by the FBI, the Warren Commission, and other agencies.', u"The report also criticized what it characterized as the FBI's reluctance to thoroughly investigate the possibility of a conspiracy to assassinate the President.", u'=== Late career ===\n\nPresidents Harry S Truman and John F. Kennedy each considered dismissing Hoover as FBI Director, but ultimately concluded that the political cost of doing so would be too great.', u"In 1964, Hoover's FBI investigated Jack Valenti, a special assistant and confidant of President Lyndon Johnson's.", u"Despite Valenti's two-year marriage to Johnson's personal secretary, the investigation focused on rumors that he was having a gay relationship with a commercial photographer friend.", u'When Richard Nixon took office in January 1969, Hoover had just turned 74.', u"There was a growing sentiment in Washington, DC that the aging FBI chief needed to go, but Hoover's power and friends in Congress remained too strong for him to be forced into retirement.", u'== Pets ==\nHoover received his first dog from his parents when he was a child, after which he was never without one.', u'He owned many throughout his lifetime and became an aficionado especially knowledgeable in fine breeding of pedigrees, particularly Cairn Terriers and Beagles.', u'He gave away many dogs to notable people, such as Presidents Herbert Hoover (no relation) and Lyndon B. Johnson, and buried seven canine pets, including a Cairn Terrier named Spee De Bozo, at Aspen Hill Memorial Park, in Silver Spring, Maryland.', u'== Death ==\nHoover remained director of the FBI until he died in his Washington home of a heart attack, on May 2, 1972.', u'His body lay in state in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol, where Chief Justice Warren Burger eulogized him.', u'President Richard Nixon delivered another eulogy at the funeral service in the National Presbyterian Church, and called Hoover "one of the giants[, whose] long life brimmed over with magnificent achievement and dedicated service to this country which he loved so well."', u'Hoover was buried in the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C., next to the graves of his parents and a sister who died in infancy.', u'== Successor ==\nOperational command of the Bureau passed to Associate Director Clyde Tolson.', u'On May 3, Nixon appointed L. Patrick Gray, a Justice Department official with no FBI experience, as Acting Director, with W. Mark Felt remaining as Associate Director.', u'== Legacy ==\nBiographer Kenneth D. Ackerman notes: "For better or worse, he built the FBI into a modern, national organization stressing professionalism and scientific crime-fighting.', u'For most of his life, Americans considered him a hero.', u'He made the G-Man brand so popular that, at its height, it was harder to become an FBI agent than to be accepted into an Ivy League college."', u"Hoover was a consultant to Warner Bros. for a theatrical film about the FBI, The FBI Story (1959), and in 1965 on Warner Bros.' long-running spin-off television series, The F.B.I.", u'Hoover personally made sure Warner Bros. portrayed the FBI more favorably than other crime dramas of the times.', u'In 1979, there was a large increase in conflict in the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) under Senator Richard Schweiker, which had re-opened the investigation of the assassination of President Kennedy and reported that Hoover\'s FBI "failed to investigate adequately the possibility of a conspiracy to assassinate the President".', u'The HSCA further reported that Hoover\'s FBI "was deficient in its sharing of information with other agencies and departments".', u"Because Hoover's actions came to be seen as abuses of power, FBI directors are now limited to one 10-year term, subject to extension by the United States Senate.", u'The FBI Headquarters in Washington, DC is named the J. Edgar Hoover Building, after Hoover.', u"Because of the controversial nature of Hoover's legacy, there have been periodic proposals to rename it by legislation proposed by both Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate.", u"For example, in 2001, Senator Harry Reid sponsored an amendment to strip Hoover's name from the building.", u'"J. Edgar Hoover\'s name on the FBI building is a stain on the building", Reid said.', u'The Senate did not adopt the amendment.', u"Hoover's practice of violating civil liberties for the sake of national security has been questioned in reference to recent national surveillance programs.", u'An example is a lecture titled "Civil Liberties and National Security: Did Hoover Get it Right?', u'", given at The Institute of World Politics on April 21, 2015.', u'== Sexuality ==\n\nSince the 1940s, rumors had circulated that Hoover was homosexual.', u"The historians John Stuart Cox and Athan G. Theoharis speculated that Clyde Tolson, who became an associate director of the FBI and Hoover's primary heir, may have been his lover.", u'Hoover reportedly hunted down and threatened anyone who made insinuations about his sexuality.', u'Some associates and scholars dismiss rumors about Hoover\'s sexuality, and his relationship with Tolson in particular, as unlikely, while others have described them as probable or even "confirmed".', u'Still other scholars have reported the rumors without expressing an opinion.', u'Hoover described Tolson as his alter ego: the men worked closely together during the day and, both single, frequently took meals, went to night clubs, and vacationed together.', u'This closeness between the two men is often cited as evidence that they were lovers, though some FBI employees who knew them, such as W. Mark Felt, say the relationship was "brotherly".', u"The former FBI official Mike Mason suggested that some of Hoover's colleagues denied that he had a sexual relationship with Tolson in an effort to protect Hoover's image.", u"Hoover bequeathed his estate to Tolson, who moved into Hoover's house after Hoover died.", u"Tolson accepted the American flag that draped Hoover's casket.", u'Tolson is buried a few yards away from Hoover in the Congressional Cemetery.', u"Hoover's biographer Richard Hack does not believe the director was gay.", u"Hack notes that Hoover was romantically linked to actress Dorothy Lamour in the late 1930s and early 1940s, and that after Hoover's death, Lamour did not deny rumors that she had had an affair with him in the years between her two marriages.", u'Hack further reported that, during the 1940s and 1950s, Hoover attended social events with Lela Rogers, the divorced mother of dancer and actress Ginger Rogers, so often that many of their mutual friends assumed the pair would eventually marry.', u'In his biography Official and Confidential: The Secret Life of J. Edgar Hoover (1993), the journalist Anthony Summers quoted "society divorcee" Susan Rosenstiel as claiming to have seen Hoover engaging in cross-dressing in the 1950s, at homosexual parties.', u'Summers also said the Mafia had blackmail material on Hoover, which made Hoover reluctant to pursue organized crime aggressively.', u"According to Summers, top organized crime figures Meyer Lansky and Frank Costello obtained photos of Hoover's alleged homosexual activity with Tolson and used them to ensure that the FBI did not target their illegal activities.", u'Additionally, Summers claimed that Hoover was friends with Billy Byars, Jr., an alleged child pornographer and producer of the film The Genesis Children.', u"Another Hoover biographer who heard the rumors of homosexuality and blackmail, however, said he was unable to corroborate them, though it has been acknowledged that Lansky and other organized crime figures had frequently been allowed to visit the Del Charro Hotel in La Jolla, California, which was owned by Hoover's friend, and staunch Lyndon Johnson supporter, Clint Murchison.", u'Hoover and Tolson would frequently visit the Del Charro Hotel as well.', u'Summers quoted a source named Charles Krebs as saying, "On three occasions that I knew about, maybe four, boys were driven down to La Jolla at Hoover\'s request."', u'Although never corroborated, the allegation of cross-dressing has been widely repeated.', u'In the words of author Thomas Doherty, "For American popular culture, the image of the zaftig FBI director as a Christine Jorgensen wanna-be was too delicious not to savor."', u'Biographer Kenneth Ackerman contends that Summers\' accusations have been "widely debunked by historians."', u"Skeptics of the cross-dressing story point to Susan Rosenstiel's poor credibility (she pleaded guilty to attempted perjury in a 1971 case and later served time in a New York City jail).", u'Recklessly indiscreet behavior by Hoover would have been totally out of character, whatever his sexuality.', u"Most biographers consider the story of Mafia blackmail unlikely in light of the FBI's investigations of the Mafia.", u'Truman Capote, who helped spread salacious rumors about Hoover, once remarked that he was more interested in making Hoover angry than determining whether the rumors were true.', u"The attorney Roy Cohn, who served as general counsel on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations during Senator Joseph McCarthy's tenure as chairman and assisted Hoover during the 1950s investigations of Communists\u2014and who was generally known to be a closeted homosexual\u2014opined that Hoover was too frightened of his own sexuality to have anything approaching a normal sexual or romantic relationship.", u'During the Lavender Scare, Cohn and McCarthy further enhanced anti-Communist fervor by suggesting that Communists overseas had convinced several closeted homosexuals within the U.S. government to leak important government information in exchange for the assurance that their sexual identity would remain a secret.', u'A federal investigation that followed convinced President Dwight D. Eisenhower to sign an Executive Order on April 29, 1953, that barred homosexuals from obtaining jobs at the federal level.', u'In his 2004 study of the event, historian David K. Johnson attacked the speculations about Hoover\'s homosexuality as relying on "the kind of tactics Hoover and the security program he oversaw perfected\u2014guilt by association, rumor, and unverified gossip."', u'He views Rosenstiel as a liar who was paid for her story, whose "description of Hoover in drag engaging in sex with young blond boys in leather while desecrating the Bible is clearly a homophobic fantasy."', u'He believes only those who have forgotten the virulence of the decades-long campaign against homosexuals in government can believe reports that Hoover appeared in compromising situations.', u'Some people associated with Hoover have supported the rumors about his homosexual tendencies.', u'Actress and singer Ethel Merman, who was a friend of Hoover\'s since 1938, said in a 1978 interview, "Some of my best friends are homosexual.', u'Everybody knew about J. Edgar Hoover, but he was the best chief the FBI ever had."', u"According to Anthony Summers, Hoover often frequented New York City's Stork Club.", u'Luisa Stuart, a model who was 18 or 19 at the time, told Summers that she had seen Hoover holding hands with Tolson as they all rode in a limo uptown to the Cotton Club in 1936.', u"The novelist William Styron told Summers that he once saw Hoover and Tolson in a California beach house, where the director was painting his friend's toenails.", u'Harry Hay, founder of the Mattachine Society, one of the first gay rights organizations, said Hoover and Tolson sat in boxes owned by and used exclusively by gay men at the Del Mar racetrack in California.', u'One medical expert told Summers that Hoover was of "strongly predominant homosexual orientation," while another medical expert categorized him as a "bisexual with failed heterosexuality."', u'Cox and Theoraris also alleged that "the strange likelihood is that Hoover never knew sexual desire at all."', u'== Honors ==\n1938: Oklahoma Baptist University awarded Hoover an honorary doctorate during commencement exercises, at which he spoke.', u'1939: the National Academy of Sciences awarded Hoover its Public Welfare Medal.', u'1950: King George VI of the United Kingdom awarded Hoover an honorary knighthood in the Order of the British Empire.', u'1955: President Dwight Eisenhower gave Hoover the National Security Medal.', u"1966: President Lyndon B.

husband's aunts to refuse to even acknowledge du Barry, but some saw this as a political blunder that jeopardised Austria's interests at the French court.", u"However, Marie Antoinette's mother and the Austrian ambassador to France, comte de Mercy-Argenteau who was sending the Empress secret reports on Marie-Antoinette's behavior, put Marie Antoinette under pressure and she grudgingly agreed to speak to Madame du Barry on New Year's Day 1772.", u'She only said "there are a lot of people at Versailles today", but Madame du Barry was satisfied by this victory and the crisis passed.', u'Two days after the death of Louis XV in 1774, Louis XVI exiled Madame du Barry to the Abbaye de Pont-aux-Dames in Meaux, pleasing his wife and aunts.', u"Two and a half years later, at the end of October 1776, Madame du Barry's exile ended and she was allowed to return to her beloved chateau at Louveciennes, but she was never permitted to return to Versailles.", u'== Queen of France (1774\u201391) ==\n\n\n=== Early years (1774\u201378) ===\nUpon the death of Louis XV on 10 May 1774, the Dauphin ascended the throne as King Louis XVI of France and Navarre, and Marie Antoinette became Queen of France and Navarre.', u'At the outset, the new queen had limited political influence with her husband, who with the support of his two most important ministers, Chief Minister Maurepas and Foreign Minister Vergennes, blocked several of her candidates from taking important positions, including Choiseul,.', u"However, the queen did play a decisive role in the disgrace and exile of the most powerful of Louis XV's ministers, the Duke of Aiguillon.", u'On 24 May 1774, two weeks after the death of Louis XV, her husband gave her an estate, the Petit Trianon, and free rein to renovate it; soon rumours circulated that she plastered the walls with gold and diamonds.', u'The queen spent heavily on fashion, luxuries and gambling, though the country was facing a grave financial crisis and the population suffering.', u'For her, Rose Bertin created dresses, hair styles such as poufs up to three feet (90 cm) high and the panache (bundle of feathers).', u'She and her court also adopted the English fashion of dresses made of indienne (a material banned in France from 1686 until 1759), percale and muslin.', u'By the time of the Flour War of 1775, a series of riots against the high price of flour and bread, her reputation among the general public was no better than that of the favourites of the previous kings.', u'As early as 1774, Marie Antoinette began to befriend a few male admirers, such as the baron de Besenval, the duc de Coigny, and the Count Valentin Esterh\xe1zy., and formed deep friendships with various ladies at court.', u'Most noted was Marie-Louise, princesse de Lamballe, related to the royal family through her marriage into the Penthi\xe8vre family.', u'On 19 September 1774, she appointed her Superintendent of her Household, a charge she soon gave to her new favourite, the duchesse de Polignac.', u'In 1774, she took under her patronage her former music teacher, the German composer of operas Christoph Willibald Gluck, who remained in France until 1779.', u'=== Motherhood, changes at court, intervention in politics (1778\u201381) ===\n\nAmidst the atmosphere of a wave of libelles, the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph came to France incognito, under the name comte de Falkenstein, for a six-week visit during which he toured Paris extensively and was a guest at Versailles.', u"He met his sister and her husband on 18 April 1777 at the ch\xe2teau de la Muette, and spoke frankly to his brother-in-law, curious as to why the royal marriage had not been consummated, arriving at the conclusion that no obstacle to the couple's conjugal relations existed, save the queen's lack of interest and the king's unwillingness to exert himself in that arena.", u'In a letter to his brother Leopold, Joseph graphically described them as "a couple of complete blunderers."', u"Due to Joseph's intervention, the marriage was finally consummated in August 1777.", u'Eight months later, in April 1778, it was suspected that the queen was pregnant, which was officially announced on May 16.', u"Marie Antoinette's daughter, Marie-Th\xe9r\xe8se Charlotte, Madame Royale, was born at Versailles on 19 December 1778.", u"The child's paternity was contested in the libelles.", u"In the middle of the queen's pregnancy, two events occurred which had profound impact on her later life: the return of Count Axel von Fersen to Versailles for two years, and her brother's claims on the throne of Bavaria.", u'Marie Antoinette pleaded with her husband for the French to intercede on behalf of Austria.', u"The Peace of Teschen, signed on 13 May 1779, ended the brief conflict, with the queen imposing French mediation on the demand of her mother, and Austria's gaining a territory of at least 100,000 inhabitants - a strong retreat from the early French position which was hostile towards Austria with the impression, partially justified, that the queen sided with Austria against France .", u'Meanwhile, the queen began to institute changes in the customs practiced at court.', u'Some changes were met with disapproval from the older generation, such as the abandonment of heavy make-up and the popular wide-hooped panniers.', u'The new fashion called for a more simple feminine look, typified first by the rustic robe \xe0 la polonaise and later by the gaulle, a simple muslin dress Marie Antoinette wore in a 1783 Vig\xe9e-Le Brun portrait.', u'She also began to participate in amateur plays and musicals, starting in 1780, in a theatre built for her by Mique at the Petit Trianon.', u"Repayment of the French debt remained a difficult problem, further exacerbated by Vergennes and also Marie Antoinette's prodding Louis XVI to involve France in Great Britain's war with its North American colonies: the queen played a very important role in supporting the American Revolution by securing Austrian and Russian support for France which resulted in the establishment of a neutral league that stopped Great Britain's attack, and by weighing in decisively for the nomination of Philippe Henri, marquis de S\xe9gur, as Minister of War and Charles Eug\xe8ne Gabriel de La Croix, marquis de Castries, Secretary of the Navy in 1780, who helped George Washington in defeating the British in the American Revolutionary War, which ended in 1783.", u'In 1783, the queen played a decisive role in the nomination of Charles Alexandre de Calonne, a close friend of the Polignacs, as Controller-General of Finances, and of the baron de Breteuil as the Minister for the Maison du Roi (Minister of the Royal Household), making him perhaps the strongest and most conservative minister of the reign.', u"The result of these two nominations was that Marie Antoinette's influence became paramount in government, and the new ministers rejected any major change to the structure of the old regime.", u'More than that, the decree by de S\xe9gur, the minister of war, requiring four quarterings of nobility as a condition for the appointment of officers, blocked the access of commoners to important positions in the armed forces, posing the concept of equality one of the main grievances and causes of the French Revolution.', u"Marie Antoinette's second pregnancy ended in a miscarriage early in July 1779, as confirmed by letters between the queen and her mother, although some historians believed that she may have experienced bleeding related to an irregular menstrual cycle, which she mistook for a lost pregnancy.", u'Her third pregnancy was affirmed in March 1781, and on 22 October she gave birth to Louis Joseph Xavier Fran\xe7ois, Dauphin of France.', u'Empress Maria Theresa died on 29 November 1780, in Vienna.', u'Marie Antoinette feared that the death of her mother would jeopardise the Franco-Austrian alliance (as well as, ultimately, herself), but her brother, Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, wrote to her that he had no intention of breaking the alliance.', u'A second visit from Joseph II, which had taken place in July 1781, to reaffirm the Franco-Austrian alliance and also to see his sister again, was tainted with rumours that Marie Antoinette was sending money from the French treasury to him.', u"=== Declining popularity (1782\u201385) ===\n\nDespite the general celebration over the birth of the Dauphin, Marie Antoinette's political influence, such as it was, did greatly benefit Austria.", u'During the Kettle War, in which her brother Joseph attempted to open the Scheldt River for naval passage; Marie Antoinette succeeded in obliging Vergennes to pay a huge financial compensation to Austria.', u"Finally, the queen was able to obtain her brother's support against Great Britain in the American Revolution and she neutralized French hostility to his alliance with Russia.", u'In 1782, after the governess of the Enfants de France, the princesse de Gu\xe9m\xe9n\xe9, went bankrupt and resigned, Marie Antoinette appointed her favourite, the duchesse de Polignac, to the position.', u'This decision met with disapproval from the court, as the duchess was considered to be of too modest a birth to occupy such an exalted position.', u'On the other hand, both the king and the queen trusted Mme de Polignac completely, gave her a thirteen-room apartment in Versailles and paid her well.', u"The entire Polignac family benefited greatly from the royal favour in titles and positions, but its sudden wealth and lavish lifestyle outraged most aristocratic families who resented the Polignacs' dominance at court, and also fueled the increasing popular disapprobation toward Marie Antoinette, mostly in Paris.", u'Mercy wrote to the Empress:"It is almost unexampled that in so short a time, the royal favour should have brought such overwhelming advantages to a family".', u"In June 1783, Marie Antoinette's new pregnancy was announced; however, on the night of 1\u20132 November, her 28th birthday, she suffered a miscarriage.", u"Count Axel von Fersen, after his return from America in June 1783, was accepted into the queen's private society.", u'There were and still are claims that the two were romantically involved, but since most of the correspondence between the two has been either lost or destroyed, there is no conclusive evidence of this.', u'In 1783, the queen was busy with the creation of her "hamlet", a rustic retreat built by her favoured architect, Richard Mique, according to the designs of the painter Hubert Robert.', u'Its creation, however, caused another uproar when its cost became widely known.', u'Around this time, she accumulated a library of 5000 books.', u'Those on music, often dedicated to her, were the most read, though she also liked to read history.', u'She sponsored the arts, in particular music, and also supported some scientific endeavours, encouraging and witnessing the first launch of a hot air balloon (Montgolfi\xe8re).', u"On 27 April 1784, Beaumarchais's play The Marriage of Figaro premiered in Paris.", u"After initially having been banned by the king due to its negative portrayal of the nobility, the play was finally allowed to be publicly performed because of the queen's support and its overwhelming popularity at court, where secret readings of it had been given by Marie Antoinette.", u'The play was a disaster for the image of the monarchy and aristocracy.', u"It did inspire Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro, which premiered in Vienna on 1 May 1786.", u"On 24 October 1784, putting the baron de Breteuil in charge of its acquisition, Louis XVI bought the Ch\xe2teau de Saint-Cloud from the duc d'Orl\xe9ans, in the name of his wife.", u'This was unpopular, particularly with some factions of the nobility who disliked the queen, but also with a growing percentage of the population who disapproved of a Queen of France owning her private residence independently of the king; thus, the purchase of Saint-Cloud contributed to damage the image of the queen even further in the public opinion.', u"The ch\xe2teau's expensive price, almost 6 million livres, plus the substantial extra cost of redecorating it, ensured that there was much less money going towards repaying France's substantial debt.", u'=== Prelude to the Revolution: Scandals and the failure of Reforms (1786\u201389) ===\nOn 27 March 1785, Marie Antoinette gave birth to a second son, Louis Charles, who bore the title of Duke of Normandy.', u"The fact that the birth occurred exactly nine months after Fersen's return did not escape the attention of many, leading to doubt as to the parentage of the child, and to a noticeable decline of the queen's reputation in public opinion.", u"However, the majority of Marie-Antoinette's and Louis XVII's biographers believe that the young prince was the biological son of Louis XVI, even Stefan Zweig and Antonia Fraser, who believe that Fersen and Marie Antoinette were romantically involved.", u"Courtiers at Versailles noted in their diaries that the date of the child's conception in fact corresponded perfectly with a period when the king and the queen had spent a lot of time together, but these details were ignored amid attacks on the queen's character.", u'These suspicions of illegitimacy, along with the continued publication of the libelles, and never-ending cavalcades of court intrigues, the actions of Joseph II in the Kettle War, the purchase of Saint-Cloud and the Diamond Necklace scandal combined to turn popular opinion sharply against the queen, and the image of a licentious, spendthrift, empty-headed foreign queen was quickly taking root in the French psyche.', u'A second daughter, and her last child, Marie Sophie H\xe9l\xe8ne B\xe9atrix, Madame Sophie, was born on 9 July 1786, and lived only eleven months, to 19 June 1787.', u'=== Issue ===\nMarie-Th\xe9r\xe8se-Charlotte, Madame Royale (19 December 1778 \u2013 19 October 1851)\nLouis-Joseph-Xavier-Fran\xe7ois, Dauphin (22 October 1781 \u2013 4 June 1789)\nLouis-Charles, Dauphin after the death of his elder brother, future titular king Louis XVII of France (27 March 1785 \u2013 8 June 1795)\nSophie-H\xe9l\xe8ne-B\xe9atrix, died in infancy (9 July 1786 \u2013 19 June 1787)\n\n\n==== The diamond necklace scandal ====\n\nMarie-Antoinette began to abandon her more carefree activities to become increasingly involved in politics in her role as "Queen of France".', u'By showing to the public her attention to the education and care of her children, the queen sought to improve the dissolute image she had acquired in 1785 from the "Diamond Necklace Affair", in which public opinion had falsely accused her of criminal participation in defrauding the jewelers Boehmer and Bassenge of the cost of a very expensive diamond necklace they had created originally for Madame du Barry.', u'The main actors of the scandal were the Cardinal de Rohan, prince de Rohan-Gu\xe9m\xe9n\xe9, Great Almoner of France, and Jeanne de Valois-Saint-R\xe9my, comtesse de La Motte, a descendant of an illegitimate child of Henry II of France of the House of Valois.', u'Marie Antoinette had a profound dislike for Rohan since the time he had been the French ambassador to Vienna when she was a child.', u'Despite his high clerical position at the Court, she never addressed a word to him.', u"Others involved were Nicole Legay, alias baronne d'Oliva, a prostitute who happened to be a lookalike of Marie Antoinette, R\xe9taux de Villette, a forger, Alessandro Cagliostro, an Italian adventurer, and the comte de La Motte, Jeanne de Valois' husband.", u'Mme de La Motte tricked Rohan into buying the necklace as a gift to Marie-Antoinette, in order for him to get into the favors of the queen.', u'When the affair was discovered, those involved (except de La Motte and R\xe9aux de Villette who managed to flee) were arrested, tried, convicted and either imprisoned or exiled.', u'The only one imprisoned was Mme de La Motte, who was given a life sentence to Piti\xe9-Salp\xeatri\xe8re Hospital, which also served as a prison for women.', u'Judged by the Parlement, Rohan was found innocent of any wrongdoing (which he was), and allowed to leave the Bastille.', u'Marie Antoinette, who had insisted on the arrest of the Cardinal was dealt a heavy personal blow, as was the monarchy, and despite the fact that the guilty parties were tried and convicted, the affair proved to be extremely damaging to her reputation, which never recovered from it.', u'==== Failure of political and financial reforms ====\nSuffering from an acute case of depression, the king began to seek the advice of his wife.', u'In her new role and with increasing degree of power as a politically viable entity, the queen tried to help the situation brewing between the assembly and the king.', u"This change of the queen's political position signalled the end of the Polignacs' influence and their impact on the finances of the Crown.", u'Continuing deterioration of the financial situation, despite cutbacks to the royal retinue and court expenses, ultimately forced the king, the queen and the Minister of Finance, Calonne, at the urging of Vergennes, to call the Assembly of Notables, after a hiatus of 160 years.', u'The assembly was held to attempt passing necessary financial reforms, but the Parlements refused to cooperate.', u'The first meeting took place on 22 February 1787, (nine days after the death of Vergennes on 13 February).', u'Marie Antoinette did not attend the meeting and her absence resulted in accusations that the queen was trying to undermine its purpose.', u'The Assembly was a failure: it did not pass any reforms and, instead, fell into the pattern of defying the king.', u'On the urging of the queen, Louis XVI dismissed Calonne on 8 April 1787.', u"On 1 May 1787, \xc9tienne Charles de Lom\xe9nie de Brienne, the archbishop of Toulouse and one of the queen's political allies, was appointed by the king, on Marie Antoinette's urging, to replace Calonne, first as the Controller-General of Finances and then as Prime Minister.", u'He began to institute more cutbacks at court, while trying to restore the royal absolute power weakened by parliaments.', u"Brienne, though, was not able to improve the financial situation, and since he was the queen's ally, this failure adversely affected her political position.", u'The continued poor financial climate of the country resulted in the 25 May dissolution of the Assembly of Notables because of its inability to get things done, and the lack of solutions was blamed on the queen.', u"France's financial problems were the result of a combination of factors: several expensive wars; a large royal family whose expenditures were paid for by the state; and an unwillingness on the part of most members of the privileged classes, aristocracy and clergy, to help defray the costs of the government out of their own pockets by relinquishing some of their financial privileges.", u'As a result of the public perception that she had single-handedly ruined the national finances, Marie Antoinette was given the nickname of "Madame D\xe9ficit" in the summer of 1787.', u'While sole fault for the financial crisis did not lie with her, Marie Antoinette was the biggest obstacle to any major reform effort.', u'She had played a decisive role in the disgrace of the reformer Ministers of Finance, Turgot (in 1776), and Jacques Necker (first dismissal in 1781).', u'If the secret expenses of the queen were taken into account, the expense of the court was much higher than the official estimate of 7% of the state budget.', u'The queen attempted to fight back with propaganda portraying her as a caring mother, most notably in the painting by \xc9lisabeth Vig\xe9e Le Brun exhibited at the Royal Acad\xe9mie Salon de Paris in August 1787, showing her with her children.', u'Around the same time, Jeanne de Valois-Saint-R\xe9my escaped from prison and fled to London, where she published damaging slander concerning her supposed amorous affair with the queen.', u"The political situation in 1787 worsened when, on Marie Antoinette's urging, on 15 August the Parlement was exiled in Troyes.", u'It further deteriorated when Louis XVI tried to use a lit de justice on 11 November to impose legislation.', u"The new duc d'Orl\xe9ans publicly protested the king's actions, and was subsequently exiled to his estate at Villers-Cotter\xeats.", u'The May Edicts issued on 8 May 1788 were also opposed by the public and parliaments.', u'Finally, on 8 August, Louis XVI announced his intention to bring back the Estates General, the traditional elected legislature of the country, which had not been convened since 1614.', u"While from late 1787 up to his death in June 1789, Marie-Antoinette's primary concern was the continued deterioration of the health of the Dauphin, who suffered from tuberculosis, she was directly involved with the exile of the Parlement, the May Edicts and the announcement regarding the Estates General; she did participate in the King Council, the first queen to do this in over 175 years (since Marie de' Medici had been named Chef du Conseil du Roi, between 1614 and 1617), and she was making the major decisions behind the scene and in the King Council.", u"Marie Antoinette was instrumental in the recall of Jacques Necker as Finance Minister on 26 August, a popular move, even though she herself was worried that the recall would again go against her if Necker proved unsuccessful in reforming the country's finances, and she accepted Necker's proposition to double the representation of the Tiers \xc9tat in an attempt to check the power of the aristocracy\nOn the eve of the opening of the Estates General, the queen attended the mass celebrating its return.", u"From time of its very opening on 5 May 1789, the fracture between the democratic Third Estate (consisting of bourgeois and radical aristocrats), and the conservative nobility of the Second Estate widened, and Marie Antoinette knew that her rival, the duc d'Orl\xe9ans, who had given money and bread to the people during the winter, would be acclaimed by the crowd, much to her detriment.", u'The death of the Dauphin on 4 June, which deeply affected his parents, was virtually ignored by the French people, who were instead preparing for the next meeting of the Estates General and hoping for a resolution to the bread crisis.', u'As the Third Estate declared itself a National Assembly and took the Tennis Court Oath, and as people either spread or believed rumors that the queen wished to bathe in their blood, Marie Antoinette went into mourning for her eldest son.', u'Her role was decisive in urging the king to remain firm and to not concede to popular demands for reforms.', u'In addition, she was showing her determination to use force to crush the forthcoming revolution.', u'== The French Revolution before Varennes (1789\u201391) ==\n\nThe situation escalated on 20 June as the Third Estate, which had been joined by several members of the clergy and radical nobility, found the door to its appointed meeting place closed by order of the king.', u'It thus met at the tennis court in Versailles and took the Tennis Court Oath not to separate before it had given a constitution to the nation.', u"On 11 July, on Marie Antoinette's urging, Necker was dismissed to be replaced by Breteuil, the queen's choice to crush the Revolution with mercenary Swiss troops under the command of one of her favorites, Pierre Victor, baron de Besenval de Br\xfcnstatt.", u'At the news, Paris was besieged by riots which culminated in the storming of the Bastille on 14 July, and on 15 July Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette was named commander-in-chief of the newly formed Garde nationale.', u"In the days following the storming of the Bastille, for fear of assassination, and ordered by the king, the emigration of members of the high aristocracy began, with the departure of the comte d'Artois, the Cond\xe9s, cousins of the king, and the unpopular Polignacs on 17 July.", u'Marie Antoinette, whose life was as much in danger, remained by the king whose power was gradually being taken away by the National Constituent Assembly.', u"The abolition of feudal privileges by the National Constituent Assembly on 4 August 1789, and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (La D\xe9claration des Droits de l'Homme et du Citoyen), drafted by La Fayette with the help of Thomas Jefferson, and adopted on 26 August, led the way to the Constitutional Monarchy (4 September 1791 \u2013 21 September 1792).", u'Despite these dramatic changes, life at court continued, while the situation in Paris was becoming critical because of bread shortages in September.', u"On 5 October, a crowd from Paris descended upon Versailles and forced the royal family to move to the Tuileries Palace in Paris, where they lived under a form of house arrest under the watch of La Fayette's Garde nationale, while the comte de Provence and his wife were allowed to reside in the Petit Luxembourg, where they remained until going into exile on 20 June 1791.", u'Marie Antoinette continued performing charitable functions, attending religious ceremonies, but mostly dedicated her time to her children.', u'She also played an important political, albeit not public, role between 1789 and 1791, in which time she had a complex set of relationships with several key actors of the early period of the French Revolution.', u'One of the most important was Necker, the "Prime Minister of Finances" (Premier ministre des finances).', u'Despite her dislike of him, she played a decisive role in his return to office; however, she blamed him for his supporting the Revolution, and did not regret his resignation in 1790.', u'La Fayette, one of the former military leaders in the American War of Independence (1775\u201383), served as the warden of the royal family in his position as commander-in-chief of the Garde nationale.', u'Despite his dislike of the queen - he detested her as much as she detested him and, at one time, had even threatened sending her to a convent - he was persuaded by the mayor of Paris, Jean Sylvain Bailly, to work in collaboration with her, and even allowed her to see Fersen a number of times.', u'He even went as far as exiling the Duke of Orl\xe9ans, who was accused by the queen of fomenting trouble.', u'His relation with the king was more cordial: being a liberal aristocrat, he did not want the fall of the monarchy but the establishment of a liberal one, similar to that of the United Kingdom, based on collaboration between the king and the people, as was to be defined in the Constitution of 1791.', u'Despite her attempts to remain out of the public eye, Marie Antoinette was falsely accused in the libelles of conducting an affair with La Fayette, whom she loathed, and, as was published in "Le Godmich\xe9 Royal" (translated, "The Royal Dildo"), on having a sexual relationship with the English Baroness \'Lady Sophie Farrell\' of Bournemouth, a well-known lesbian of the time.', u'Publication of such calumnies continued to the end, climaxing at her trial with that of incest with her son.', u'There is no evidence to support the accusations.', u'=== Mirabeau ===\nA significant achievement for Marie Antoinette in that period was the establishment of an alliance with Honor\xe9 Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau, the most important lawmaker in the assembly.', u'Like La Fayette, Mirabeau was a liberal aristocrat.', u'He had joined the tiers \xe9tat, and was not against the monarchy, but wanted to reconcile the monarchy with the Revolution.', u'He also wanted to be a minister and was not immune to corruption.', u'On the advice of Mercy, Marie Antoinette opened secret negotiations with him and both agreed to meet in secret at the ch\xe2teau of Saint-Cloud on 3 July 1790, where the royal family was allowed to spend the summer, free of the radical elements who watched their every move in Paris.', u'At the meeting, Mirabeau was much impressed by the queen, and remarked in a letter to the comte de La Marck that she was the only man the king had by him: La reine est le seul homme que le roi ait aupr\xe8s de lui.', u"A deal was reached turning Mirabeau into one of her political allies: Marie Antoinette promised to pay him 6000 livres per month and one million if he succeeded in his mission to restore the king's authority.", u'The only time the royal couple returned to Paris in that period was on 14 July, to attend the F\xeate de la F\xe9d\xe9ration, the official ceremony held at the Champ de Mars in commemoration of the fall of the Bastille one year earlier.', u'At least 300,000 persons participated from all over France including 18,000 national guards, with Talleyrand, bishop of Autun, celebrating a mass at the autel de la patrie ("altar of the fatherland").', u'At the event, the king was greeted with loud cheers of "Long Live The King ", especially when he took the oath to protect the Nation and to enforce the laws voted by the Constitutional Assembly.', u'There were even cheers to the queen, particularly when she presented the Dauphin to the public.', u"Mirabeau sincerely wanted to reconcile the queen with the people, and she was happy to see him restoring much of the king's powers, such as his authority over foreign policy, and the right to declare war.", u'Over the objections of La Fayette and his allies, the king was given a suspensive veto allowing him to veto any laws for a period of four years.', u'With time, Mirabeau would support the queen even more, going as far as to suggest Louis XVI "adjourn" to Rouen or Compi\xe8gne.', u'However, this leverage with the Assembly ended with the death of Mirabeau in April 1791, despite the attempt of several moderate leaders of the Revolution to contact the queen to establish some kind of cooperation with her.', u"=== Civil Constitution of the Clergy ===\nIn March 1791, Pope Pius VI had condemned the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, reluctantly signed by Louis XVI, which reduced the number of bishops from 132 to 93, imposed the election of bishops and all members of the clergy by departmental or district assemblies of electors, and finally reduced the Pope's authority over the Church.", u'Religion played an important role in the life of Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI, both raised in the Roman Catholic faith.', u"The queen's political ideas and her belief in the absolute power of monarchs were based on France's monarchy long established on the divine right of kings.", u"On 18 April, as the royal family was ready to leave for Saint-Cloud to attend Easter mass celebrated by a refractory priest, a crowd, soon joined by the Garde nationale (disobeying La Fayette's orders), kept it from leaving Paris, and prompting Marie Antoinette to declare to La Fayette that she and her family were no longer free.", u"This incident fortified her in her determination to leave Paris; however, both for affective and political reasons, not alone, but with her family, and even the king, who had been hesitant, accepted his wife's decision to flee with the help of foreign powers and counter revolutionary forces.", u'Fersen and Breteuil (who represented her in the courts of Europe) were put in charge of the escape plan, while Marie Antoinette continued her negotiations with some moderate leaders of the French Revolution.', u"== Flight, arrest at Varennes and return to Paris (21\u201325 June 1791) ==\n\nThere had been several plots designed to help the royal family escape, which the queen had rejected because she would not leave without the king, or which had ceased to be viable because of the king's indecision.", u'Once Louis XVI finally did commit to a plan, its poor execution was the cause of its failure.', u'In an elaborate attempt, known as the Flight to Varennes, to reach the royalist stronghold of Montm\xe9dy, some members of the royal family were to pose as the servants of (the imaginary) Mme de Korff, a wealthy Russian baroness, in the role held by Louise-\xc9lisabeth de Cro\xff de Tourzel, governess of the royal children.', u'After many delays, the escape ultimately occurred on 21 June 1791, but the entire family was arrested twenty-four hours later at Varennes and taken back to Paris within a week.', u'The escape attempt destroyed much of the remaining support of the population for the king\nUpon learning of the capture of the royal family, the National Constituent Assembly sent three representatives, Antoine Barnave, J\xe9r\xf4me P\xe9tion de Villeneuve and Charles C\xe9sar de Fay de La Tour-Maubourg to Varennes to escort Marie Antoinette and her family back to Paris, where they were jeered and insulted by the people as never before.', u'The prestige of the French monarchy had never been at such a low level.', u'During the trip, Barnave, the representative of the moderate party in the Assembly, protected Marie Antoinette from the crowds, and even P\xe9tion took pity on the royal family.', u'Brought safely back to Paris, they were met with total silence from the crowd.', u'Thanks to Barnave, the royal couple was not brought to trial and was publicly exonerated of any crime in relation with the attempted escape.', u'During the night of 21\u201322 June, the queen\'s hair had, according to Mme Campan, Marie Antoinette\'s first lady-of-the-bedchamber, "in one night it turned white as those of a seventy-year old woman."', u"(En une seule nuit ils \xe9taient devenus blancs comme ceux d'une femme de soixante-dix ans.)", u'== Radicalization of the Revolution after Varennes (1791\u201392) ==\n\nAfter their return from Varennes, and until the storming of the Tuileries on 10 August 1792, the queen, her family and entourage were held by the Garde nationale under tight surveillance within the Tuileries, where the royal couple was guarded night and day.', u'Four guards accompanied her wherever she went, and her bedroom door had to be left open at night.', u'Her health also began to deteriorate, thus further reducing her physical activities.', u"On 17 July 1791, with the support of Barnave and his friends, La Fayette's Garde nationale opened fire on the crowd who had assembled on the Champ de Mars to sign a petition demanding the deposition of the king.", u'The estimated number of those killed varies between 12 and 50.', u"La Fayette's reputation never recovered from the event and, on 8 October, he resigned as commander of the Garde nationale.", u'Always refusing his help, Marie Antoinette played a decisive role in defeating him in his aims to become the mayor of Paris in November 1791.', u'As her correspondence shows, while Barnave was taking great political risks with the belief the queen was his political ally, and had managed, despite her unpopularity, to secure a moderate majority ready to work with her, Marie Antoinette was not sincere in her cooperation with the moderate leaders of the French Revolution, which ultimately ended any chance to establish a moderate government.', u"Moreover, the view that the unpopular queen was controlling the king further degraded the royal couple's standing with the people, which the Jacobins successfully exploited after their return from Varennes to advance their radical agenda to abolish the monarchy.", u'This situation lasted until the spring of 1792.', u'Marie Antoinette kept hoping that the military coalition of the European kingdoms would succeed in crushing the Revolution.', u'She counted mostly on the support of her Austrian family.', u'After the death of her brother Joseph in 1790, his successor, Leopold was willing to support her, but only to a limited degree.', u"However, upon Leopold's death in 1792, his son, Francis, a conservative ruler, was ready to support the cause of the French royal couple because he feared the consequences of the French Revolution and its ideas on the monarchies of Europe and, more particularly, on Austria's influence in the continent.", u'Barnave had advised the queen to call back Mercy, who had played such an important role in her life before the Revolution, but Mercy had been appointed to another foreign diplomatic position and could not return to France.', u'At the end of 1791, ignoring the danger she faced, the princesse de Lamballe, who was in London, returned to the Tuileries.', u'As for Fersen, in February 1792, despite the strong restriction imposed on her, he was able to see the queen a final time.', u"== Events leading to the abolition of the monarchy on 10 August 1792 - Temple ==\n\nLeopold's and Francis II's aggressive actions on Marie Antoinette's behalf led to France's declaration of war on Austria on 20 April 1792.", u'This resulted in the queen being viewed as an enemy, even though she was against Austrian claims to French territories on European soil.', u'That summer, the situation was compounded by multiple defeats of the French armies by the Austrians, in part because of Marie Antoinette passed military secrets to Austria.', u'In addition, at the insistence of his wife, Louis XVI vetoed several measures that would have further restricted his power, earning the royal couple the nicknames "Monsieur Veto" and "Madame Veto".', u'nicknames then prominently featured in different contexts, including La Carmagnole.', u'Barnave remained the most important advisor and supporter of the queen, who was willing to work with him as long as he followed her demands, which he did to a large extent.', u'Barnave and the moderates made up about 260 lawmakers in the new Legislative Assembly; the radicals numbered around 136, and the rest around 350.', u"Initially, the majority was with Barnave, but the queen's policy led to the radicalization of the Assembly and the moderates lost control of the legislative process.", u'The moderate government collapsed in April 1792 and was replaced by a radical majority headed by the Girondins.', u'The Assembly then passed a series of laws concerning the Church, the aristocracy and the formation of new national guard units: all were vetoed by Louis XVI.', u"While Barnave's section had fallen to 120 members, the new Girondin majority controlled the legislative assembly with 330 members.", u'The two strongest members of that government were Jean Marie Roland, who was minister of interior, and General Dumouriez, the minister of foreign affairs.', u'Dumouriez sympathised with the royal couple and wanted to save them; however, he was rebuffed by the queen.', u"Marie Antoinette's actions in refusing to collaborate with the Girondins, in power between April and June 1792, led them to denounce the treason of the Austrian comity, a direct allusion to the queen.", u"After Madame Roland sent a letter to the king denouncing the queen's role in these matters, pushed by the queen, Louis XVI sacked the government, thus losing his majority in the Assembly.", u'Dumouriez resigned and refused a post in any new government.', u'At this point, the tide within the population and political parties against the royal authority intensified, while Marie Antoinette encouraged the king to veto the new laws voted by the Legislative Assembly in 1792.', u'In August 1791, the Declaration of Pillnitz threatened to invade France.', u'This led in turn to the French declaration of war in April 1792, which led to the French Revolutionary Wars and to the events of August 1792, which ended the monarchy.', u'On 20 June 1792, "a mob of terrifying aspect" broke into the Tuileries, made the king wear the bonnet rouge (red Phrygian cap) to show his loyalty to the Republic, insulted Marie Antoinette, accusing her of betraying France, and threatened her life.', u'In consequence, the queen asked Fersen to push the foreign powers to activate their invasion of France, and to issue a manifesto in which the foreign powers threatened to destroy Paris if anything happened to the royal family.', u'The Brunswick Manifesto, issued on 25 July 1792, triggered the events of 10 August when the approach of an armed mob on its way to the Tuileries Palace forced the royal family to seek refuge at the Legislative Assembly.', u'Ninety minutes later, the palace was invaded by the mob who massacred the Swiss Guards.', u'On 13 August, the royal family was imprisoned in the tower of the Temple in the Marais under conditions considerably harsher than those of their previous confinement in the Tuileries.', u"A week later, several of the royal family's attendants, among them the princesse de Lamballe, were taken in for interrogation by the Paris Commune.", u'Transferred to the La Force prison, after a rapid judgment, Marie Louise de Lamballe was savagely killed on 3 September.', u'Her head was affixed on a pike and marched through the city to the Temple for the queen to see.', u'Marie Antoinette was kept from seeing it, but fainted upon learning of it.', u'On 21 September 1792, the fall of the monarchy was officially declared, and the National Convention became the governing body of the French Republic.', u'The royal family was re-styled as the non-royal "Capets".', u'Preparations began for the trial of the king in a court of law.', u"=== Louis XVI's trial and execution ===\n\nCharged with undermining the First French Republic, Louis XVI was separated from his family and tried in December.", u'He was found guilty by the Convention led by the Jacobins who rejected the idea of keeping him as a hostage.', u'On 15 January 1793, by vote with a majority of one voice, that of Philippe \xc9galit\xe9, he was condemned to death by guillotine and was executed on 21 January 1793.', u'== Marie Antoinette in the Temple ==\nThe queen, now called "Widow Capet", plunged into deep mourning.', u"She still hoped her son, Louis XVII, whom the comte de Provence had, from exile, recognised as Louis XVI's successor, would one day rule France.", u'The royalists and the refractory clergy, including those preparing the insurrection in Vend\xe9e, supported Marie Antoinette and the return to the monarchy.', u'Throughout her imprisonment and up to her execution, Marie-Antoinette could count on the sympathy of conservative factions and social-religious groups which had turned against the Revolution, and also on wealthy individuals ready to corrupt republican officials in order to facilitate her escape; however, all plots failed.', u"Prisoners in the tower of the Temple, Marie Antoinette, her children and \xc9lisabeth were insulted, some of the guards going as far as smoking in the ex-queen's face.", u'Strict security measures were taken to assure that Marie Antoinette was not able to communicate with the outside world; but, despite these measures, several of the guardians were open to corruption, and a line of communication was kept with the outer world.', u"After Louis' execution, Marie Antoinette's fate became a central question of the National Convention.", u'While some advocated for her death, others proposed exchanging her for French prisoners of war or for a ransom from the Holy Roman Emperor.', u'Thomas Paine advocated exile to America.', u"In April 1793, during the Reign of Terror, a Committee of Public Safety dominated by Robespierre was formed, and men such as Jacques H\xe9bert began to call for Antoinette's trial.", u'By the end of May, the Girondins had been chased from power.', u'Calls were also made to "retrain" the eight-year old Louis XVII, to make him pliant to revolutionary ideas.', u'To carry this out, Louis Charles was separated from his mother on 3 July after a heartwrenching struggle during which his mother fought in vain to retain her son, who was handed to Antoine Simon, a cobbler, and representative of the Paris Commune.', u'Until her removal from the Temple, Marie Antoinette spent hours trying to catch a glimpse of her son, who, within weeks, had been made to turn against her, accusing his mother of wrongdoings.', u"=== Conciergerie ===\nOn the night of 1 August, at 1:00 in the morning, Marie Antoinette was transferred from the Temple to an isolated cell in the Conciergerie as 'Prisoner n\xb0 280'.", u'Leaving the tower without bending, she banged her head against the lintel of the door, which prompted one of her guards to ask her if she was hurt, to which she answered: "No!', u'Nothing now can hurt me."', u'This was the most difficult period of her captivity.', u'She was under constant surveillance, with no privacy.', u'The "Carnation Plot" (Le complot de l\'\u0153illet), an attempt to help her escape at the end of August, was foiled due to the inability to corrupt all the guards.', u'She was attended by Rosalie Lamorli\xe8re, who cared for her as much as and as well as she could.', u'At least once, she received the visit of a Catholic priest.', u'== Trial and execution (14\u201316 October 1793) ==\n\nMarie Antoinette was tried by the Revolutionary Tribunal on 14 October 1793.', u'Some historians believe the outcome of the trial had been decided in advance by the Committee of Public Safety around the time the Carnation Plot was uncovered.', u'She and her lawyers were given less than one day to prepare her defense.', u'Among the accusations, many previously published in the libelles, were: orchestrating orgies in Versailles, sending millions of livres of treasury money to Austria, planning the massacre of the "gardes fran\xe7aises" (National Guards) in 1792, declaring her son to be the new king of France, and\u2014by her son Louis Charles himself (pushed by radical elements who controlled him)\u2014of incest.', u'This last accusation drew an emotional response from Marie Antoinette, who refused to respond to this charge and, instead, called on all mothers present in the room: their reaction brought her comfort since these women were not sympathetic to her.', u'Early on 16 October, Marie Antoinette was declared guilty of the three main charges against her: depletion of the national treasury, conspiracy against the internal and external security of the State, intelligence with the enemy, this one alone being enough to condemn her to death.', u'At worst, she and her lawyers had expected life imprisonment.', u'In the hours left to her, she composed a letter to her sister-in-law, Madame \xc9lisabeth, affirming her clear conscience, her Catholic faith, and her love and concern for her children.', u'The letter did not reach \xc9lisabeth.', u'Preparing for her execution, she had to change clothes in front of her guards.', u'She put on a plain white dress, white being the color worn by widowed queens of France.', u'Her hair was shorn, her hands bound painfully behind her back and she was leashed with a rope.', u'Unlike her husband, who had been taken to his execution in a carriage (carrosse), she had to sit in an open cart (charrette) for the hour it took from the Conciergerie via the rue Saint-Honor\xe9 thoroughfare to reach the guillotine erected in Place de la R\xe9volution, (present-day Place de la Concorde).', u'She maintained her composure, despite the insults of the jeering crowd.', u'For her final confession, a constitutional priest was assigned to her.', u'He sat by her in the cart, and she ignored him all the way to the scaffold.', u'Marie Antoinette was guillotined at 12:15 p.m. on 16 October 1793.', u'Her last words were "Pardon me, sir, I meant not to do it", to Henri Sanson the executioner, whose foot she had accidentally stepped on after climbing to the scaffold.', u"Her body was thrown into an unmarked grave in the Madeleine cemetery located close by, rue d'Anjou.", u'Because of saturation, the cemetery was closed the following year, on 25 March 1794.', u"Both Marie Antoinette's and Louis XVI's bodies were exhumed on 18 January 1815, during the Bourbon Restoration, when the comte de Provence had ascended the newly reestablished throne as Louis XVIII, King of France and of Navarre.", u'Christian burial of the royal remains took place three days later, on 21 January, in the necropolis of French kings at the Basilica of St Denis.', u'== Legacy ==\nLong after her death, Marie Antoinette remains a major historical figure linked with conservatism, the Catholic Church, wealth, and fashion.', u'She has been the subject of a quantity of books, films and other forms of media.', u'Politically engaged authors have deemed her the quintessential representative of class conflict, western aristocracy and absolutism.', u'Some of her contemporaries, such as Jefferson, attributed to her the start of the French Revolution.', u'For others, Marie Antoinette was a victim of her family ambition and the general situation in France.', u'However, even her critics have recognized her qualities as a mother and her courage in dying.', u'== In popular culture ==\n\nThe phrase "Let them eat cake" is often attributed to Marie Antoinette, but there is no evidence she ever uttered it, and it is now generally regarded as a "journalistic clich\xe9".', u'This phrase originally appeared in Book VI of the first part (finished in 1767, published in 1782) of Jean-Jacques Rousseau\'s putative autobiographical work, Les Confessions: "Enfin je me rappelai le pis-aller d\'une grande princesse \xe0 qui l\'on disait que les paysans n\'avaient pas de pain, et qui r\xe9pondit: Qu\'ils mangent de la brioche" ("Finally I recalled the stopgap solution of a great princess who was told that the peasants had no bread, and who responded: \'Let them eat brioche\'").', u'Apart from the fact that Rousseau ascribes these words to an unknown princess, vaguely referred to as a "great princess", the purported writing date precedes Marie Antoinette\'s arrival in France.', u'Some think that he invented it altogether.', u'In the United States, expressions of gratitude to France for its help in the American Revolution included the naming of the city of Marietta, Ohio, founded in 1788.', u'The Ohio Company of Associates chose the name Marietta after an affectionate nickname for Marie Antoinette.', u'It can be also seen how her life has made for the production of many movies, from regal French movies to popular American movies, casting famous actors and actresses, one movie being "Marie Antoinette"\n\n\n== Ancestry ==\n\n\n== Issue ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nFrench Revolution\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n===

it is in fact one of the lower courts in such a process.', u'=== Hong Kong ===\nIn Hong Kong, the Supreme Court of Hong Kong (now known as the High Court of Hong Kong) was the final court of appeal during its colonial times which ended with transfer of sovereignty in 1997.', u'The final adjudication power, as in any other British Colonies, rested with the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (JCPC) in London, United Kingdom.', u'Now the power of final adjudication is vested in the Court of Final Appeal created in 1997.', u'Under the Basic Law, its constitution, the territory remains a common law jurisdiction.', u'Consequently, judges from other common law jurisdictions (including England and Wales) can be recruited and continue to serve in the judiciary according to Article 92 of the Basic Law.', u"On the other hand, the power of interpretation of the Basic Law itself is vested in the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) in Beijing (without retroactive effect), and the courts are authorised to interpret the Basic Law when trying cases, in accordance with Article 158 of the Basic Law.", u'This arrangement became controversial in light of the right of abode issue in 1999, raising concerns for judicial independence.', u'=== India ===\n\nIn India, the Supreme Court of India was created on January 28, 1950 after adoption of the Constitution.', u'Article 141 of the Constitution of India states that the law declared by Supreme Court is to be binding on all Courts within the territory of India.', u'It is the highest court in India and has ultimate judicial authority to interpret the Constitution and decide questions of national law (including local bylaws).', u'The Supreme Court is also vested with the power of judicial review to ensure the application of the rule of law.', u'Note that within the constitutional framework of India, Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) has a special status vis-a-vis the other states of India.', u'Article 370 of the Constitution of India carves out certain exceptions for J&K.', u'However, the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order 1954 makes Article 141 applicable to the state of J&K and hence law declared by the Supreme Court of India is equally applicable to all courts of J&K including the High Court.', u'=== Ireland ===\nThe Supreme Court is the highest court in the Republic of Ireland.', u'It has authority to interpret the constitution, and strike down laws and activities of the state that it finds to be unconstitutional.', u'It is also the highest authority in the interpretation of the law.', u'Constitutionally it must have authority to interpret the constitution but its further appellate jurisdiction from lower courts is defined by law.', u'The Irish Supreme Court consists of its presiding member, the Chief Justice, and seven other judges.', u'Judges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the President in accordance with the binding advice of the Government.', u'The Supreme Court sits in the Four Courts in Dublin.', u"=== Israel ===\nIsrael's Supreme Court is at the head of the court system in the State of Israel.", u'It is the highest judicial instance.', u'The Supreme Court sits in Jerusalem.', u'The area of its jurisdiction is the entire State.', u'A ruling of the Supreme Court is binding upon every court, other than the Supreme Court itself.', u'The Israeli supreme court is both an appellate court and the high court of justice.', u'As an appellate court, the Supreme Court considers cases on appeal (both criminal and civil) on judgments and other decisions of the District Courts.', u'It also considers appeals on judicial and quasi-judicial decisions of various kinds, such as matters relating to the legality of Knesset elections and disciplinary rulings of the Bar Association.', u'As the High Court of Justice (Hebrew: Beit Mishpat Gavoha Le\'Zedek \u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05de\u05e9\u05e4\u05d8 \u05d2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d4 \u05dc\u05e6\u05d3\u05e7; also known by its initials as Bagatz \u05d1\u05d2"\u05e5), the Supreme Court rules as a court of first instance, primarily in matters regarding the legality of decisions of State authorities: Government decisions, those of local authorities and other bodies and persons performing public functions under the law, and direct challenges to the constitutionality of laws enacted by the Knesset.', u'The court has broad discretionary authority to rule on matters in which it considers it necessary to grant relief in the interests of justice, and which are not within the jurisdiction of another court or tribunal.', u'The High Court of Justice grants relief through orders such as injunction, mandamus and Habeas Corpus, as well as through declaratory judgments.', u'The Supreme Court can also sit at a further hearing on its own judgment.', u'In a matter on which the Supreme Court has ruled -

Madison (1803).', u'There are currently nine seats on the US Supreme Court.', u"Each U.S. state has a state supreme court, which is the highest authority interpreting that state's law and administering that state's judiciary.", u'Two states, Oklahoma and Texas, each have two separate highest courts that respectively specialize in criminal cases and civil cases.', u'Although Delaware has a specialized court, the Court of Chancery, to hear cases in equity, it is not a supreme court because the Delaware Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over it.', u'The titles of state supreme court vary, which can cause confusion between jurisdictions because one state may use a name for its highest court that another uses for a lower court.', u'In New York, Maryland, and the District of Columbia the highest court is called the Court of Appeals, a name used by many states for their intermediate appellate courts.', u'Further, trial courts of general jurisdiction in New York are called the Supreme Court, and the intermediate appellate court is called the Supreme Court, Appellate Division.', u'In West Virginia, the highest court of the state is the Supreme Court of Appeals.', u'In Maine and Massachusetts the highest court is styled the "Supreme Judicial Court"; the last is the oldest appellate court of continuous operation in the Western Hemisphere.', u'== Civil law jurisdictions ==\nThe Roman law and the Corpus Juris Civilis are generally held to be the historical model for civil law.', u'From the late 18th century onwards, civil law jurisdictions began to codify their laws, most of all in civil codes.', u'=== Austria ===\nIn Austria, the Austrian Constitution of 1920 (based on a draft by Hans Kelsen) introduced judicial review of legislative acts for their constitutionality.', u'This function is performed by the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof), which is also charged with the review of administrative acts on whether they violate constitutionally guaranteed rights.', u'Other than that, administrative acts are reviewed by the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof).', u'The Supreme Court (Oberste Gerichtshof (OGH)), stands at the top of Austria\'s system of "ordinary courts" (ordentliche Gerichte) as the final instance in issues of private law and criminal law.', u'=== Brazil ===\nIn Brazil, the Supreme Federal Tribunal (Supremo Tribunal Federal) is the highest court.', u'It is both the constitutional court and the court of last resort in Brazilian law.', u'It only reviews cases that may be unconstitutional or final habeas corpus pleads for criminal cases.', u'It also judges, in original jurisdiction, cases involving members of congress, senators, ministers of state, members of the high courts and the President and Vice-President of the Republic.', u'The Superior Court of Justice (Tribunal Superior de Justi\xe7a) reviews State and Federal Circuit courts decisions for civil law and criminal law cases, when dealing with federal law or conflicting rulings.', u'The Superior Labour Tribunal (Tribunal Superior do Trabalho) reviews cases involving labour law.', u'The Superior Electoral Tribunal (Tribunal Superior Eleitoral) is the court of last resort of electoral law, and also oversees general elections.', u'The Superior Military Tribunal (Tribunal Superior Militar) is the highest court in matters of federal military law.', u'=== Croatia ===\nIn Croatia, the supreme jurisdiction is given to the Supreme Court, which secures a uniform application of laws.', u'The Constitutional Court exists to verify constitutionality of laws and regulations, as well as decide on individual complaints on decisions on governmental bodies.', u'It also decides on jurisdictional disputes between the legislative, executive and judicial branches.', u'=== Denmark ===\nIn Denmark, all ordinary courts have original jurisdiction to hear all types of cases, including cases of a constitutional or administrative nature.', u'As a result, there exists no special constitutional court, and therefore final jurisdiction is vested with the Danish Supreme Court (H\xf8jesteret) which was established 14 February 1661 by king Frederik III.', u"=== France ===\nIn France, supreme appellate jurisdiction is divided among three judicial bodies:\nfor judicial cases, i.e., civil or criminal matters: Court of Cassation (Cour de cassation)\nfor administrative cases: Council of State (Conseil d'\xc9tat)\nconstitutional challenges of statutory laws: Constitutional Council (Conseil constitutionnel)\nWhen there is jurisdictional dispute between judicial and administrative courts: the Court of Arbitration (Tribunal des conflits), which is empanelled half from the Court of Cassation and half from the Council of State and presided over by the Minister of Justice, is called together to settle the dispute or hand down a final decision.", u'The High Court (Haute Cour) exists only to impeach the President of the French Republic in case of "breach of his duties patently incompatible with his continuing in office".', u'Since a constitutional amendment of 2007, the French Constitution states that the High Court is composed of all members of both Houses of Parliament.', u'As of 2012, it has never been convened.', u'=== Germany ===\nIn Germany, there is no de jure single supreme court.', u'Instead, cases are handled by numerous federal courts, depending on their nature.', u'Final interpretation of and amendments to the German Constitution, the Grundgesetz, is the task of the Bundesverfassungsgericht (Federal Constitutional Court), which is the de facto highest German court, as it can declare both federal and state legislation ineffective, and has the power to overrule decisions of all other federal courts, despite not being a regular court of appeals on itself in the German court system.', u'It is also the only court possessing the power and authority to outlaw political parties, if it is deemed that these parties have repeatedly violated articles of the Constitution.', u'When it comes to civil and criminal cases, the Bundesgerichtshof is at the top of the hierarchy of courts.', u'The other branches of the German judicial system each have their own appellate systems, each topped by a high court; these are the Bundessozialgericht for matters of social security, the Bundesarbeitsgericht for employment and labour, the Bundesfinanzhof for taxation and financial issues, and the Bundesverwaltungsgericht for administrative law.', u"The so-called Gemeinsamer Senat der Obersten Gerichtsh\xf6fe (Joint Senate of the Supreme Courts) is not a supreme court in itself, but an ad-hoc body that is convened in only when one supreme court intends to diverge from another supreme court's legal opinion or when a certain case exceeds the authority of one court.", u'As the courts have well-defined areas of responsibility, situations like these are rather rare and so, the Joint Senate gathers very infrequently, and only to consider matters which are mostly definitory.', u'=== The Netherlands ===\nIn the Netherlands, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands is the highest.', u'Its decisions, known as "arresten", are absolutely final.', u'The court is banned from testing legislation against the constitution, pursuant to the principle of the sovereignty of the States-General; the court can, however, test legislation against some treaties.', u'Also, the ordinary courts in the Netherlands, including the Hoge Raad, do not deal with administrative law, which is dealt with in separate administrative courts, the highest of which is the Council of State (Raad van State)\n\n\n=== Iceland ===\nThe Supreme Court of Iceland (Icelandic: H\xe6stir\xe9ttur \xcdslands, lit.', u'Highest Court of Iceland) was founded under Act No.', u'22/1919 and held its first session on 16 February 1920.', u'The Court holds the highest judicial power in Iceland, where the court system has two levels.', u'=== India ===\nThe Supreme Court of India is also known as apex court.', u'Any decision taken by it is the last (except the president ).', u'IT has several jurisdiction like 1.', u'Original 2.Appellate 3.', u'Advisory\nIT is also known as court of records, i. e. All judgements are recorded and printed.', u'These are cited in lower courts as case - law in various cases.', u'=== Italy ===\nItaly follows the French system of different supreme courts.', u'The Italian court of last resort for most disputes is the Corte Suprema di Cassazione.', u'There is also a separate constitutional court, the Corte costituzionale, which has a duty of judicial review, and which can strike down legislation as being in conflict with the Constitution.', u'=== Japan ===\nIn Japan, the Supreme Court of Japan is called \u6700\u9ad8\u88c1\u5224\u6240 (Saik\u014d-Saibansho; called \u6700\u9ad8\u88c1 Saik\u014d-Sai for short), located in Chiyoda, Tokyo, and is the highest court in Japan.', u'It has ultimate judicial authority within Japan to interpret the Constitution and decide questions of national law (including local by laws).', u'It has the power of judicial review (i.e., it can declare Acts of Diet and Local Assembly, and administrative actions, unconstitutional).', u'=== Luxembourg ===\nIn Luxembourg, challenges on the conformity of the law to the Constitution are brought before the Cour Constitutionnelle (Constitutional Court).', u'\u2014 The most used and common procedure to present these challenges is by way of the "question pr\xe9judicielle" (prejudicial question).', u'The Court of last resort for civil and criminal proceedings is the "Cour de Cassation".', u'For administrative proceedings the highest court is the "Cour Administrative" (Administrative Court).', u'=== Macau ===\nThe supreme court of Macau is the Court of Final Appeal (Portuguese: Tribunal de \xdaltima Inst\xe2ncia; Chinese: \u6fb3\u9580\u7d42\u5be9\u6cd5\u9662).', u'=== Philippines ===\nWhile the Philippines is generally considered a civil law nation, its Supreme Court is heavily modelled after the American Supreme Court.', u'This can be attributed to the fact that the Philippines was colonized by both Spain and the United States, and the system of laws of both nations strongly influenced the development of Philippine laws and jurisprudence.', u'Even as the body of Philippine laws remain mostly codified, the Philippine Civil Code expressly recognizes that decisions of the Supreme Court "form part of the law of the land", belonging to the same class as statutes.', u'The 1987 Philippine Constitution also explicitly grants to the Supreme Court the power of judicial review over laws and executive actions.', u'The Supreme Court is composed of 1 Chief Justice and 14 Associate Justices.', u'The court sits either en banc or in divisions, depending on the nature of the case to be decided.', u"=== Peoples Republic of China ===\nIn the judicial system of mainland China the highest court of appeal is the Supreme People's Court.", u'This supervises the administration of justice by all subordinate "local" and "special" people\'s courts, and is the court of last resort for the whole People\'s Republic of China except for Macau and Hong Kong\n\n\n=== Portugal ===\nIn Portugal, there are several supreme courts, each with a specific jurisdition:\nThe Supreme Court of Justice (Supremo Tribunal de Justi\xe7a) - for judicial (civil and criminal) matters;\nThe Constitutional Court (Tribunal Constitucional) - for the constitutional matters;\nThe Supreme Administrative Court (Supremo Tribunal Administrativo) - for administrative and fiscal matters;\nThe Court of Auditors (Tribunal de Contas) - for auditing the public expenditure.', u'Until 2003, a fifth supreme court also existed for the military jurisdiction, this being the Supreme Military Court (Supremo Tribunal Militar).', u'Presently, in time of peace, the supreme court for military justice matters is the Supreme Court of Justice, which now includes four military judges.', u'=== Republic of China ===\nIn the Republic of China (Taiwan), there are three different courts of last resort:\nSupreme Court of the Republic of China (\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u9662): civil and criminal cases.', u'Supreme Administrative Court of the Republic of China (\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u6700\u9ad8\u884c\u653f\u6cd5\u9662): executive cases.', u'Council of Grand Justices (\u5927\u6cd5\u5b98\u6703\u8b70): interpretation of the Constitution, interpretation of laws and regulations, dissolution of political parties in violation of the Constitution, trial of impeachments against the President or Vice President.', u'The Council of Grand Justices, consisting of 15 justices and mainly dealing with constitutional issues, is the counterpart of constitutional courts in some countries.', u'All three courts are directly under the Judicial Yuan, whose president also serves as Chief Justice in the Council of Grand Justices.', u'=== Scotland ===\n\nFounded by papal bull in 1532, the Court of Session is the supreme civil court of Scotland, and the High Court of Justiciary is the supreme criminal court.', u'However, the absolute highest court (excluding criminal matters) is the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom.', u'=== Spain ===\n\nSpanish Supreme Court is the highest court for all cases in Spain (both private and public).', u'Only those cases related to human rights can be appealed at the Constitutional Court (which also decides about acts accordance with Spanish Constitution).', u'In Spain, high courts cannot create binding precedents; however, lower rank courts usually observe Supreme Court interpretations.', u'In most private law cases, two Supreme Court judgements supporting a claim are needed to appeal at the Supreme Court.', u'Five sections form the Spanish Supreme court:\nSection one judges private law cases (including commercial law).', u'Section two decides about criminal appeals.', u'Section three judges administrative cases and controls government normative powers.', u'Section four is dedicated to labour law.', u'Section five is dedicated to military justice.', u'=== Sweden ===\nIn Sweden, the Supreme Court and the Supreme Administrative Court respectively function as the highest courts of the land.', u'The Supreme Administrative Court considers cases concerning disputes between individuals and administrative organs, as well as disputes among administrative organs, while the Supreme Court considers all other cases.', u'The judges are appointed by the Government.', u'In most cases, the Supreme Courts will only grant leave to appeal a case (pr\xf6vningstillst\xe5nd) if the case involves setting a precedent in the interpretation of the law.', u'Exceptions are issues where the Supreme Court is the court of first instance.', u'Such cases include an application for a retrial of a criminal case in the light of new evidence, and prosecutions made against an incumbent minister of the Government for severe neglect of duty.', u'If a lower court has to try a case which involves a question where there is no settled interpretation of the law, it can also refer the question to the relevant Supreme Court for an answer.', u'=== Switzerland ===\nIn Switzerland, the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland is the final court of appeals.', u"Due to Switzerland's system of direct democracy, it has no authority to review the constitutionality of federal statutes, but the people can strike down a proposed law by referendum.", u'According to settled case law, however, the Court is authorised to review the compliance of all Swiss law with certain categories of international law, especially the European Convention of Human Rights.', u'=== Other civil law jurisdictions ===\nFor Honduras, see Supreme Court of Honduras.', u'For Peru see Supreme Court of Peru.', u'For Poland, see Supreme Court of the Republic of Poland.', u'For Uganda, see Supreme Court of Uganda\nFor Ukraine, see Supreme Court of Ukraine.', u'=== Sri Lanka ===\nIn Sri Lanka, the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka was created in 1972 after the adoption of a new Constitution.', u'The Supreme Court is the highest and final superior court of record and is empowered to exercise its powers, subject to the provisions of the Constitution.', u'The court rulings take precedence over all lower Courts.', u'The Sri Lanka judicial system is complex blend of both common-law and civil-law.', u'In some cases such as capital punishment, the decision may be passed on to the President of the Republic for clemency petitions.', u"However, when there is 2/3 majority in the parliament in favour of president (as with present), the supreme court and its judges' powers become nullified as they could be fired from their positions according to the Constitution, if the president wants.", u'Therefore, in such situations, Civil law empowerment vanishes.', u'=== South Africa ===\nIn South Africa, a "two apex" system existed from 1994 to 2013.', u'The Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) was created in 1994 and replaced the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa as the highest court of appeal in non-constitutional matters.', u'The SCA is subordinate to the Constitutional Court, which is the highest court in matters involving the interpretation and application of the Constitution.', u"But in August 2013 the Constitution was amended to make the Constitutional Court the country's single apex court, superior to the SCA in all matters, both constitutional and non-constitutional.", u'=== Thailand ===\nHistorically, citizens appealed directly to the King along his route to places out of the Palace.', u'A Thai King would adjudicate all disputes.', u'During the reign of King Chulalongkorn, an official department for appeals was set up, and, after Thailand adopted a democratic regime of government, Thai Supreme Court was established in 1891.', u'At present, the Supreme Court of Thailand retains the important status as the highest court of justice in the country.', u'Operating separately from the Administrative Court and the Constitutional Court, the judgement of the Supreme Court is considered as final.', u'=== United Arab Emirates ===\nIn the United Arab Emirates, the Federal Supreme Court of the United Arab Emirates was created in 1973 after the adoption of the Constitution.', u'The Supreme Court is the highest and final superior court of record and is empowered to exercise its powers, subject to the provisions of the Constitution.', u'The court rulings take precedence over all lower Courts.', u'The Emirati judicial system is complex blend of both Islamic law and civil law.', u'In some cases such as capital punishment, the decision may be passed on to the President of the country (currently Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan).', u'== Soviet-model jurisdictions ==\nIn most nations with constitutions modelled after the Soviet Union, the legislature was given the power of being the court of last resort.', u"In the People's Republic of China, the final power to interpret the law is vested in the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC).", u'This power includes the power to interpret the basic laws of Hong Kong and Macau, the constitutional documents of the two special administrative regions which are common law and Portuguese-based legal system jurisdictions respectively.', u'This power is a legislative power and not a judicial one in that an interpretation by the NPCSC does not affect cases which have already been decided.', u'== See also ==\nConstitutionalism\nIndependence of the judiciary\nJudiciary\nList of national supreme courts\nSeparation of

{'sentences': [u'A public transport timetable (also timetable and North American English schedule) is a document setting out information on service times, to assist passengers with planning a trip.', u'Typically, the timetable will list the times when a service is scheduled to arrive at and depart from specified locations.', u'It may show all movements at a particular location or all movements on a particular route or for a particular stop.', u'Traditionally this information was provided in printed form, for example as a leaflet or poster.', u'It is now also often available in a variety of electronic formats.', u"In the 2000s public transport route planners / intermodal journey planners have proliferated and offer traveller the convenience that the computer program looks at all timetables so the traveller doesn't need to.", u'A "timetable" may also refer to the same information in abstract form, not specifically published, e.g.', u'"A new timetable has been introduced".', u'== History ==\n\nThe first compilation of railway timetables in the United Kingdom was produced in 1839 by George Bradshaw.', u'Greater speeds and the need for more accurate timings led to the introduction of standard railway time in Great Western Railway timetables in 1840, when all their trains were scheduled to "London time", i.e.', u'Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), which replaced solar time.', u'Until railway time was introduced, local times for London, Birmingham, Bristol and Manchester could differ by as much as 16 to 20 minutes; in India and North America these differences could be 60 minutes or more.', u'The European Rail Timetable, a compendium of the schedules of major European railway services, has been in publication since 1873 (appearing monthly since 1883).', u"Originally, and for most of its history, it was published by Thomas Cook & Son and included Thomas Cook or Cook's in its title.", u'Although Thomas Cook Group plc ceased publication in 2013, the Thomas Cook European Rail Timetable was revived by a new company in early 2014 as simply the European Rail Timetable.', u'From 1981 to 2010, Cook also produced a similar bi-monthly Overseas volume covering the rest of the world, and some of that content was moved into the European Timetable in 2011.', u'== Representation ==\nA timetable can be produced dynamically, on request, for a particular journey on a particular day around a particular time (see journey planner, below), or in a timetable that gives an overview of all services in a particular category and is valid for a specified period.', u'The latter could take the form of a book, leaflet, billboard, or a (set of) computer file(s), and makes it much easier to find out, for example, whether a transport service at a particular time is offered every day at that time, and if not, on which days; with a journey planner one may have to check every day of the year separately for this.', u'=== Matrix format ===\nMany timetables comprise tables with services shown in columns, and stations or stops on the rows of the table.', u'There will often be separate tables for each direction of travel, and often separate (pairs of) tables for weekdays, Saturdays and Sundays.', u'Generally the times shown against each station or stop will be the departure time, except for the last stop of the service which will be the arrival time.', u'The left hand column will list the stations in route order, and the other columns are arranged from left to right in chronological order.', u'If the service is scheduled to wait, both arrival and departure times might be shown on consecutive rows.', u'If a slow service is overtaken by a fast service, the slow service will often occupy more than one column, to keep the times in order.', u'There may be additional rows showing connecting services.', u'Times are usually shown using the 24-hour clock, but often in the United States and occasionally in the United Kingdom the 12-hour clock is used, with "am/A" or "pm/P" added.', u'If services run at the same minutes past each hour for part of the day, the legend "and at the same minutes past each hour" or similar wording may be shown instead of individual timings.', u'Other information may be shown, often at the tops of the columns, such as day(s) of operation, validity of tickets for each service, whether seat reservations are required, the type of vehicle used (e.g.', u'for heritage railways and airline timetables), the availability of on-board facilities such as refreshments, availability of classes, and a service number.', u'Timetables with services arranged in rows of tables and stops or stations in columns are less common but otherwise similar to timetables with services in columns.', u'=== Stop-specific displays ===\nSome timetables, particularly at railway stations and bus stops, list the times that services depart from that location, sometimes with other information such as destinations and stopping conditions.', u'Again, there may be separate lists for different days of the week.', u'There may be a separate list for each line/direction, or a combined chronological list (as in the picture).', u'In parts of mainland Europe train departures are listed on a yellow poster, and arrivals on a white poster.', u'These posters are placed at entrances to stations and on platforms.', u'=== Electronic displays ===\nDynamic electronic displays in stations may be at a central place and list the next few departures for each line, or all departures in the next hour.', u'Displays on platforms usually just show the next departure (or perhaps the next few) from that platform.', u'== Formats ==\nTimetables may be printed as books, booklets, folded or plain cards or paper, posters, or hand-written on posters or blackboards, shown on back-lit displays, or published on-line or as SMS or text messages.', u'With the development of the internet and electronic systems, conventional thick paper timetables are gradually being replaced by website searching or CD-ROM style timetables, and the publication of comprehensive printed timetables is generally decreasing.', u'Transport schedule data itself is increasingly being made available to the public digitally, as specified in the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) format.', u'== Scheduling ==\n\nIn many modern public transport systems, timetables and rostering are generated by computer, with the operators specifying the required operating span, minimum frequencies, route length/time and other such factors.', u'Design of the schedule may aim to make times memorable for passengers, through the use of clock-face scheduling \u2014 services departing at regular intervals, at the same times every hour.', u'This is less likely to apply at peak times, when the priority is optimum utilisation of available vehicles and staff.', u'=== Headway services ===\nIn large cities services may be so frequent that consulting a timetable is unnecessary.', u'In some cases public transport operators do not publish public timetables for busy times of day, or they may simply state "services run every 3\u20135 minutes" (or words to that effect)\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== International timetables ==\nThomas Cook European Timetable\nA monthly timetable book of major trains, some bus and ferry

appeared in 1894, published by a private company.', u'By the time of the nationalization of Japanese railways in 1906, three competing timetables were being published and it was decided that only one official timetable should be offered to the public.', u'Five thousand copies of the first official timetable were published in January 1915.', u'In 2010, two printed national timetables were available: the Japan Tourist Bureau (JTB) Timetable (JTB\u6642\u523b\u8868) and the Japan Railways (JR) Timetable (JR\u6642\u523b\u8868\uff09.', u'These thick books - the February 2009 edition of the

frequent JR urban lines, subway trains, private railways and urban buses, only summary timetables are shown.', u'In 2009, a book was published to mark the 1000th edition of the JTB timetable, containing reproductions of all one thousand covers, selected timetables and maps, and articles on the way the timetable is produced.', u'There are also many searchable online timetables covering all

European train timetables are amended.', u'There are seldom major changes to important routes, but the change allows for alterations to international services and for seasonal variation.', u'Currently the dates for the European train timetable changes are usually the Sunday of the second weekend in June and in December.', u'In the months leading up to the changeover date booking will be restricted

0600UT to 0900UT.', u'The westbound flow generally operates within a 1200\u20131500UT time-slot.', u'Restrictions on how far a given aircraft may be from an airport also play a part in determining its route; in the past, airliners with three or more engines were not restricted, but a twin-engine airliner was required to stay within a certain distance of airports that could accommodate it (since a single engine failure in a four-engine aircraft is less crippling than a single engine failure in a twin).', u'Modern aircraft with two engines flying transatlantic (the most common models used for transatlantic service being the Airbus A330, Boeing 767 and Boeing 777) have to be ETOPS certified.', u"Gaps in air traffic control and radar coverage over large stretches of the Earth's oceans, as well as an absence of most types of radio navigation aids, impose a requirement for a high level of autonomy in navigation upon transatlantic flights.", u"Aircraft must include reliable systems that can determine the aircraft's course and position with great accuracy over long distances.", u'In addition to the traditional compass, inertials and satellite navigation systems such as GPS all have their place in transatlantic navigation.', u'Land-based systems such as VOR and DME, because they operate "line of sight", are mostly useless for ocean crossings, except in initial and final legs within about 240 nautical miles (440 km) of those facilities.', u'In the late 1950s and early 1960s an important facility for low-flying aircraft was the Radio Range.', u'Inertial navigation systems

restaurants were located on "R" deck) to make way for Jacques Cousteau\'s new Living Sea Museum.', u'This increased museum space to 400,000 square feet (37,000 m2).', u'It required removal of all the boiler rooms, the forward engine room, both turbo generator rooms, the ship stabilisers, and the water softening plant.', u"The ship's empty fuel tanks were filled with local mud to keep the ship's centre of gravity and draft at the correct levels, as these critical factors had been affected by the removal of the various components and structure.", u'Only the aft engine room and "shaft alley", at the stern of the ship, would be spared.', u'Remaining space would be used for storage or office space.', u'One problem that arose during the conversion was a dispute between land-based and maritime unions over conversion jobs.', u'The United States Coast Guard had final say.', u'Queen Mary was deemed a building, since most of her propellers had been removed and her machinery gutted.', u'The ship was also repainted with its red water level paint at a slightly higher level than previously.', u'During the conversion the funnels were removed, as this area was needed to lift out the scrap materials from the engine and boiler rooms.', u'Workers found that the funnels were significantly degraded and they were replaced with replicas.', u'With all of the lower decks nearly gutted from R deck and down, Diners Club, the initial lessee of the ship, converted the remainder of the vessel into a hotel.', u'Diners Club Queen Mary dissolved and vacated the ship in 1970 after their parent company, Diners Club International, was sold, and a change in corporate direction was mandated during the conversion process.', u'Specialty Restaurants, a Los Angeles-based company that focused on theme-based restaurants, took over as master lessee the following year.', u'This second plan was based on converting most of her first- and second-class cabins on A and B decks into hotel rooms, and converting the main lounges and dining rooms into banquet spaces.', u"On Promenade Deck, the starboard promenade was enclosed to feature an upscale restaurant and caf\xe9 named Lord Nelson's and Lady Hamilton's; it was themed in the fashion of early-19th-century sailing ships.", u'The famed and elegant Observation Bar was redecorated as a western-themed bar.', u'The smaller first-class public rooms, such as the Drawing Room, Library, Lecture Room and the Music studio, would be stripped of most of their fittings and converted to commercial use.', u'This markedly expanded retail space on the ship.', u"Two more shopping malls were built on the Sun Deck in separate spaces previously used for first-class cabins and engineers' quarters.", u'A post-war feature of the ship, the first-class cinema, was removed for kitchen space for the new Promenade Deck dining venues.', u'The first-class lounge and smoking room were reconfigured and converted into banquet space.', u'The second-class smoking room was subdivided into a wedding chapel and office space.', u'On the Sun Deck, the elegant Verandah Grill would be gutted and converted into a fast-food eatery, while a new upscale dining venue was created directly above it on Sports Deck, in space once used for crew quarters.', u'The second-class lounges were expanded to the sides of the ship and used for banqueting.', u'On R deck, the first-class dining room was reconfigured and subdivided into two banquet venues, the Royal Salon and the Windsor Room.', u'The second-class dining room was subdivided into kitchen storage and a crew mess hall, while the third-class dining room was initially used as storage and crew space.', u'Also on R deck, the first-class Turkish bath complex, the 1930s equivalent to a spa, was removed.', u'The second-class pool was removed and its space initially used for office space, while the first-class swimming pool was used for hotel guests.', u'Combined with modern safety codes and the structural soundness of the area directly below, the swimming pool is no longer in use.', u'No crew cabins remain intact aboard the ship today.', u'=== As a tourist attraction ===\n\nOn 8 May 1971 Queen Mary opened her doors to tourists.', u"Initially, only portions of the ship were open to the public as Specialty Restaurants had yet to open its dining venues and PSA had not completed work converting the ship's original First Class staterooms into the hotel.", u'As a result, the ship was open only on weekends.', u"On 11 December 1971 Jacques Cousteau's Museum of the Sea opened, with a quarter of the planned exhibits completed.", u"Within the decade, Cousteau's museum closed due to low ticket sales and the deaths of many of the fish that were housed in the museum.", u"On 2 November 1972 PSA's hotel opened its initial 150 guest rooms.", u'Two years later, with all 400 rooms finished, PSA brought in Hyatt Hotels to manage the hotel.', u'It operated the facility from 1974 to 1980 as the Queen Mary Hyatt Hotel.', u'By 1980, it had become apparent that the existing system was not working.', u'The ship was losing millions each year for the city because the hotel, restaurants and museum were run by three separate concessionaires, while the city owned the vessel and operated guided tours.', u'It was decided that a single operator with more experience in attractions was needed.', u'Jack Wrather, a local millionaire, had fallen in love with the ship because he and his wife, Bonita Granville, had fond memories of sailing on it numerous times.', u'Wrather signed a 66-year lease with the city of Long Beach to operate the entire property.', u'He oversaw the display of the Spruce Goose, on long-term loan.', u'The immense plane, which had been sitting in a hangar in Long Beach for decades unseen by the public, was installed in a huge geodesic dome adjacent to the liner in 1983, attracting increased attendance.', u'His Wrather Port Properties operated the entire attraction after his death in 1984 until 1988, when his holdings were bought by the Walt Disney Company.', u'Wrather had built the Disneyland Hotel in 1955, when Walt Disney had insufficient funds to construct the resort himself.', u'Disney had been trying to buy the hotel for 30 years.', u'When they finally succeeded, they also acquired the Queen Mary.', u'This was never marketed as a Disney property.', u'Through the late 1980s and early 1990s the Queen Mary struggled financially.', u'Disney pinned their hopes for turning the attraction around on Port Disney, a huge planned resort on the adjacent docks.', u"It was to include a theme park known as DisneySea, themed around the world's oceans.", u'The plans eventually fell through; in 1992 Disney gave up the lease on the ship to focus on building what would become Disney California Adventure Park.', u'The DisneySea concept was recycled a decade later in Japan as Tokyo DisneySea, with a recreated ocean liner resembling Queen Mary named the SS Columbia as the centerpiece of the American Waterfront area.', u'With Disney gone, the Hotel Queen Mary closed on 30 September 1992.', u'The owners of the Spruce Goose, the Aero Club of Southern California, sold the plane to the Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum in Oregon.', u'The plane departed on barges on 2 October 1992, leaving the huge dome empty.', u'The Queen Mary tourist attraction remained open for another two months, but on 31 December 1992, the Queen Mary completely closed her doors to tourists and visitors.', u'On 5 February 1993, RMS Foundation, Inc signed a five-year lease with the city of Long Beach to act as the operators of the property.', u'The foundation was run by President and C.E.O.', u'Joseph F. Prevratil, who had managed the attraction for Wrather.', u'On 26 February 1993 the tourist attraction reopened completely, while the hotel reopened partially on 5 March with 125 rooms and the banquet facilities, with the remainder of the rooms coming on line on 30 April.', u"In 1995, RMS Foundation's lease was extended to twenty years, while the scope of the lease was reduced to operation of the ship.", u"A new company, Queen's Seaport Development, Inc. (QSDI), was established in 1995 to control the real estate adjacent to the vessel.", u'In 1998, the City of Long Beach extended the QSDI lease to 66 years.', u'In 2005, QSDI sought Chapter 11 protection due to a rent credit dispute with the City.', u'In 2006, the bankruptcy court requested bids from parties interested in taking over the lease from QSDI.', u'The minimum required opening bid was $41M.', u'The operation of the ship, by RMS Foundation, remained independent of the bankruptcy.', u'In Summer 2007, Queen Mary\'s lease was sold to a group named "Save the Queen," managed by Hostmark Hospitality Group.', u'They planned to develop the land adjacent to Queen Mary, and upgrade, renovate, and restore the ship.', u"During their management, staterooms were updated with iPod docking stations and flatscreen TVs, and the ship's three funnels and waterline area were repainted their original Cunard Red color.", u"The portside Promenade Deck's planking was restored and refinished.", u"Many lifeboats were repaired and patched, and the ship's kitchens were renovated with new equipment.", u"In 2004, Queen Mary and Stargazer Productions added Tibbies Great American Cabaret to the space previously occupied by the ship's bank and wireless telegraph room.", u'Stargazer Productions and Queen Mary transformed the space into a working dinner theatre complete with stage, lights, sound, and scullery.', u'In late September 2009, management of Queen Mary was taken over by Delaware North Companies, who plan to continue restoration and renovation of the ship and its property.', u'They were determined to revitalise and enhance the ship as an attraction.', u'But in April 2011, The City Of Long Beach was informed that Delaware North was no longer managing Queen Mary.', u'Garrison Investment Group said this decision was purely business.', u'Delaware North still manages Scorpion, a Soviet submarine that has been a separate attraction next to Queen Mary since 1998.', u'Evolution Hospitality, LLC.', u'assumed operational control of the Queen Mary on 23 September 2011, with Garrison Investments leasing Queen Mary.', u'In 2016 Urban Commons, a real estate company, assumed the lease of the Queen Mary.', u'They revealed plans to extensively renovate the liner over the next year, and to redevelop the adjacent 45 acres of parking with a boutique hotel, restaurants, a marina, an amphitheater, jogging trails, bike paths, and possibly a huge Ferris wheel, all at a cost of up to $250 million.', u'=== Meeting of the Queens ===\n\nOn 23 February 2006, RMS Queen Mary 2 saluted her predecessor as she made a port of call in Los Angeles Harbor, while on a cruise to Mexico.', u'On March 2011, Queen Mary was saluted by the MS Queen Victoria while fireworks were going on, and on 12 March 2013, the MS Queen Elizabeth made a salute while there were fireworks.', u'The salute was carried out with Queen Mary replying with her one working air horn in response to Queen Mary 2 sounding her combination of two brand new horns and an original 1934 Queen Mary horn (on loan from the City of Long Beach).', u'Queen Mary originally had three whistles tuned to 55 Hz, a frequency chosen because it was low enough that the extremely loud sound of it would not be painful to human ears.', u"Modern IMO regulations specify ships' horn frequencies to be in the range 70\u2013200 Hz for vessels that are over 200 metres (660 ft) in length.", u'Traditionally, the lower the frequency, the larger the ship.', u'Queen Mary 2, being 345 metres (1,132 ft) long, was given the lowest possible frequency (70 Hz) for her regulation whistles, in addition to the refurbished 55 Hz whistle on permanent loan.', u'Fifty-five Hz is the "A" note an octave above the lowest note of a standard piano keyboard.', u'The air-driven Tyfon whistle can be heard at least 10 miles (16 km) away.', u"=== W6RO ===\nQueen Mary's original, professionally manned wireless radio room was removed when the ship was moored in Long Beach.", u'In its place, an amateur radio room was created one deck above the original radio reception room, with some of the discarded original radio equipment used for display purposes.', u'The amateur radio station, with the call sign W6RO ("Whiskey Six Romeo Oscar"), relies on volunteers from a local amateur radio club.', u'They staff the radio room during most public hours.', u'The radios can also be used by other licensed amateur radio operators.', u'In honour of his over forty years of dedication to W6RO and Queen Mary, in November 2007 the Queen Mary Wireless Room was renamed as the Nate Brightman Radio Room.', u"This was announced on 28 October 2007, at Brightman's 90th birthday party by Joseph Prevratil, former President and CEO of the Queen Mary.", u"=== Rumors of hauntings ===\nFollowing Queen Mary's permanent docking in California, the ship was rumored to be haunted.", u'Since the 1980s, this supposed haunting has been featured in the marketing and promotion of the ship, with various attractions and tours presenting the theme for visitors.', u'The ship was ranked as "one of the top 10 most haunted places in America" by Time Magazine in 2008.', u"In particular, Cabin B340 (formerly Cabin B326, prior to the ship's refitting after World War II) is alleged to be haunted by the spirit of a person who was murdered there.", u'Individuals have reported hearing sounds of children playing in the nursery.', u'Other reported ghosts include a young sailor who was accidentally killed in the ship\'s engine room, crewmembers of the Curacoa who were killed when Queen Mary collided with her, and an unidentified "lady in white".', u'At least one book has been written on the subject.', u"At least 49 crew and passengers are known to have died during the Queen Mary's service as a luxury liner.", u"Although many hauntings are reported as the ghosts of drowning victims, the ship's logs do not record any instances of passengers drowning.", u'Approximately 75% of the deaths were crew members, and about 25% were passengers.', u'It is unknown how many servicemen or POWs died aboard the Queen Mary during her stint as a troop transport ship in World War II.', u'Paranormal researcher John Champion writes in Skeptical Inquirer Magazine that he understands why people persist in believing that the Queen Mary is haunted when the only evidence given is anecdotes, creepy feelings and shadows.', u'Tourists who sign up for the haunted tour are given access to normally off limit areas of the ship, while tours of the history of the ship are more limited.', u'Champion believes that the owners are doing a disservice to the real history, the people who should be honored "by remembering who they really were and what they actually did".', u"He understands why people report strange occurrences, the ship still creaks and groans, and people's imaginations can get away from them such that they start seeing and hearing all kinds of things, attributing them to the paranormal which they have been primed for.", u'"Ghost stories are fine", concludes Champion "when presented as such.', u'The confusion of science and history with fiction ... gets us further away from the ability to relish in and truly explore our own recent history."', u'The ship has been the site of many paranormal television shows including Ghost Hunters, Ghost Adventures, Fact or Faked and Most Haunted.', u'== See also ==\n\nRMS Mauretania (1938)\nMS Queen Elizabeth\nMS Queen Victoria\nRMS St Helena, one of the last Royal Mail Ships\n\n\n==

multi-day space flight by the United States, designed to show that it was possible for humans to remain in space for extended lengths of time.', u'The four-day, 66-orbit flight would approach but not break the five-day record set by the Soviet Vostok 5 in June 1963.', u'Subsequent Gemini flights would be longer, to prove endurance exceeding the time required to fly to the Moon and back.', u'A second objective was the first American extra-vehicular activity (EVA), known popularly as a "space walk".', u'The first space walk had already been performed by Soviet Alexei Leonov on Voskhod 2 in March 1965.', u'NASA moved up the spacewalk from the original schedule, to demonstrate that the US was gaining on the early lead taken by the Soviets in what was known as the Space Race.', u'As late as 11 days before the scheduled June 3 launch, newspapers were reporting that NASA was saying it "had not yet determined whether White would be the first American astronaut to expose himself to the elements of space," and that "A decision might not be made until a day or two before launching."', u'A third objective was for Gemini 4 to attempt the first space rendezvous, flying in formation with the spent second stage of its Titan II launch vehicle.', u"== Flight ==\n\n\n=== Launch ===\n\nLaunched from LC-19 at Cape Kennedy Air Force Station, Florida, Gemini 4 was the first flight to be controlled by the new Mission Control Center at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, Texas, which had to conduct three-shift operations due to the flight's long duration.", u'The broadcast of the launch was itself historic.', u'For the first time an international audience, from 12 European nations, could watch the lift-off on live television via the Early Bird satellite.', u'Press interest, due to the satellite broadcast and the new center in Houston, proved to be so high that NASA had to lease buildings to accommodate the 1,100 print and broadcast journalists who requested accreditation.', u'Flight control shifted from Cape Kennedy to Houston as soon as the vehicle cleared the launch tower.', u'Except for a few moments of pogo oscillation (axial vibrations in the rocket), the launch came off perfectly, the spacecraft entering into an 87-by-153-nautical-mile (161 by 283 km) orbit.', u'=== Rendezvous attempt ===\nOn the first orbit, McDivitt attempted to rendezvous with the spent Titan second stage.', u'This was unsuccessful for a number of reasons:\nNASA engineers had not yet worked out the idiosyncrasies of orbital mechanics involved in rendezvous, which are counter-intuitive.', u'Simply thrusting the spacecraft toward the target changed its orbital altitude and velocity relative to the target.', u'When McDivitt tried this, he found himself moving away and downward, as the retrograde thrust lowered his orbit, increasing his speed.', u'The stage was dumping its residual propellant, causing it to move around in various directions relative to the Gemini.', u'There were only two running lights on the stage, which made it hard at times for McDivitt to determine its orientation.', u'McDivitt concluded that a rendezvous target should have at least three lights.', u'There was no radar on board Gemini 4 to give a precise range to the target, so the astronauts had to rely on their visual depth perception to estimate the range, and this differed for the two men.', u'Initially McDivitt estimated the distance at 400\u2013500 feet (120\u2013150 m), while White believed it was closer ("a little over 200 feet (61 m)").', u"At the worst point, McDivitt estimated it was about a half mile (800 meters) away, while White's estimate was three-quarters of a mile (1200 meters).", u"McDivitt estimated he was able to get as close as 200 feet (61 m), but now White's estimate was between 850 and 1,000 feet (260 and 300 m).", u'After expending almost half his thruster fuel, McDivitt finally gave up, in order to concentrate on the more important EVA objective.', u'(Rendezvous was finally achieved successfully by Wally Schirra commanding Gemini 6A in December.)', u"After the rendezvous, Gemini 4's orbit was now 89.2 by 155 nautical miles (165.2 by 287.1 km).", u'Twenty-two hours into the mission, Mission Control estimated the orbit would decay to 81 by 125.7 nautical miles (150.0 by 232.8 km) at the end of 63 revolutions.', u'=== Extra-vehicular activity (EVA) ===\n\nOriginally planned for the second revolution, the astronauts postponed the EVA until the third after McDivitt decided that White, following the stress of the launch and the failed rendezvous, looked tired and hot.', u'After a rest, the pair finished performing the checklist for the EVA.', u'Flying over Carnarvon, Australia, they began to depressurize the cabin.', u'Over Hawaii, White pulled the handle to open his hatch, but the latches failed to move.', u'Fortunately, McDivitt knew what the problem was, because the hatch had failed to close in a vacuum chamber test on the ground, after which McDivitt worked with a technician to see what the cause was.', u'A spring, which forced gears to engage in the mechanism, had failed to compress, and McDivitt got to see how the mechanism worked.', u'In flight, he was able to help White get it open, and thought he could get it to latch again.', u'There were communication problems during the spacewalk.', u"Gemini spacecraft were the first to use a voice-operated switch (known as VOX) on the astronaut's microphones, but McDivitt soon realized his VOX circuit wasn't working properly; he could only hear the Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM) in the push-to-talk setting, but not on VOX (though both astronauts could be heard by each other and the ground.)", u'Plus, while outside the spacecraft, White was unable to receive transmissions from the ground and had to have all messages relayed through McDivitt.', u'McDivitt must have switched to the VOX setting somewhere around the time White was exiting the spacecraft, because at that point, for most of the EVA, neither he nor White responded either to the Hawaii CAPCOM, or to the Houston CAPCOM, Gus Grissom.', u'Grissom tried to talk to Gemini 4 a total of 40 times in 13 minutes before he got a response.', u'Tied to a tether, White floated out of the spacecraft, using a Hand-Held Maneuvering Unit (informally called a "zip gun") which expelled pressurized oxygen to provide thrust for controlling his travel.', u'He went fifteen feet (five meters) out, and began to experiment with maneuvering.', u'He found it easy, especially the pitch and yaw, although he thought the roll would use too much gas.', u'He maneuvered around the spacecraft while McDivitt took photographs.', u'White enjoyed the experience, but exhausted the HHMU gas sooner than he would have liked.', u'White was running up against two factors which constrained the time for his EVA: loss of signal from the Bermuda tracking station, and crossing the solar terminator.', u"The flight controllers were becoming increasingly frustrated with their inability to remind White of the time constraint, because they didn't want the first EVA to be performed in darkness, or out of communication with Earth.", u"Finally McDivitt decided to take his microphone off of VOX:\nMcDivitt, to White: I'm going out to PUSH-TO-TALK and see what the Flight Director has got to say.", u'Flight Director Chris Kraft, to Grissom: The flight director says, get back in!', u'(Kraft was not on the air-to-ground loop with the astronauts.)', u'McDivitt: Gus, this is Jim.', u'Got any message for us?', u'Grissom: Gemini 4, get back in!', u'McDivitt: Okay.', u'... (to White): ...', u'They want you to come back in now.', u'White tried to use taking more pictures as an excuse to stay out longer, and McDivitt had to coax him in.', u'He finally came back in after a total of approximately 20 minutes.', u'He said, "It\'s the saddest moment of my life."', u'By the time he got in, the spacecraft had entered darkness.', u'The hatch proved to be as stubborn to relatch as it was to open.', u"This would have been disastrous, resulting in both men's deaths on reentry.", u'But McDivitt was able to fix the mechanism once again, so White could close it.', u"The mission plan called for opening the hatch again to throw out White's now-unnecessary EVA equipment, but McDivitt elected not to do this, instead keeping the unnecessary equipment on board for the rest of the flight.", u"They powered down the spacecraft's maneuvering system, intending to drift for the next two-and-a-half days to conserve the remaining fuel.", u'They also intended to sleep alternate four-hour periods, but this turned out to be extremely difficult with the constant radio communications and the small cabin, about the size of the front seats of a compact car.', u"White's 20-minute space walk was the mission's highlight, with McDivitt's photographs being published worldwide.", u"These also showed White wearing an Omega 'Speedmaster' chronograph watch on his spacesuit sleeve, one of two makes which had been approved by NASA for space use following extensive tests.", u"Omega were unaware of these tests or the fact that their product was going to be used in space, until they saw McDivitt's photos.", u'The model worn during the spacewalk is now known as the "Ed White" by watch collectors.', u'=== Experiments ===\nEleven experiments were carried on the spacecraft:\nExperiment D-8 used five dosimeters to measure the radiation in the spacecraft environment.', u'Of particular interest was the South Atlantic Anomaly.', u'Experiment D-9 was an experiment in simple spacecraft navigation where the crew used a sextant to measure their position using the stars.', u'The objective was to investigate the feasibility of using this technique for lunar flights on the Apollo program.', u'Experiments S-5 and S-6 were both photography experiments where they used a 70-millimeter Hasselblad camera to photograph the weather and terrain below them.', u'There were two medical experiments: M-3 and M-4.', u'The first was a bungee cord that the crew used for exercise.', u'They said, after the mission, that this got harder as the mission went on, though this may have been due to a lack of sleep.', u'The second was the phonocardiogram experiment, which had sensors attached to their bodies that measured heartbeat rates, especially during liftoff, EVA, and reentry.', u'There were four engineering experiments:\nMSC-1 measured the electrostatic charge in the spacecraft,\nMSC-2 was a proton-electron spectrometer,\nMSC-3 was a tri-axis magnetometer and\nMSC-10 involved the crew photographing the red-blue Earth limb.', u'=== Reentry ===\n\nThe computer failed on the 48th revolution.', u'This was unfortunate for IBM which had just put an advertisement in the Wall Street Journal saying that its computers were so reliable that even NASA used them.', u'The computer failure meant that the capsule would not be able to perform a closed-loop lifting reentry as planned.', u'Reentry came on the 62nd revolution.', u'An open-loop rolling reentry (as used in Mercury) had to be used because of the computer failure.', u'The astronauts began rolling the spacecraft at 65 nautical miles (120 km) altitude to increase its stability.', u'They started slowing the roll rate at 89,000 feet (27 km) and stopped it by 39,000 feet (12 km).', u'The drogue parachute deployed shortly after this, and the main deployed at 10,600 feet (3.2 km).', u'A malfunctioning thruster caused the roll to be much faster than planned, and the landing was rough.', u"Neither of the crew encountered any problems, however, contrary to NASA doctors' concerns about their landing upright \u2014 as opposed to on their backs, as in Mercury \u2014 after four days in space.", u'Even though they landed 43 nautical miles (80 km) short of the intended landing target, some ships had already started steaming to the touchdown point and a helicopter was able to see them land.', u'The prime recovery ship was USS Wasp.', u'The recovery was supported by 10,249 U.S. Department of Defense personnel, 134 aircraft, and 26 ships.', u"== Insignia ==\n\nGemini 4's crew originally intended to call their spacecraft American Eagle, but this was rejected after NASA management issued a memo saying that they did not want a repeat performance of the previous mission, on which Gus Grissom had named his spacecraft Molly Brown.", u'The callsign for the mission became simply Gemini 4.', u"There was no patch flown on the crew's suits, although the one shown here, created after the fact, is on display in McDivitt's museum.", u'Since McDivitt and White were prohibited from naming their spacecraft, they decided to put the American flag on their suits, the first astronauts to do so, although Soviet crews wore the Cyrillic "\u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420" on their spacesuit helmets.', u'Previous astronauts had only had the NASA insignia and a strip with their name on their suits.', u'The flight

u'On 11 September 1972, Ugandan dictator Idi Amin sent a telegram to Waldheim, copies of which went to Yasser Arafat and Golda Meir.', u'In the telegram, Amin "applauded the massacre of the Israeli Olympic athletes in Munich and said Germany was the most appropriate locale for this because it was where Hitler burned more than six million Jews."', u'Amin also called "to expel Israel from the United Nations and to send all the Israelis to Britain, which bore the guilt for creating the Jewish state."', u'Amidst international protest, "the UN spokesman said [in his daily press conference] it was not the secretary-general\'s practice to comment on telegrams sent him by heads of government.', u'He added that the secretary-general condemned any form of racial discrimination and genocide."', u'After Operation Entebbe on 7 July 1976 \u2014 where Israeli commandos freed more than 100 Israeli and Jewish passengers held captive in Entebbe Airport (Uganda\'s main airport) by Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and German Revolutionary Cells fighters protected by forces of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, and where all the hijackers, three hostages and 45 Ugandan soldiers were killed \u2014 Waldheim described the raid as a "serious violation of the national sovereignty of a United Nations member state".', u'Waldheim was appointed again in 1976 despite some opposition.', u'Waldheim and then-U.S. President Jimmy Carter both prepared written statements for inclusion on the Voyager Golden Records, now in deep space.', u'He was the first Secretary-General to visit North Korea, in 1979.', u'In 1980, Waldheim flew to Iran in an attempt to negotiate the release of the American hostages held in Tehran, but Ayatollah Khomeini refused to see him.', u"While in Tehran, it was announced that an attempt on Waldheim's life had been foiled.", u'Near the end of his tenure as Secretary-General, Waldheim and Paul McCartney organized a series of concerts for the People of Kampuchea to help Cambodia recover from the damage done by Pol Pot.', u"China vetoed Waldheim's candidature, and he was succeeded by Javier P\xe9rez de Cu\xe9llar of Peru.", u'== Presidency of Austria ==\n\n\n=== Election and Waldheim Affair ===\nWaldheim had unsuccessfully sought election as President of Austria in 1971, but his second attempt on 8 June 1986 proved successful.', u'During his campaign for the presidency in 1985, the events started that marked the beginning of what became known internationally as the "Waldheim affair".', u"Before the presidential elections, investigative journalist Alfred Worm revealed in the Austrian weekly news magazine Profil that there had been several omissions about Waldheim's life between 1938 and 1945 in his recently published autobiography.", u'A short time later, the World Jewish Congress alleged that Waldheim had lied about his service as an officer in the mounted corps of the SA, and his time as an ordnance officer for Army Group E in Saloniki, Greece, from 1942 to 1943 based on files from the United Nations War Crimes Commission.', u'Waldheim called the allegations "pure lies and malicious acts".', u'Nevertheless, he admitted that he had known about German reprisals against partisans: "Yes, I knew.', u'I was horrified.', u'But what could I do?', u'I had either to continue to serve or be executed."', u'He said that he had never fired a shot or even seen a partisan.', u'His former immediate superior at the time stated that Waldheim had "remained confined to a desk".', u'Former Austrian chancellor Bruno Kreisky, of Jewish origin, denounced the actions of the World Jewish Congress as an "extraordinary infamy", adding that Austrians would not "allow the Jews abroad to ... tell us who should be our President."', u"Part of the reason for the controversy was Austria's refusal to address its national role in the Holocaust.", u'(Many leading Nazis, including Adolf Hitler, were Austrians, and Austria became part of the Third Reich.)', u'Austria refused to pay compensation to Nazi victims, and from 1970 onwards refused to investigate Austrian citizens who were senior Nazis.', u'Stolen Jewish art remained public property until after the Waldheim affair.', u'Because the revelations leading to the Waldheim affair came shortly before the presidential election, there has been speculation about the background of the affair.', u'Declassified CIA documents show that the CIA had been aware of his wartime past since 1945.', u"Information about Waldheim's wartime past was also previously published by a pro-German Austrian newspaper, Salzburger Volksblatt, during the 1971 presidential election campaign, including the claim of an SS membership, but the matter was supposedly regarded as unimportant or even advantageous for the candidate at that time.", u'It has been asserted that his wartime past and the discrepancies in his autobiography, In the Eye of the Storm, must have been well-known to both superpowers before he was elected UN Secretary General, and there were rumours that the KGB had blackmailed him during his UN time (for example here and here).', u'In 1994, former Mossad officer Victor Ostrovsky claimed in his book The Other Side of Deception that Mossad doctored the file of the then UN Secretary General to implicate him in Nazi crimes.', u'These allegedly false documents were subsequently "discovered" by Benjamin Netanyahu in the UN file and triggered the "Waldheim Affair".', u"Ostrovsky says it was motivated by Waldheim's criticism of Israel's war in Lebanon.", u'Controversy surrounds Ostrovsky because many of his revelations have not been sourced or otherwise confirmed, leading several critics to say that most of his work (including TOSOD) is fictional.', u"Ostrovsky's service in Mossad was confirmed when the Israeli government unsuccessfully attempted to stop publication of the book.", u"=== The International Committee of Historians and allegations of Nazi war crimes ===\nIn view of the ongoing international controversy, the Austrian government decided to appoint an international committee of historians to examine Waldheim's life between 1938 and 1945.", u'Their report found no evidence of any personal involvement in those crimes.', u'Although Waldheim had stated that he was unaware of any crimes taking place, the committee cited evidence that Waldheim must have known about war crimes.', u'In response to Waldheim\'s denial that he knew about war crimes, Simon Wiesenthal stated that Waldheim was stationed 5 miles (8.0 km) from Salonika while, over the course of several weeks, the Jewish community, which formed one-third of the population there, was sent to Auschwitz:\n\nI could only reply what the committee of historians likewise made clear in its report: "I cannot believe you."', u'Wiesenthal stated the committee found no evidence that Waldheim took part in any war crimes but was guilty of lying about his military record.', u'The International Committee in February 1988 concluded that he could not stop what was going on in Yugoslavia and Greece even if he knew:\n\nIn favour of Waldheim is, that he only had very minor possibilities to act against the injustices happening.', u'Actions against these, depending on which level the resistance occurred, were of very different importance.', u'For a young member of the staff, who did not have any military authority on the army group level, the practical possibilities for resistance were very limited and with a high probability would not have led to any actual results.', u'Resistance would have been limited to a formal protest or on the refusal to serve any longer in the army, which would have seemed to be a courageous act, however would have not led to any practical achievement.', u'=== Foreign visits ===\nThroughout his term as President (1986\u20131992), Kurt Waldheim and his wife Elisabeth were officially deemed personae non gratae by the United States.', u'== Later years and death ==\n\nAfter his term ended in 1992, Waldheim did not seek re-election.', u'The same year, he was made an honorary member of K.H.V.', u'Welfia Klosterneuburg, a Roman Catholic student fraternity a part of the Austrian Cartellverband.', u'In 1994, Pope John Paul II awarded Waldheim a knighthood in the Order of Pius IX and his wife a papal honor.', u'He died on 14 June 2007, from heart failure.', u'On 23 June, his funeral was held at St. Stephen\'s Cathedral, Vienna, and he was buried at the Presidential Vault in the Zentralfriedhof ("central cemetery").', u'In his speech at the Cathedral, Federal President Heinz Fischer called Waldheim "a great Austrian" who had been wrongfully accused of having committed war crimes.', u'Fischer also praised Waldheim for his efforts to solve international crises and for his contributions to world peace.', u"At Waldheim's own request, no foreign heads of states or governments were invited to attend his funeral except Hans-Adam II, the Prince of Liechtenstein.", u'Also present was Luis Durnwalder, governor of the Italian province of South Tyrol.', u'Japan and Syria were the only two countries that laid wreaths on his grave.', u"Ban Ki-Moon, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, issued a message 'voicing sadness'.", u'In a two-page letter, published posthumously by the Austrian Press Agency the day after he died, Waldheim admitted making "mistakes" ("but these were certainly not those of a follower let alone an accomplice of a criminal regime") and asked his critics for forgiveness.', u"== Media references ==\nW. G. Sebald's novel The Rings of Saturn (1995; English trans., 1998) refers to Waldheim, though not by name.", u'As a much-heralded invited guest on Dame Edna Everage\'s talk show The Dame Edna Experience, a dignified "Kurt Waldheim" began a grand entrance, except that halfway down the staircase, he abruptly fell through a hidden chute and disappeared: the band\'s fanfare stopped as Dame Edna explained she had decided at the last minute to "abort" Dr. Waldheim\'s appearance because it would have been "too political".', u'The episode aired 12 September 1987.', u'A running segment on The Howard Stern Show is called Guess Who\'s the Jew and features Fred Norris portraying a Nazi Kurt Waldheim, Jr.\nMusician Lou Reed\'s 1989 New York album contains a song called "Good Evening Mr.', u'Waldheim."', u'Harry Turtledove\'s 2003 alternate history novel, In the Presence of Mine Enemies, in which Germany won the Second World War, a "Kurt Haldweim" is the third F\xfchrer of Germany, and parts of Haldweim\'s biography closely parallel Waldheim\'s.', u'For instance, both Waldheim and Haldweim were born in Austria in 1918 and served in the Wehrmacht in Salonica during World War II.', u'In a 1988 ice hockey film entitled Hockey, The Lighter Side, former New York Rangers goaltender John Davidson is explaining his fictional goaltender school, and as hockey highlights play, he exclaims, "You\'ll have more shots taken at you than Kurt Waldheim."', u'In episode 3, series 2 of The Million Pound Radio Show, Andy Hamilton announces next week\'s special guest as Waldheim, "although he\'ll deny [his appearance on the show] in 40 years time."', u'During the filming of Schindler\'s List, comedian Robin Williams cheered director Steven Spielberg with a spoof telemarketing call from "the Waldheimers Association, a society devoted to helping raise money to help older Germans who had forgotten everything before 1945."', u'In an episode of The New Statesman, aired in 1989, Alan B\'Stard (Rik Mayall) attempts to blackmail an aged former Nazi officer, who complains that, "it\'s not fair; I\'m living here in the tripe capital of Europe, while Kurt Waldheim is President of Austria \u2014 and he was beneath me!"', u"American poet Srikanth Reddy's 2011 book Voyager presents a collection of poems and fragments created by erasing large sections of Waldheim's memoir In the Eye of the Storm.", u'Graphic novel and film Persepolis (comics) by Marjane Satrapi reference the election in Austria.', u'In the 2015 fiction novel The Lady From Zagreb by Philip Kerr, the protagonist, Captain Bernie Gunther, encounters a young Intelligence Officer, Lieutenant Kurt Waldheim while on a mission in Yugoslavia in 1942.', u"In the 2015 film Woman in Gold, Hubertus Czernin shows Maria Altmann an issue of Profil uncovering Waldheim's Nazi past.", u'== Further reading ==\nBassett, Richard (1988).', u'Waldheim and Austria, Penguin Books.', u'ISBN 978-0-14-013019-5\nHerzstein, Robert Edwin (1988).', u'Waldheim, the Missing Years.', u'First ed.', u'New York: W.

union of multiple subnational Soviet republics, its government and economy were highly centralized.', u'The Soviet Union was a one-party federation, governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital.', u'The Soviet Union had its roots in the October Revolution of 1917, when the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, overthrew the provisional government that had replaced the Tsar.', u'They established the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic (renamed Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in 1936), beginning a civil war between the revolutionary "Reds" and the counter-revolutionary "Whites."', u'The Red Army entered several territories of the former Russian Empire and helped local Communists take power through soviets, which nominally acted on behalf of workers and peasants.', u'In 1922, the Communists were victorious, forming the Soviet Union with the unification of the Russian, Transcaucasian, Ukrainian, and Byelorussian republics.', u"Following Lenin's death in 1924, a troika and a brief power struggle, Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s.", u'Stalin suppressed all political opposition to his rule, committed the state ideology to Marxism\u2013Leninism (which he created), and initiated a centrally planned command economy.', u'As a result, the country underwent a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization which laid the foundation for its victory in World War II and post-war dominance of Eastern Europe.', u'Stalin also fomented political paranoia, and conducted the Great Purge to remove opponents of his from the Communist Party through the mass arbitrary arrest of many people (military leaders, Communist Party members, and ordinary citizens alike) who were then sent to correctional labor camps or sentenced to death.', u'Shortly before World War II, Stalin signed the non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany, after which the two countries invaded Poland in September 1939.', u'In June 1941 the Germans invaded, opening the largest and bloodiest theater of war in history.', u'Soviet war casualties accounted for the highest proportion of the conflict in the cost of acquiring the upper hand over Axis forces at intense battles such as Stalingrad.', u'Soviet forces eventually captured Berlin in 1945.', u'The territory overtaken by the Red Army became satellite states of the Eastern Bloc.', u'The Cold War emerged by 1947 as the Soviet bloc confronted the Western states that united in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1949.', u'Following Stalin\'s death in 1953, a period of political and economic liberalization, known as "de-Stalinization" and "Khrushchev\'s Thaw", occurred under the leadership of Nikita Khrushchev.', u'The country developed rapidly, as millions of peasants were moved into industrialized cities.', u'The USSR took an early lead in the Space Race with the first ever satellite and the first human spaceflight.', u'In the 1970s, there was a brief d\xe9tente of relations with the United States, but tensions resumed when the Soviet Union deployed troops in Afghanistan in 1979.', u'The war drained economic resources and was matched by an escalation of American military aid to Mujahideen fighters.', u'In the mid-1980s, the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, sought to further reform and liberalize the economy through his policies of glasnost and perestroika.', u'The goal was to preserve the Communist Party while reversing economic stagnation.', u'The Cold War ended during his tenure, and in 1989 Soviet satellite countries in Eastern Europe overthrew their respective communist regimes.', u'This led to the rise of strong nationalist and separatist movements inside the USSR as well.', u'Central authorities initiated a referendum\u2014boycotted by the Baltic republics, Armenia, Georgia, and Moldova\u2014which resulted in the majority of participating citizens voting in favor of preserving the Union as a renewed federation.', u"In August 1991, a coup d'\xe9tat was attempted by Communist Party hardliners.", u'It failed, with Russian President Boris Yeltsin playing a high-profile role in facing down the coup, resulting in the banning of the Communist Party.', u'On 25 December 1991, Gorbachev resigned and the remaining twelve constituent republics emerged from the dissolution of the Soviet Union as independent post-Soviet states.', u"The Russian Federation (formerly the Russian SFSR) assumed the Soviet Union's rights and obligations and has emerged as the recognized primary legal successor of the Soviet Union.", u'== Name ==\n\nThe word \u201cSoviet\u201d is derived from a Russian word meaning council, assembly, advice, harmony, concord, and all ultimately deriving from the Proto-Slavic verbal stem of *v\u011bt-iti "to inform", related to Slavic "v\u011bst" ("news"), English "wise", the root in "ad-vis-or" (which came to English through French), or the Dutch "weten" (to know; cf.', u'"wetenschap" = science).', u'The word "sovietnik" means councillor.', u'A number of organizations in Russian history were called "council" (Russian: \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0301\u0442).', u'For example, in the Russian Empire, the State Council, which functioned from 1810 to 1917, was referred to as a Council of Ministers after the revolt of 1905.', u'From the beginning, the Soviet Union was the called the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics from its founding, although all the republics began as Socialist Soviet and did not change to the other order until 1936.', u'In addition, in the national languages of several republics the word "Council/Conciliar" in the respective language was only quite late changed to an adaptation of the Russian "Soviet" - and never in others, e.g., Ukraine.', u'The names of the Soviet Union are as

"Russia" as well in some encyclopedic sources.', u"== Geography, climate and environment ==\n\nWith an area of 22,402,200 square kilometres (8,649,500 sq mi), the Soviet Union was the world's largest country, a status that is retained by the Russian Federation.", u"Covering a sixth of Earth's land surface, its size was comparable to that of North America.", u"The European portion accounted for a quarter of the country's area, and was the cultural and economic center.", u'The eastern part in Asia extended to the Pacific Ocean to the east and Afghanistan to the south, and, except some areas in Central Asia, was much less populous.', u'It spanned over 10,000 kilometres (6,200 mi) east to west across 11 time zones, and over 7,200 kilometres (4,500 mi) north to south.', u'It had five climate zones: tundra, taiga, steppes, desert, and mountains.', u"The Soviet Union had the world's longest border, like Russia, measuring over 60,000 kilometres (37,000 mi), or \u200a1 1\u20442 circumferences of Earth.", u'Two-thirds of it was a coastline.', u'Across the Bering Strait was the United States.', u'The Soviet Union bordered Afghanistan, China, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Hungary, Iran, Mongolia, North Korea, Norway, Poland, Romania, and Turkey from 1945 to 1991.', u"The Soviet Union's highest mountain was Communism Peak (now Ismoil Somoni Peak) in Tajikistan, at 7,495 metres (24,590 ft).", u"The Soviet Union also included most of the world's largest lake, the Caspian Sea (shared with Iran), and Lake Baikal, the world's largest freshwater and deepest lake, an internal body of water in Russia.", u'== History ==\n\nThe last Russian Tsar, Nicholas II, ruled the Russian Empire until his abdication in March 1917 in the aftermath of the February Revolution, due in part to the strain of fighting in World War I, which lacked public support.', u'A short-lived Russian Provisional Government took power, to be overthrown in the October Revolution (N.S.', u'7 November 1917) by revolutionaries led by the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin.', u'The Soviet Union was officially established in December 1922 with the union of the Russian, Ukrainian, Byelorussian, and Transcaucasian Soviet republics, each ruled by local Bolshevik parties.', u'Despite the foundation of the Soviet state as a federative entity of many constituent republics, each with its own political and administrative entities, the term "Soviet Russia" \u2013 strictly applicable only to the Russian Federative Socialist Republic \u2013 was often applied to the entire country by non-Soviet writers and politicians.', u'=== Revolution and foundation ===\n\nModern revolutionary activity in the Russian Empire began with the Decembrist revolt of 1825.', u'Although serfdom was abolished in 1861, it was done on terms unfavorable to the peasants and served to encourage revolutionaries.', u'A parliament\u2014the State Duma\u2014was established in 1906 after the Russian Revolution of 1905, but Tsar Nicholas II resisted attempts to move from absolute to constitutional monarchy.', u'Social unrest continued and was aggravated during World War I by military defeat and food shortages in major Soviet cities.', u"A spontaneous popular uprising in Petrograd, in response to the wartime decay of Russia's economy and morale, culminated in the February Revolution and the toppling of the imperial government in March 1917.", u'The tsarist autocracy was replaced by the Russian Provisional Government, which intended to conduct elections to the Russian Constituent Assembly and to continue fighting on the side of the Entente in World War I.', u'At the same time, workers\' councils, known in Russian as "Soviets", sprang up across the country.', u'The Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, pushed for socialist revolution in the Soviets and on the streets.', u'On 7 November 1917, the Red Guards stormed the Winter Palace in Petrograd, ending the rule of the Provisional Government and leaving all political power to the Soviets.', u'This event would later be known as the Great October Socialist Revolution.', u'In December, the Bolsheviks signed an armistice with the Central Powers, though by February 1918, fighting had resumed.', u'In March, the Soviets ended involvement in the war for good and signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.', u"A long and bloody Civil War ensued between the Reds and the Whites, starting in 1917 and ending in 1923 with the Reds' victory.", u'It included foreign intervention, the execution of the former tsar and his family, and the famine of 1921, which killed about five million people.', u'In March 1921, during a related conflict with Poland, the Peace of Riga was signed, splitting disputed territories in Belarus and Ukraine between the Republic of Poland and Soviet Russia.', u'Soviet Russia had to resolve similar conflicts with the newly established Republic of Finland, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia, and the Republic of Lithuania.', u'=== Unification of republics ===\n\nOn 28 December 1922, a conference of plenipotentiary delegations from the Russian SFSR, the Transcaucasian SFSR, the Ukrainian SSR and the Byelorussian SSR approved the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR and the Declaration of the Creation of the USSR, forming the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.', u'These two documents were confirmed by the 1st Congress of Soviets of the USSR and signed by the heads of the delegations, Mikhail Kalinin, Mikhail Tskhakaya, Mikhail Frunze, Grigory Petrovsky, and Alexander Chervyakov, on 30 December 1922.', u'The formal proclamation was made from the stage of the Bolshoi Theatre.', u'On 1 February 1924, the USSR was recognized by the British Empire.', u'The same year, a Soviet Constitution was approved, legitimizing the December 1922 union.', u'An intensive restructuring of the economy, industry and politics of the country began in the early days of Soviet power in 1917.', u'A large part of this was done according to the Bolshevik Initial Decrees, government documents signed by Vladimir Lenin.', u'One of the most prominent breakthroughs was the GOELRO plan, which envisioned a major restructuring of the Soviet economy based on total electrification of the country.', u'The plan was developed in 1920 and covered a 10 to 15-year period.', u'It included construction of a network of 30 regional power stations, including ten large hydroelectric power plants, and numerous electric-powered large industrial enterprises.', u'The plan became the prototype for subsequent Five-Year Plans and was fulfilled by 1931.', u'=== Stalin era ===\n\nFrom its creation, the government in the Soviet Union was based on the one-party rule of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks).', u'After the economic policy of "War communism" during the Russian Civil War, as a prelude to fully developing socialism in the country, the Soviet government permitted some private enterprise to coexist alongside nationalized industry in the 1920s and total food requisition in the countryside was replaced by a food tax.', u"The stated purpose of the one-party state was to ensure that capitalist exploitation would not return to the Soviet Union and that the principles of democratic centralism would be most effective in representing the people's will in a practical manner.", u"Debate over the future of the economy provided the background for a power struggle in the years after Lenin's death in 1924.", u'Initially, Lenin was to be replaced by a "troika" consisting of Grigory Zinoviev of the Ukrainian SSR, Lev Kamenev of the Russian SFSR, and Joseph Stalin of the Transcaucasian SFSR.', u'On 3 April 1922, Stalin was named the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.', u"Lenin had appointed Stalin the head of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate, which gave Stalin considerable power.", u'By gradually consolidating his influence and isolating and outmaneuvering his rivals within the party, Stalin became the undisputed leader of the Soviet Union and, by the end of the 1920s, established totalitarian rule.', u'In October 1927, Grigory Zinoviev and Leon Trotsky were expelled from the Central Committee and forced into exile.', u'In 1928, Stalin introduced the First Five-Year Plan for building a socialist economy.', u'In place of the internationalism expressed by Lenin throughout the Revolution, it aimed to build Socialism in One Country.', u'In industry, the state assumed control over all existing enterprises and undertook an intensive program of industrialization.', u'In agriculture, rather than adhering to the "lead by example" policy advocated by Lenin, forced collectivization of farms was implemented all over the country.', u'Famines ensued, causing millions of deaths; surviving kulaks were persecuted and many sent to Gulags to do forced labour.', u'Social upheaval continued in the mid-1930s.', u'Stalin\'s Great Purge resulted in the execution or detainment of many "Old Bolsheviks" who had participated in the October Revolution with Lenin.', u'According to declassified Soviet archives, in 1937 and 1938, the NKVD arrested more than one and a half million people, of whom 681,692 were shot.', u'Over those two years that averages to over one thousand executions a day.', u'According to historian Geoffrey Hosking, "...excess deaths during the 1930s as a whole were in the range of 10\u201311 million."', u'Yet despite the turmoil of the mid-to-late 1930s, the Soviet Union developed a powerful industrial economy in the years before World War II.', u'==== 1930s ====\n\nThe early 1930s saw closer cooperation between the West and the USSR.', u'From 1932 to 1934, the Soviet Union participated in the World Disarmament Conference.', u"In 1933, diplomatic relations between the United States and the USSR were established when in November, the newly elected President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt chose to formally recognize Stalin's Communist government and negotiated a new trade agreement between the two nations.", u'In September 1934, the Soviet Union joined the League of Nations.', u'After the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, the USSR actively supported the Republican forces against the Nationalists, who were supported by Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany.', u'In December 1936, Stalin unveiled a new Soviet Constitution.', u'The constitution was seen as a personal triumph for Stalin, who on this occasion was described by Pravda as a "genius of the new world, the wisest man of the epoch, the great leader of communism."', u'By contrast, Western historians and historians from former Soviet occupied countries have viewed the constitution as a meaningless propaganda document.', u'The late 1930s saw a shift towards the Axis powers.', u'In 1939, almost a year after the United Kingdom and France had concluded the Munich Agreement with Germany, the USSR dealt with the Nazis as well, both militarily and economically during extensive talks.', u'The two countries concluded the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact and the German\u2013Soviet Commercial Agreement in August 1939.', u'The nonaggression pact made possible Soviet occupation of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Bessarabia, northern Bukovina, and eastern Poland.', u'In late November of the same year, unable to coerce the Republic of Finland by diplomatic means into moving its border 25 kilometres (16 mi) back from Leningrad, Joseph Stalin ordered the invasion of Finland.', u'In the east, the Soviet military won several decisive victories during border clashes with the Empire of Japan in 1938 and 1939.', u'However, in April 1941, USSR signed the Soviet\u2013Japanese Neutrality Pact with the Empire of Japan, recognizing the territorial integrity of Manchukuo, a Japanese puppet state.', u'==== World War II ====\n\nAlthough it has been debated whether the Soviet Union intended to invade Germany once it was strong enough, Germany itself broke the treaty and invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, starting what was known in the USSR as the "Great Patriotic War".', u'The Red Army stopped the seemingly invincible German Army at the Battle of Moscow, aided by an unusually harsh winter.', u'The Battle of Stalingrad, which lasted from late 1942 to early 1943, dealt a severe blow to the Germans from which they never fully recovered and became a turning point in the war.', u'After Stalingrad, Soviet forces drove through Eastern Europe to Berlin before Germany surrendered in 1945.', u'The German Army suffered 80% of its military deaths in the Eastern Front.', u'The same year, the USSR, in fulfillment of its agreement with the Allies at the Yalta Conference, denounced the Soviet\u2013Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1945 and invaded Manchukuo and other Japan-controlled territories on 9 August 1945.', u'This conflict ended with a decisive Soviet victory, contributing to the unconditional surrender of Japan and the end of World War II.', u'The Soviet Union suffered greatly in the war, losing around 27 million people.', u'During the war, the Soviet Union together with the United States, the United Kingdom and China were considered as the Big Four of Allied powers in World War II  and later became the Four Policemen which was the foundation of the United Nations Security Council.', u'It emerged as a superpower in the post-war period.', u'Once denied diplomatic recognition by the Western world, the Soviet Union had official relations with practically every nation by the late 1940s.', u'A member of the United Nations at its foundation in 1945, the Soviet Union became one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, which gave it the right to veto any of its resolutions.', u"The Soviet Union maintained its status as one of the world's two superpowers for four decades through its hegemony in Eastern Europe, military strength, economic strength, aid to developing countries, and scientific research, especially in space technology and weaponry.", u'==== Cold War ====\n\nDuring the immediate postwar period, the Soviet Union rebuilt and expanded its economy, while maintaining its strictly centralized control.', u'It aided post-war reconstruction in the countries of Eastern Europe, while turning them into satellite states, binding them in a military alliance (the Warsaw Pact) in 1955, and an economic organization (The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance or Comecon) from 1949 to 1991, the latter a counterpart to the European Economic Community.', u'Later, the Comecon supplied aid to the eventually victorious Communist Party of China, and saw its influence grow elsewhere in the world.', u"Fearing its ambitions, the Soviet Union's wartime allies, the United Kingdom and the United States, became its enemies.", u'In the ensuing Cold War, the two sides clashed indirectly using mostly proxies.', u'=== Khrushchev era ===\n\nStalin died on 5 March 1953.', u'Without a mutually agreeable successor, the highest Communist Party officials initially opted to rule the Soviet Union jointly through a troika.', u'This did not last, however, and Nikita Khrushchev eventually won the power struggle by the mid-1950s.', u"He shortly aftwerward denounced Stalin's use of repression in 1956 and proceeded to ease Stalin's repressive controls over party and society.", u'This was known as de-Stalinization.', u'Because Moscow considered Eastern Europe to be a critically vital buffer zone for the forward defense of its western borders (in case of another major invasion such as the German invasion of 1940), the USSR sought to cement its control of the region by transforming the Eastern European countries into satellite states dependent upon and subservient to its leadership.', u'Soviet military force was used to suppress anti-Stalinist uprisings in Hungary and Poland in 1956.', u"In the late 1950s, a confrontation with China regarding the USSR's rapprochement with the West and what Mao Zedong perceived as Khrushchev's revisionism led to the Sino\u2013Soviet split.", u'This resulted in a break throughout the global Marxist\u2013Leninist movement, with the governments in Albania, Cambodia and Somalia choosing to ally with China in place of the USSR.', u'During this period of the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Soviet Union continued to realize scientific and technological exploits in the Space Race, rivaling the United States: launching the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1 in 1957; a living dog named Laika in 1957; the first human being, Yuri Gagarin in 1961; the first woman in space, Valentina Tereshkova in 1963; Alexey Leonov, the first person to walk in space in 1965; the first soft landing on the moon by spacecraft Luna 9 in 1966 and the first moon rovers, Lunokhod 1 and Lunokhod 2.', u'Khrushchev initiated "The Thaw", a complex shift in political, cultural and economic life in the Soviet Union.', u'This included some openness and contact with other nations and new social and economic policies with more emphasis on commodity goods, allowing living standards to rise dramatically while maintaining high levels of economic growth.', u'Censorship was relaxed as well.', u"Khrushchev's reforms in agriculture and administration, however, were generally unproductive.", u'In 1962, he precipitated a crisis with the United States over the Soviet deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba.', u'An agreement was made between the Soviet Union and the United States to remove enemy nuclear missiles from both Cuba and Turkey, concluding the crisis.', u'This event caused Khrushchev much embarrassment and loss of prestige, resulting in his removal from power in 1964.', u'=== Brezhnev era ===\n\nFollowing the ousting of Khrushchev, another period of collective leadership ensued, consisting of Leonid Brezhnev as General Secretary, Alexei Kosygin as Premier and Nikolai Podgorny as Chairman of the Presidium, lasting until Brezhnev established himself in the early 1970s as the preeminent Soviet leader.', u'In 1968, the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact allies invaded Czechoslovakia to halt the Prague Spring reforms.', u'In the aftermath, Brezhnev justified the invasion along with the earlier invasions of Eastern European states by introducing the Brezhnev Doctrine, which claimed the right of the Soviet Union to violate the sovereignty of any country that attempted to replace Marxism\u2013Leninism with capitalism.', u'Brezhnev presided over a period of d\xe9tente with the West that resulted in treaties on armament control (SALT I, SALT II, Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty) while at the same time building up Soviet military might.', u'In October 1977, the third Soviet Constitution was unanimously adopted.', u"The prevailing mood of the Soviet leadership at the time of Brezhnev's death in 1982 was one of aversion to change.", u'The long period of Brezhnev\'s rule had come to be dubbed one of "standstill", with an aging and ossified top political leadership.', u"=== Gorbachev era ===\n\nTwo developments dominated the decade that followed: the increasingly apparent crumbling of the Soviet Union's economic and political structures, and the patchwork attempts at reforms to reverse that process.", u"Kenneth S. Deffeyes argued in Beyond Oil that the Reagan administration encouraged Saudi Arabia to lower the price of oil to the point where the Soviets could not make a profit selling their oil, so that the USSR's hard currency reserves became depleted.", u"Brezhnev's next two successors, transitional figures with deep roots in his tradition, did not last long.", u'Yuri Andropov was 68 years old and Konstantin Chernenko 72 when they assumed power; both died in less than two years.', u'In an attempt to avoid a third short-lived leader, in 1985, the Soviets turned to the next generation and selected Mikhail Gorbachev.', u'Gorbachev made significant changes in the economy and party leadership, called perestroika.', u'His policy of glasnost freed public access to information after decades of heavy government censorship.', u'Gorbachev also moved to end the Cold War.', u'In 1988, the Soviet Union abandoned its nine-year war in Afghanistan and began to withdraw its forces.', u"In the late 1980s, he refused military support to the Soviet Union's former satellite states, which paved the way for Revolutions of 1989.", u'With the tearing down of the Berlin Wall and with East Germany and West Germany pursuing unification, the Iron Curtain came down.', u'In the late 1980s, the constituent republics of the Soviet Union started legal moves towards potentially declaring sovereignty over their territories, citing Article 72 of the USSR constitution, which stated that any constituent republic was free to secede.', u'On 7 April 1990, a law was passed allowing a republic to secede if more than two-thirds of its residents voted for it in a referendum.', u'Many held their first free elections in the Soviet era for their own national legislatures in 1990.', u'Many of these legislatures proceeded to produce legislation contradicting the Union laws in what was known as the "War of Laws".', u"In 1989, the Russian SFSR, which was then the largest constituent republic (with about half of the population) convened a newly elected Congress of People's Deputies.", u'Boris Yeltsin was elected its chairman.', u"On 12 June 1990, the Congress declared Russia's sovereignty over its territory and proceeded to pass laws that attempted to supersede some of the USSR's laws.", u'After a landslide victory of S\u0105j\u016bdis in Lithuania, that country declared its independence restored on 11 March 1990.', u'A referendum for the preservation of the USSR was held on 17 March 1991 in nine republics (the remainder having boycotted the vote), with the majority of the population in those nine republics voting for preservation of the Union.', u'The referendum gave Gorbachev a minor boost.', u'In the summer of 1991, the New Union Treaty, which would have turned the Soviet Union into a much looser Union, was agreed upon by eight republics.', u"The signing of the treaty, however, was interrupted by the August Coup\u2014an attempted coup d'\xe9tat by hardline members of the government and the KGB who sought to reverse Gorbachev's reforms and reassert the central government's control over the republics.", u"After the coup collapsed, Yeltsin was seen as a hero for his decisive actions, while Gorbachev's power was effectively ended.", u'The balance of power tipped significantly towards the republics.', u"In August 1991, Latvia and Estonia immediately declared the restoration of their full independence (following Lithuania's 1990 example).", u"Gorbachev resigned as general secretary in late August, and soon afterward the Party's activities were indefinitely suspended\u2014effectively ending its rule.", u'By the fall, Gorbachev could no longer influence events outside of Moscow, and he was being challenged even there by Yeltsin, who had been elected President of Russia in July 1991.', u'=== Dissolution ===\n\nThe remaining 12 republics continued discussing new, increasingly looser, models of the Union.', u'However, by December, all except Russia and Kazakhstan had formally declared independence.', u'During this time, Yeltsin took over what remained of the Soviet government, including the Moscow Kremlin.', u'The final blow was struck on 1 December, when Ukraine, the second most powerful republic, voted overwhelmingly for independence.', u"Ukraine's secession ended any realistic chance of the Soviet Union staying together even on a limited scale.", u'On 8 December 1991, the presidents of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus (formerly Byelorussia), signed the Belavezha Accords, which declared the Soviet Union dissolved and established the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in its place.', u'While doubts remained over the authority of the accords to do this, on 21 December 1991, the representatives of all Soviet republics except Georgia signed the Alma-Ata Protocol, which confirmed the accords.', u'On 25 December 1991, Gorbachev resigned as the President of the USSR, declaring the office extinct.', u'He turned the powers that had been vested in the presidency over to Yeltsin.', u'That night, the Soviet flag was lowered for the last time, and the Russian tricolor was raised in its place.', u'The following day, the Supreme Soviet, the highest governmental body of the Soviet Union, voted both itself and the Soviet Union out of existence.', u'This is generally recognized as marking the official, final dissolution of the Soviet Union as a functioning state.', u'The Soviet Army originally remained under overall CIS command, but was soon absorbed into the different military forces of the newly independent states.', u'The few remaining Soviet institutions that had not been taken over by Russia ceased to function by the end of 1991.', u'Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991, Russia was internationally recognized as its legal successor on the international stage.', u'To that end, Russia voluntarily accepted all Soviet foreign debt and claimed overseas Soviet properties as its own.', u'Under the 1992 Lisbon Protocol, Russia also agreed to receive all nuclear weapons remaining in the territory of other former Soviet republics.', u"Since then, the Russian Federation has assumed the Soviet Union's rights and obligations.", u'Ukraine has refused to recognize exclusive Russian claims to succession of the USSR and claimed such status for Ukraine as well, which was codified in Articles 7 and 8 of its 1991 law On Legal Succession of Ukraine.', u'Since its independence in 1991 Ukraine has continued to pursue claims against Russia in foreign courts, seeking to recover its share of the foreign property that was owned by the Soviet Union.', u'The dissolution of the Soviet Union was followed by a severe economic contraction and catastrophic fall in living standards in post-Soviet states including a rapid increase in poverty, crime, corruption, unemployment, homelessness, rates of disease, and income inequality, along with decreases in calorie intake, life expectancy, adult literacy, and income.', u'The economic shocks that accompanied wholesale privatization were associated with sharp increases in mortality.', u'Data shows Russia, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia saw a tripling of unemployment and a 42% increase in male death rates between 1991 and 1994.', u'In summing up the international ramifications of these events, Vladislav Zubok stated: "The collapse of the Soviet empire was an event of epochal geopolitical, military, ideological, and economic significance. "', u'=== Post-Soviet states ===\n\nThe analysis of the succession of states with respect to the 15 post-Soviet states is complex.', u'The Russian Federation is seen as the legal continuator state and is for most purposes the heir to the Soviet Union.', u'It retained ownership of all former Soviet embassy properties, as well as the old Soviet UN membership and permanent membership on the Security Council.', u'The Baltic states are not successor states to the Soviet Union; they are instead considered to have de jure continuity with their pre-World War II governments through the non-recognition of the original Soviet incorporation in 1940.', u'The other 11 post-Soviet states are considered newly-independent successor states to the Soviet Union.', u'There are additionally four states that claim independence from the other internationally recognized post-Soviet states, but possess limited international recognition: Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh, South Ossetia, and Transnistria.', u'The Chechen separatist movement of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria lacks any international recognition.', u'== Politics ==\n\nThere were three power hierarchies in the Soviet Union: the legislature represented by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the government represented by the Council of Ministers, and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), the only legal party and the ultimate policymaker in the country.', u'=== Communist Party ===\n\nAt the top of the Communist Party was the Central Committee, elected at Party Congresses and Conferences.', u'The Central Committee in turn voted for a Politburo (called the Presidium between 1952\u20131966), Secretariat and the General Secretary (First Secretary from 1953 to 1966), the de facto highest office in the USSR.', u'Depending on the degree of power consolidation, it was either the Politburo as a collective body or the General Secretary, who always was one of the Politburo members, that effectively led the party and the country (except for the period of the highly personalized authority of Stalin, exercised directly through his position in the Council of Ministers rather than the Politburo after 1941).', u'They were not controlled by the general party membership, as the key principle of the party organization was democratic centralism, demanding strict subordination to higher bodies, and elections went uncontested, endorsing the candidates proposed from above.', u'The Communist Party maintained its dominance over the state largely through its control over the system of appointments.', u'All senior government officials and most deputies of the Supreme Soviet were members of the CPSU.', u'Of the party heads themselves, Stalin in 1941\u20131953 and Khrushchev in 1958\u20131964 were Premiers.', u'Upon the forced retirement of Khrushchev, the party leader was prohibited from this kind of double membership, but the later General Secretaries for at least some part of their tenure occupied the largely ceremonial position of Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the nominal head of state.', u'The institutions at lower levels were overseen and at times supplanted by primary party organizations.', u'In practice, however, the degree of control the party was able to exercise over the state bureaucracy, particularly after the death of Stalin, was far from total, with the bureaucracy pursuing different interests that were at times in conflict with the party.', u'Nor was the party itself monolithic from top to bottom, although factions were officially banned.', u'=== Government ===\n\nThe Supreme Soviet (successor of the Congress of Soviets and Central Executive Committee) was nominally the highest state body for most of the Soviet history, at first acting as a rubber stamp institution, approving and implementing all decisions made by the party.', u'However, the powers and functions of the Supreme Soviet were extended in the late 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, including the creation of new state commissions and committees.', u'It gained additional powers relating to the approval of the Five-Year Plans and the Soviet government budget.', u"The Supreme Soviet elected a Presidium to wield its power between plenary sessions, ordinarily held twice a year, and appointed the Supreme Court, the Procurator General and the Council of Ministers (known before 1946 as the Council of People's Commissars), headed by the Chairman (Premier) and managing an enormous bureaucracy responsible for the administration of the economy and society.", u'State and party structures of the constituent republics largely emulated the structure of the central institutions, although the Russian SFSR, unlike the other constituent republics, for most of its history had no republican branch of the CPSU, being ruled directly by the union-wide party until 1990.', u'Local authorities were organized likewise into party committees, local Soviets and executive committees.', u'While the state system was nominally federal, the party was unitary.', u'The state security police (the KGB and its predecessor agencies) played an important role in Soviet politics.', u'It was instrumental in the Stalinist terror, but after the death of Stalin, the state security police was brought under strict party control.', u'Under Yuri Andropov, KGB chairman in 1967\u20131982 and General Secretary from 1982 to 1983, the KGB engaged in the suppression of political dissent and maintained an extensive network of informers, reasserting itself as a political actor to some extent independent of the party-state structure, culminating in the anti-corruption campaign targeting high party officials in the late 1970s and early 1980s.', u'=== Separation of power and reform ===\n\nThe Union constitutions, which were promulgated in 1918, 1924, 1936 and 1977, did not limit state power.', u'No formal separation of powers existed between the Party, Supreme Soviet and Council of Ministers that represented executive and legislative branches of the government.', u'The system was governed less by statute than by informal conventions, and no settled mechanism of leadership succession existed.', u"Bitter and at times deadly power struggles took place in the Politburo after the deaths of Lenin and Joseph Stalin, as well as after Khrushchev's dismissal, itself due to a decision by both the Politburo and the Central Committee.", u'All leaders of the Communist Party before Gorbachev died in office, except Georgy Malenkov and Khrushchev, both dismissed from the party leadership amid internal struggle within the party.', u'Between 1988 and 1990, facing considerable opposition, Mikhail Gorbachev enacted reforms shifting power away from the highest bodies of the party and making the Supreme Soviet less dependent on them.', u"The Congress of People's Deputies was established, the majority of whose members were directly elected in competitive elections held in March 1989.", u'The Congress now elected the Supreme Soviet, which became a full-time parliament, much stronger than before.', u'For the first time since the 1920s, it refused to rubber stamp proposals from the party and Council of Ministers.', u'In 1990, Gorbachev introduced and assumed the position of the President of the Soviet Union, concentrated power in his executive office, independent of the party, and subordinated the government, now renamed the Cabinet of Ministers of the USSR, to himself.', u'Tensions grew between the union-wide authorities under Gorbachev, reformists led in Russia by Boris Yeltsin and controlling the newly elected Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR, and Communist Party hardliners.', u'On 19\u201321 August 1991, a group of hardliners staged an abortive coup attempt.', u'Following the failed coup, the State Council of the Soviet Union became the highest organ of state power "in the period of transition".', u'Gorbachev resigned as General Secretary, only remaining President for the final months of the existence of the USSR.', u'=== Judicial system ===\n\nThe judiciary was not independent of the other branches of government.', u"The Supreme Court supervised the lower courts (People's Court) and applied the law as established by the Constitution or as interpreted by the Supreme Soviet.", u'The Constitutional Oversight Committee reviewed the constitutionality of laws and acts.', u'The Soviet Union used the inquisitorial system of Roman law, where the judge, procurator, and defense attorney collaborate to establish the truth.', u'== Administrative divisions ==\n\nConstitutionally, the USSR was a federation of constituent Union Republics, which were either unitary states, such as Ukraine or Byelorussia (SSRs), or federal states, such as Russia or Transcaucasia (SFSRs), all four being the founding republics who signed the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR in December 1922.', u"In 1924, during the national delimitation in Central Asia, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan were formed from parts of the Russia's Turkestan ASSR and two Soviet dependencies, the Khorezm and Bukharan SSRs.", u'In 1929, Tajikistan was split off from the Uzbekistan.', u'With the constitution of 1936, the Transcaucasian SFSR was dissolved, resulting in its constituent republics of Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan being elevated to Union Republics, while Kazakhstan and Kirghizia were split off from Russian SFSR, resulting in the same status.', u'In August 1940, Moldavia was formed from parts of the Ukraine and Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina.', u'Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania (SSRs) were also admitted into the union which was not recognized by most of the international community and was considered an illegal occupation.', u'Karelia was split off from Russia as a Union Republic in March 1940 and was reabsorbed in 1956.', u'Between July 1956 and September 1991, there were 15 union republics (see map below).', u'While nominally a union of equals, in practice the Soviet Union was dominated by the Russian SFSR\u2014to such an extent that for most of the Soviet Union\'s existence, it was commonly (but incorrectly) referred to as "Russia."', u'While the RSFSR was technically only one republic within the larger union, it was by far the largest (both in terms of population and geography), most powerful, and most highly developed.', u'Historian Matthew White wrote that it was an open secret that the Soviet Union\'s federal structure was "window dressing" for Russian dominance.', u'For that reason, the people of the Soviet Union were usually called "Russians," not "Soviets," since "everyone knew who really ran the show."', u'== Economy ==\n\nThe Soviet Union became the first country to adopt a planned economy, whereby production and distribution of goods were centralized and directed by the government.', u'The first Bolshevik experience with a command economy was the policy of War communism, which involved the nationalization of industry, centralized distribution of output, coercive requisition of agricultural production, and attempts to eliminate the circulation of money, as well as private enterprises and free trade.', u'After the severe economic collapse caused by the war, Lenin replaced War Communism with the New Economic Policy (NEP) in 1921, legalising free trade and private ownership of smaller businesses.', u'The economy quickly recovered.', u'Following a lengthy debate among the members of Politburo over the course of economic development, by 1928\u20131929, upon gaining control of the country, Joseph Stalin abandoned the NEP and pushed for full central planning, starting forced collectivization of agriculture and enacting draconian labor legislation.', u'Resources were mobilized for rapid industrialization, which greatly expanded Soviet capacity in heavy industry and capital goods during the 1930s.', u'Preparation for war was one of the main driving forces behind industrialization, mostly due to distrust of the outside capitalistic world.', u'As a result, the USSR was transformed from a largely agrarian economy into a great industrial power, leading the way for its emergence as a superpower after World War II.', u'During the war, the Soviet economy and infrastructure suffered massive devastation and required extensive reconstruction.', u'By the early 1940s, the Soviet economy had become relatively self-sufficient; for most of the period until the creation of Comecon, only a very small share of domestic products was traded internationally.', u'After the creation of the Eastern Bloc, external trade rose rapidly.', u'Still the influence of the world economy on the USSR was limited by fixed domestic prices and a state monopoly on foreign trade.', u'Grain and sophisticated consumer manufactures became major import articles from around the 1960s.', u'During the arms race of the Cold War, the Soviet economy was burdened by military expenditures, heavily lobbied for by a powerful bureaucracy dependent on the arms industry.', u'At the same time, the Soviet Union became the largest arms exporter to the Third World.', u'Significant amounts of Soviet resources during the Cold War were allocated in aid to the other socialist states.', u'From the 1930s until its dissolution in late 1991, the way the Soviet economy operated remained essentially unchanged.', u'The economy was formally directed by central planning, carried out by Gosplan and organized in five-year plans.', u'In practice, however, the plans were highly aggregated and provisional, subject to ad hoc intervention by superiors.', u'All key economic decisions were taken by the political leadership.', u'Allocated resources and plan targets were normally denominated in rubles rather than in physical goods.', u'Credit was discouraged, but widespread.', u'Final allocation of output was achieved through relatively decentralized, unplanned contracting.', u'Although in theory prices were legally set from above, in practice the actual prices were often negotiated, and informal horizontal links (between producer factories etc.)', u'were widespread.', u'A number of basic services were state-funded, such as education and healthcare.', u'In the manufacturing sector, heavy industry and defense were assigned higher priority than the production of consumer goods.', u'Consumer goods, particularly outside large cities, were often scarce, of poor quality and limited choice.', u'Under command economy, consumers had almost no influence over production, so the changing demands of a population with growing incomes could not be satisfied by supplies at rigidly fixed prices.', u'A massive unplanned second economy grew up alongside the planned one at low levels, providing some of the goods and services that the planners could not.', u'Legalization of some elements of the decentralized economy was attempted with the reform of 1965.', u'Although statistics of the Soviet economy are notoriously unreliable and its economic growth difficult to estimate precisely, by most accounts, the economy continued to expand until the mid-1980s.', u'During the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet economy experienced comparatively high growth and was catching up to the West.', u'However, after 1970, the growth, while still positive, steadily declined much more quickly and consistently than in other countries despite a rapid increase in the capital stock (the rate of increase in capital was only surpassed by Japan).', u'Overall, between 1960 and 1989, the growth rate of per capita income in the Soviet Union was slightly above the world average (based on 102 countries).', u'According to Stanley Fischer and William Easterly, growth could have been faster.', u'By their calculation, per capita income of Soviet Union in 1989 should have been twice as high as it was considering the amount of investment, education and population.', u'The authors attribute this poor performance to low productivity of capital in the Soviet Union.', u"Steven Rosenfielde states that the standard of living actually declined as a result of Stalin's despotism, and while there was a brief improvement following his death, lapsed into stagnation.", u'In 1987, Mikhail Gorbachev tried to reform and revitalize the economy with his program of perestroika.', u'His policies relaxed state control over enterprises, but did not yet allow it to be replaced by market incentives, ultimately resulting in a sharp decline in production output.', u'The economy, already suffering from reduced petroleum export revenues, started to collapse.', u'Prices were still fixed, and property was still largely state-owned until after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.', u'For most of the period after World War II up to its collapse, the Soviet economy was the second largest in the world by GDP (PPP), and was 3rd in the world during the middle of the 1980s to 1989, though in per capita terms the Soviet GDP was behind that of the First World countries.', u'When compared to countries who had a similar GDP per capita to the Soviet Union in 1928, the Soviets experienced significant growth.', u'In 1990, the Soviet Union had a Human Development Index of 0.920, placing them in the "high" category of human development.', u'They had the third highest in the Eastern Bloc, behind Czechoslovakia and East Germany, and the twenty-fifth highest in the world out of one hundred-thirty countries in total.', u'=== Energy ===\n\nThe need for fuel declined in the Soviet Union from the 1970s to the 1980s, both per ruble of gross social product and per ruble of industrial product.', u'At the start, this decline grew very rapidly but gradually slowed down between 1970 and 1975.', u'From 1975 and 1980, it grew even slower, only 2.6 percent.', u'David Wilson, a historian, believed that the gas industry would account for 40 percent of Soviet fuel production by the end of the century.', u"His theory did not come to fruition because of the USSR's collapse.", u'The USSR, in theory, would have continued to have an economic growth rate of 2\u20132.5 percent during the 1990s because of Soviet energy fields.', u"However, the energy sector faced many difficulties, among them the country's high military expenditure and hostile relations with the First World (pre-Gorbachev era).", u'In 1991, the Soviet Union had a pipeline network of 82,000 kilometres (51,000 mi) for crude oil and another 206,500 kilometres (128,300 mi) for natural gas.', u'Petroleum and petroleum-based products, natural gas, metals, wood, agricultural products, and a variety of manufactured goods, primarily machinery, arms and military equipment, were exported.', u'In the 1970s and 1980s, the Soviet Union heavily relied on fossil fuel exports to earn hard currency.', u'At its peak in 1988, it was the largest producer and second largest exporter of crude oil, surpassed only by Saudi Arabia.', u"=== Science and technology ===\n\nThe Soviet Union placed great emphasis on science and technology within its economy, however, the most remarkable Soviet successes in technology, such as producing the world's first space satellite, typically were the responsibility of the military.", u'Lenin believed that the USSR would never overtake the developed world if it remained as technologically backward as it was upon its founding.', u"Soviet authorities proved their commitment to Lenin's belief by developing massive networks, research and development organizations.", u'In the early 1960s, the Soviets awarded 40% of chemistry PhDs to women, compared to only 5% who received such a degree in the United States.', u"By 1989, Soviet scientists were among the world's best-trained specialists in several areas, such as energy physics, selected areas of medicine, mathematics, welding and military technologies.", u'Due to rigid state planning and bureaucracy, the Soviets remained far behind technologically in chemistry, biology, and computers when compared to the First World.', u'Project Socrates, under the Reagan administration, determined that the Soviet Union addressed the acquisition of science and technology in a manner that was radically different from what the US was using.', u'In the case of the US, economic prioritization was being used for indigenous research and development as the means to acquire science and technology in both the private and public sectors.', u'In contrast, the Soviet Union was offensively and defensively maneuvering in the acquisition and utilization of the worldwide technology, to increase the competitive advantage that they acquired from the technology, while preventing the US from acquiring a competitive advantage.', u"However, in addition, the Soviet Union's technology-based planning was executed in a centralized, government-centric manner that greatly hindered its flexibility.", u'It was this significant lack of flexibility that was exploited by the US to undermine the strength of the Soviet Union and thus foster its reform.', u"=== Transport ===\n\nTransport was a key component of the nation's economy.", u'The economic centralization of the late 1920s and 1930s led to the development of infrastructure on a massive scale, most notably the establishment of Aeroflot, an aviation enterprise.', u'The country had a wide variety of modes of transport by land, water and air.', u'However, due to bad maintenance, much of the road, water and Soviet civil aviation transport were outdated and technologically backward compared to the First World.', u'Soviet rail transport was the largest and most intensively used in the world; it was also better developed than most of its Western counterparts.', u'By the late 1970s and early 1980s, Soviet economists were calling for the construction of more roads to alleviate some of the burden from the railways and to improve the Soviet government budget.', u'The street network and automotive industry remained underdeveloped, and dirt roads were common outside major cities.', u'Soviet maintenance projects proved unable to take care of even the few roads the country had.', u'By the early-to-mid-1980s, the Soviet authorities tried to solve the road problem by ordering the construction of new ones.', u'Meanwhile, the automobile industry was growing at a faster rate than road construction.', u'The underdeveloped road network led to a growing demand for public transport.', u'Despite improvements, several aspects of the transport sector were still riddled with problems due to outdated infrastructure, lack of investment, corruption and bad decision-making.', u'Soviet authorities were unable to meet the growing demand for transport infrastructure and services.', u'The Soviet merchant navy was one of the largest in the world.', u'== Demographics ==\n\nExcess deaths over the course of World War I and the Russian Civil War (including the postwar famine) amounted to a combined total of 18 million, some 10 million in the 1930s, and more than 26 million in 1941\u20135.', u'The postwar Soviet population was 45 to 50 million smaller than it would have been if pre-war demographic growth had continued.', u'According to Catherine Merridale, "... reasonable estimate would place the total number of excess deaths for the whole period somewhere around 60 million."', u'The birth rate of the USSR decreased from 44.0 per thousand in 1926 to 18.0 in 1974, largely due to increasing urbanization and the rising average age of marriages.', u'The mortality rate demonstrated a gradual decrease as well \u2013 from 23.7 per thousand in 1926 to 8.7 in 1974.', u'In general, the birth rates of the southern republics in Transcaucasia and Central Asia were considerably higher than those in the northern parts of the Soviet Union, and in some cases even increased in the post\u2013World War II period, a phenomenon partly attributed to slower rates of urbanization and traditionally earlier marriages in the southern republics.', u'Soviet Europe moved towards sub-replacement fertility, while Soviet Central Asia continued to exhibit population growth well above replacement-level fertility.', u'The late 1960s and the 1970s witnessed a reversal of the declining trajectory of the rate of mortality in the USSR, and was especially notable among men of working age, but was also prevalent in Russia and other predominantly Slavic areas of the country.', u'An analysis of the official data from the late 1980s showed that after worsening in the late-1970s and the early 1980s, adult mortality began to improve again.', u'The infant mortality rate increased from 24.7 in 1970 to 27.9 in 1974.', u'Some researchers regarded the rise as largely real, a consequence of worsening health conditions and services.', u'The rises in both adult and infant mortality were not explained or defended by Soviet officials, and the Soviet government simply stopped publishing all mortality statistics for ten years.', u'Soviet demographers and health specialists remained silent about the mortality increases until the late-1980s, when the publication of mortality data resumed and researchers could delve into the real causes.', u'=== Education ===\n\nBefore 1917, education was not free in the Russian Empire and was therefore either inaccessible or barely accessible for many children from lower-class working and peasant families.', u'Estimates from 1917 recorded that 75\u201385 percent of the Russian population was illiterate.', u"Anatoly Lunacharsky became the first People's Commissar for Education of Soviet Russia.", u'At the beginning, the Soviet authorities placed great emphasis on the elimination of illiteracy.', u'People who were literate were automatically hired as teachers.', u'For a short period, quality was sacrificed for quantity.', u'By 1940, Joseph Stalin could announce that illiteracy had been eliminated.', u'Throughout the 1930s social mobility rose sharply, which has been attributed to Soviet reforms in education.', u"In the aftermath of the Great Patriotic War, the country's educational system expanded dramatically.", u'This expansion had a tremendous effect.', u'In the 1960s, nearly all Soviet children had access to education, the only exception being those living in remote areas.', u'Nikita Khrushchev tried to make education more accessible, making it clear to children that education was closely linked to the needs of society.', u'Education also became important in giving rise to the New Man.', u'Citizens directly entering the work force had the constitutional right to a job and to free vocational training.', u"The country's system of education was highly centralized and universally accessible to all citizens, with affirmative action for applicants from nations associated with cultural backwardness.", u'However, as part of the general antisemitic policy, an unofficial Jewish quota was applied in the leading institutions of higher education by subjecting Jewish applicants to harsher entrance examinations.', u'The Brezhnev era also introduced a rule that required all university applicants to present a reference from the local Komsomol party secretary.', u'According to statistics from 1986, the number of higher education students per the population of 10,000 was 181 for the USSR, compared to 517 for the U.S.\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nThe Soviet Union was a very ethnically diverse country, with more than 100 distinct ethnic groups.', u'The total population was estimated at 293 million in 1991.', u'According to a 1990 estimate, the majority were Russians (50.78%), followed by Ukrainians (15.45%) and Uzbeks (5.84%).', u'All citizens of the USSR had their own ethnic affiliation.', u"The ethnicity of a person was chosen at the age of sixteen by the child's parents.", u'If the parents did not agree, the child was automatically assigned the ethnicity of the father.', u'Partly due to Soviet policies, some of the smaller minority ethnic groups were considered part of larger ones, such as the Mingrelians of Georgia, who were classified with the linguistically related Georgians.', u'Some ethnic groups voluntarily assimilated, while others were brought in by force.', u'Russians, Belarusians, and Ukrainians shared close cultural ties, while other groups did not.', u'With multiple nationalities living in the same territory, ethnic antagonisms developed over the years.', u'=== Health ===\n\nIn 1917, before the revolution, health conditions were significantly behind those of developed countries.', u'As Lenin later noted, "Either the lice will defeat socialism, or socialism will defeat the lice".', u"The Soviet principle of health care was conceived by the People's Commissariat for Health in 1918.", u'Health care was to be controlled by the state and would be provided to its citizens free of charge, this at the time being a revolutionary concept.', u'Article 42 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution gave all citizens the right to health protection and free access to any health institutions in the USSR.', u'Before Leonid Brezhnev became General Secretary, the healthcare system of the Soviet Union was held in high esteem by many foreign specialists.', u"This changed however, from Brezhnev's accession and Mikhail Gorbachev's tenure as leader, the Soviet health care system was heavily criticized for many basic faults, such as the quality of service and the unevenness in its provision.", u"Minister of Health Yevgeniy Chazov, during the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, while highlighting such Soviet successes as having the most doctors and hospitals in the world, recognized the system's areas for improvement and felt that billions of Soviet rubles were squandered.", u'After the socialist revolution, the life expectancy for all age groups went up.', u'This statistic in itself was seen by some that the socialist system was superior to the capitalist system.', u'These improvements continued into the 1960s, when the life expectancy in the Soviet Union surpassed that of the United States.', u'It remained stable during most years, although in the 1970s, it went down slightly, possibly because of alcohol abuse.', u'At the same time, infant mortality began to rise.', u'After 1974, the government stopped publishing statistics on this.', u'This trend can be partly explained by the number of pregnancies rising drastically in the Asian part of the country where infant mortality was highest, while declining markedly in the more developed European part of the Soviet Union.', u'The USSR had several centers of excellence, such as the Fyodorov Eye Microsurgery Complex, founded in 1988 by Russian eye surgeon Svyatoslav Fyodorov.', u'=== Language ===\n\nThe Soviet government headed by Vladimir Lenin gave small language groups their own writing systems.', u'The development of these writing systems was very successful, even though some flaws were detected.', u'During the later days of the USSR, countries with the same multilingual situation implemented similar policies.', u'A serious problem when creating these writing systems was that the languages differed dialectally greatly from each other.', u'When a language had been given a writing system and appeared in a notable publication, that language would attain "official language" status.', u'There were many minority languages which never received their own writing system; therefore their speakers were forced to have a second language.', u"There are examples where the Soviet government retreated from this policy, most notable under Stalin's regime, where education was discontinued in languages which were not widespread enough.", u'These languages were then assimilated into another language, mostly Russian.', u'During the Great Patriotic War, some minority languages were banned, and their speakers accused of collaborating with the enemy.', u'As the most widely spoken of the Soviet Union\'s many languages, Russian de facto functioned as an official language, as the "language of interethnic communication" (Russian: \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a \u043c\u0435\u0436\u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f), but only assumed the de jure status as the official national language in 1990.', u'=== Religion ===\n\nThe religious made up a significant minority of the Soviet Union prior to break up.', u'In 1990, the religious makeup was 20% Russian Orthodox, 10% Muslim, 7% Protestant, Armenian Apostolic, Georgian Orthodox, and Roman Catholic, less than 1% Jewish and 60% atheist.', u"Christianity and Islam had the greatest number of adherents among the Soviet state's religious citizens.", u"Eastern Christianity predominated among Christians, with Russia's traditional Russian Orthodox Church being the Soviet Union's largest Christian denomination.", u"About 90 percent of the Soviet Union's Muslims were Sunnis, with Shias concentrated in Azerbaijan.", u'Smaller groups included Roman Catholics, Jews, Buddhists, and a variety of Protestant sects.', u'Religious influence had been strong in the Russian Empire.', u'The Russian Orthodox Church enjoyed a privileged status as the church of the monarchy and took part in carrying out official state functions.', u'The immediate period following the establishment of the Soviet state included a struggle against the Orthodox Church, which the revolutionaries considered an ally of the former ruling classes.', u'In Soviet law, the "freedom to hold religious services" was constitutionally guaranteed, although the ruling Communist Party regarded religion as incompatible with the Marxist spirit of scientific materialism.', u'In practice, the Soviet system subscribed to a narrow interpretation of this right, and in fact utilized a range of official measures to discourage religion and curb the activities of religious groups.', u'The 1918 Council of People\'s Commissars decree establishing the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) as a secular state also decreed that "the teaching of religion in all [places] where subjects of general instruction are taught, is forbidden.', u'Citizens may teach and may be taught religion privately."', u"Among further restrictions, those adopted in 1929, a half-decade into Stalin's rule, included express prohibitions on a range of church activities, including meetings for organized Bible study.", u'Both Christian and non-Christian establishments were shut down by the thousands in the 1920s and 1930s.', u'By 1940, as many as 90 percent of the churches, synagogues, and mosques that had been operating in 1917 were closed.', u'Convinced that religious anti-Sovietism had become a thing of the past with most Soviet Christians, and with the looming threat of war, the Stalin regime began shifting to a more moderate religion policy in the late 1930s.', u'Soviet religious establishments overwhelmingly rallied to support the war effort during the Soviet war with Nazi Germany.', u'Amid other accommodations to religious faith after Hitler attacked the Soviet Union, churches were reopened, Radio Moscow began broadcasting a religious hour, and a historic meeting between Stalin and Orthodox Church leader Patriarch Sergius of Moscow was held in 1943.', u'Stalin had the support of the majority of the religious people in the Soviet Union even through the late 1980s.', u'The general tendency of this period was an increase in religious activity among believers of all faiths.', u"The Soviet establishment under General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev's leadership clashed with the churches in 1958\u20131964, a period when atheism was emphasized in the educational curriculum, and numerous state publications promoted atheistic views.", u'During this period, the number of churches fell from 20,000 to 10,000 from 1959 to 1965, and the number of synagogues dropped from 500 to 97.', u'The number of working mosques also declined, falling from 1,500 to 500 within a decade.', u'Religious institutions remained monitored by the Soviet government, but churches, synagogues, temples, and mosques were all given more leeway in the Brezhnev era.', u'Official relations between the Orthodox Church and the Soviet government again warmed to the point that the Brezhnev government twice honored Orthodox Patriarch Alexy I with the Order of the Red Banner of Labour.', u'A poll conducted by Soviet authorities in 1982 recorded 20 percent of the Soviet population as "active religious believers."', u'=== Women ===\n\nSoviet efforts to expand social, political and economic opportunities for women constitute "the earliest and perhaps most far-reaching attempt ever undertaken to transform the status and role of women."', u"== Culture ==\n\nThe culture of the Soviet Union passed through several stages during the USSR's 69-year existence.", u'During the first eleven years following the Revolution (1918\u20131929), there was relative freedom and artists experimented with several different styles to find a distinctive Soviet style of art.', u'Lenin wanted art to be accessible to the Russian people.', u'On the other hand, hundreds of intellectuals, writers, and artists were exiled or executed, and their work banned, for example Nikolay Gumilyov (shot for alleged conspiring against the Bolshevik regime) and Yevgeny Zamyatin (banned).', u'The government encouraged a variety of trends.', u'In art and literature, numerous schools, some traditional and others radically experimental, proliferated.', u'Communist writers Maxim Gorky and Vladimir Mayakovsky were active during this time.', u"Film, as a means of influencing a largely illiterate society, received encouragement from the state; much of director Sergei Eisenstein's best work dates from this period.", u"Later, during Stalin's rule, Soviet culture was characterized by the rise and domination of the government-imposed style of socialist realism, with all other trends being severely repressed, with rare exceptions, for example Mikhail Bulgakov's works.", u'Many writers were imprisoned and killed.', u'Following the Khrushchev Thaw of the late 1950s and early 1960s, censorship was diminished.', u'During this time, a distinctive period of Soviet culture developed characterized by conformist public life and intense focus on personal life.', u'Greater experimentation in art forms were again permissible, with the result that more sophisticated and subtly critical work began to be produced.', u'The regime loosened its emphasis on socialist realism; thus, for instance, many protagonists of the novels of author Yury Trifonov concerned

{'sentences': [u'On boats and ships, keel can refer to either of two parts: a structural element that sometimes resembles a fin and protrudes below a boat along the central line, or a hydrodynamic element.', u'These parts overlap.', u'As the laying down of the keel is the initial step in construction of a ship, in British and American shipbuilding traditions the construction is dated from this event.', u"Only the ship's launching is considered more significant in its creation.", u'The word can also be used as a synecdoche to refer to a complete boat, such as a keelboat.', u'== Structural keels ==\n\nA structural keel is the bottom-most structural member around which the hull of a ship is built.', u'The keel runs along the centerline of the ship, from the bow to the stern.', u"The keel is often the first part of a ship's hull to be constructed, and laying the keel, or placing the keel in the cradle in which the ship will be built may mark the start time of its construction.", u'Large, modern ships are now often built in a series of pre-fabricated, complete hull sections rather than being built around a single keel, so shipbuilding process commences with cutting the first sheet of steel.', u'The most common type of keel is the "flat plate keel", and this is fitted in the majority of ocean-going ships and other vessels.', u'A form of keel found on smaller vessels is the "bar keel", which may be fitted in trawlers, tugs, and smaller ferries.', u'Where grounding is possible, this type of keel is suitable with its massive scantlings, but there is always a problem of the increased draft with no additional cargo capacity.', u'If a double bottom is fitted, the keel is almost inevitably of the flat plate type, bar keels often being associated with open floors, where the plate keel may also be fitted.', u'Duct keels are provided in the bottom of some vessels.', u'These run from the forward engine room bulkhead to the collision bulkhead and are utilized to carry the double bottom piping.', u'The piping is then accessible when cargo is loaded.', u'== Hydrodynamic keels ==\n\n\n=== Non-sailing keels ===\nThe keel surface on the bottom of the hull gives the ship greater directional control and stability.', u'In non-sailing hulls, the keel helps the hull to move forward, rather than slipping to the side.', u'In traditional boat building, this is provided by the structural keel, which projects from the bottom of the hull along most or all of its length.', u'In modern construction the bar keel or flat-plate keel performs the same function.', u'There are many types of fixed keels, including full keels, long keels, fin keels, winged keels, bulb keels, and bilge keels among other designs.', u'Deep draft ships will typically have a flat bottom and employ only bilge keels, both to aid directional control and to damp rolling motions\n\n\n=== Sailboat keels ===\nIn sailboats, keels use the forward motion of the boat to generate lift to counteract the leeward force of the wind.', u'The rudimentary purpose of the keel is to convert the sideways motion of the wind when it is abeam into forward motion.', u'A secondary purpose of the keel is to provide ballast.', u'Keels are different from centreboards and other types of foils in that keels are made of heavy materials to provide ballast to stabilize the boat.', u'Keels may be fixed, or non-movable, or they may retract to allow sailing in shallower waters.', u'Retracting keels may pivot (a swing keel) or slide upwards to retract, and are usually retracted with a winch due to the weight of the ballast.', u'Since the keel provides far more stability when lowered than when retracted (due to the greater moment arm involved), the amount of sail carried is generally reduced when sailing with the keel retracted.', u'Types of non-fixed keels include swing keels and canting keels.', u'Canting keels can be found on racing yachts, such as those competing in the Volvo Ocean Race.', u'They provide considerably more righting moment as the keel moves out to the windward-side of the boat while using less weight.', u'The horizontal distance from the weight to the pivot is increased, which generates a larger righting moment.', u'== Etymology ==\nThe word "keel" comes from Old English c\u0113ol, Old Norse kj\xf3ll, = "ship" or "keel".', u'It has the distinction of being regarded by some scholars as the very first word in the English language recorded in writing, having been recorded by Gildas in his 6th century Latin work De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae, under the spelling cyulae (he was referring to the three ships that the Saxons first arrived in).', u'Carina is the Latin word for "keel" and is the origin of the term careen (to clean a keel and the hull in general, often by rolling the ship on its side).', u'An example of this use is Careening Cove, a suburb of Sydney, Australia, where careening was carried out in early colonial days.', u'== See also ==\nCoin

{'sentences': [u'In baseball, a home run (abbreviated HR, also "homer", "dinger", "dong", "bomb", "blast", "goner" , "shot", or "four-bagger") is scored when the ball is hit in such a way that the batter is able to circle the bases and reach home safely in one play without any errors being committed by the defensive team in the process.', u'In modern baseball, the feat is typically achieved by hitting the ball over the outfield fence between the foul poles (or making contact with either foul pole) without first touching the ground, resulting in an automatic home run.', u'There is also the "inside-the-park" home run, increasingly rare in modern baseball, where the batter reaches home safely while the baseball is in play on the field.', u'When a home run is scored, the batter is also credited with a hit and a run scored, and an RBI for each runner that scores, including himself.', u'Likewise, the pitcher is recorded as having given up a hit, and a run for each runner that scores including the batter.', u'Homeruns are among the most popular aspects of baseball and, as a result, prolific home run hitters are usually the most popular among fans and consequently the highest paid by teams\u2014hence the old saying, variously attributed to slugger Ralph Kiner, or to a teammate talking about Kiner, "Home run hitters drive Cadillacs, and singles hitters drive Fords."', u'== Types of home runs ==\n\n\n=== Out of the park ===\n\nIn modern times a home run is most often scored when the ball is hit over the outfield wall between the foul poles (in fair territory) before it touches the ground (in flight), and without being caught or deflected back onto the field by a fielder.', u'A batted ball is also a home run if it touches either foul pole or its attached screen before touching the ground, as the foul poles are by definition in fair territory.', u'Furthermore, many major-league ballparks have ground rules stating that a batted ball striking specific architectural features while in flight is a home run due to their location beyond the outfield wall.', u'A batted ball that goes over the outfield wall after touching the ground is not a home run, but an automatic double for the batter (often colloqually called a "ground rule double").', u'A fielder is allowed to reach over the wall to attempt to catch the ball as long as his feet are on or over the field during the attempt.', u'If the fielder successfully catches the ball while it is in flight the batter is out, even if the ball has already passed the vertical plane of the wall.', u'However, since the fielder is not part of the field, a ball that bounces off a fielder and over the wall without touching the ground is still a home run.', u"A fielder may not deliberately throw his glove, cap, or any other equipment or apparel to stop or deflect a fair ball, and an umpire may award a home run to the batter if a fielder does so on a ball that, in the umpire's judgment, would have otherwise been a home run (this is rare in modern professional baseball).", u'A home run accomplished in any of the above manners is an automatic home run.', u'The ball is dead, even if it rebounds onto the field from striking a foul pole or an object beyond the outfield wall, and the batter and any preceding runners cannot be put out at any time while running the bases.', u"However, if one or more runners fail to touch a base or one runner passes another before reaching home plate, that runner or runners can be called out on appeal, though in the case of not touching a base a runner can go back and touch it if doing so won't cause them to be passed by another preceding runner and they have not yet touched the next base (or home plate in the case of missing third base).", u'This stipulation is in Approved Ruling (2) of Rule 7.10(b).', u'=== Inside-the-park home run ===\n\nAn inside-the-park home run occurs when a batter hits the ball into play and is able to circle the bases before the fielders can put him out.', u'Unlike with an outside-the-park home run, the batter-runner and all preceding runners are liable to be put out by the defensive team at any time while running the bases.', u'This can only happen if the ball does not leave the ballfield.', u'In the early days of baseball, outfields were relatively much more spacious, reducing the likelihood of an over-the-fence home run, while increasing the likelihood of an inside-the-park home run, as a ball getting past an outfielder had more distance that it could roll before a fielder could track it down.', u"With outfields much less spacious and more uniformly designed than in the game's early days, inside-the-park home runs are now a rarity.", u'They are usually the result of a ball being hit by a very fast runner, coupled with an outfielder either misjudging the flight of the ball (e.g., diving and missing) or the ball taking an unexpected bounce.', u'Either way, this sends the ball into open space in the outfield and thereby allows the batter-runner to circle the bases before the defensive team can put him out.', u'The speed of the runner is crucial as even triples are relatively rare in most modern ballparks.', u'If any defensive play on an inside-the-park home run is labeled an error by the official scorer, a home run is not scored; instead, it is scored as a single, double, or triple, and the batter-runner and any applicable preceding runners are said to have taken all additional bases on error.', u'All runs scored on such a play, however, still count.', u'An example of an unexpected bounce occurred during the 2007 Major League Baseball All-Star Game at AT&T Park in San Francisco on July 10, 2007.', u'Ichiro Suzuki of the American League team hit a fly ball off the right-center field wall, which caromed in the opposite direction from where National League right fielder Ken Griffey, Jr. was expecting it to go.', u'By the time the ball was relayed, Ichiro had already crossed the plate standing up.', u"This was the first inside-the-park home run in All-Star Game history, and led to Suzuki being named the game's Most Valuable Player.", u'== Number of runs batted in ==\nHome runs are often characterized by the number of runners on base at the time.', u'A home run hit with the bases empty is seldom called a "one-run homer", but rather a solo home run, solo homer, or "solo shot".', u'With one runner on base, two runs are scored (the baserunner and the batter) and thus the home run is often called a two-run homer or two-run shot.', u'Similarly, a home runs with two runners on base is a three-run homer or three-run shot.', u'The term "four-run homer" is seldom used; instead, it is nearly always called a "grand slam".', u"Hitting a grand slam is the best possible result for the batter's turn at bat and the worst possible result for the pitcher and his team.", u'=== Grand slam ===\n\nA grand slam occurs when the bases are "loaded" (that is, there are base runners standing at first, second, and third base) and the batter hits a home run.', u'According to The Dickson Baseball Dictionary, the term originated in the card game of contract bridge.', u'An inside-the-park grand slam is a grand slam that is also an inside-the-park home run, a home run without the ball leaving the field, and it is very rare, due to the relative rarity of loading the bases along with the significant rarity (nowadays) of inside-the-park home runs.', u'On July 25, 1956, Roberto Clemente became the only MLB player to have ever scored a walk-off inside-the-park grand slam in a 9\u20138 Pittsburgh Pirates win over the Chicago Cubs, at Forbes Field.', u'On April 23, 1999, Fernando Tat\xeds made history by hitting two grand slams in one inning, both against Chan Ho Park of the Los Angeles Dodgers.', u'With this feat, Tat\xeds also set a Major League record with 8 RBI in one inning.', u'On July 29, 2003 against the Texas Rangers, Bill Mueller of the Boston Red Sox became the only player in major league history to hit two grand slams in one game from opposite sides of the plate.', u'In fact, he hit three home runs in that game, and his two grand slams were in consecutive at-bats.', u"On August 25, 2011 the New York Yankees became the first team to hit three grand slams in one game vs the Oakland A's.", u'The Yankees eventually went on to win the game 22\u20139, after trailing 7\u20131.', u'== Specific situation home runs ==\nThese types of home runs are characterized by the specific game situation in which they occur, and can theoretically occur on either an outside-the-park or inside-the-park home run.', u'=== Walk-off home run ===\n\nA walk-off home run is a home run hit by the home team in the bottom of the ninth inning, any extra inning, or other scheduled final inning, which gives the home team the lead and thereby ends the game.', u'The term is attributed to Hall of Fame relief pitcher Dennis Eckersley, so named because after the run is scored, the losing team has to "walk off" the field.', u'Two World Series have ended via the "walk-off" home run.', u'The first was the 1960 World Series when Bill Mazeroski of the Pittsburgh Pirates hit a 9th inning solo home run in the 7th game of the series off New York Yankees pitcher Ralph Terry to give the Pirates the World Championship.', u'The second time was the 1993 World Series when Joe Carter of the Toronto Blue Jays hit a 9th inning 3-run home run off Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Mitch Williams in Game 6 of the series, to help the Toronto Blue Jays capture their second World Series Championship in a row.', u'Such a home run can also be called a "sudden death" or "sudden victory" home run.', u'That usage has lessened as "walk-off home run" has gained favor.', u'Along with Mazeroski\'s 1960 shot, the most famous walk-off or sudden-death homer would probably be the "Shot Heard \'Round the World" hit by Bobby Thomson to win the 1951 National League pennant for the New York Giants.', u"A walk-off home run over the fence is an exception to baseball's one-run rule.", u'Normally if the home team is tied or behind in the ninth or extra innings the game ends as soon as the home team scores enough runs to achieve a lead.', u'If the home team has two outs in the inning, and the game is tied, the game will officially end either the moment the batter successfully reaches 1st base or the moment the runner touches home plate\u2014whichever happens last.', u'However, this is superseded by the "ground rule", which provides automatic doubles (when a ball-in-play hits the ground first then leaves the playing field) and home runs (when a ball-in-play leaves the playing field without ever touching the ground).', u'In the latter case, all base runners including the batter are allowed to cross the plate.', u'=== Lead-off home run ===\nA lead-off home run is a home run hit by the first batter of a team, the leadoff hitter of the first inning of the game.', u'In MLB, Rickey Henderson holds the record with 81 lead-off home runs.', u'Craig Biggio holds the National League record with 53, second overall to Henderson.', u'In 1996, Brady Anderson set a Major League record by hitting a lead-off home run in four consecutive games.', u'=== Back-to-back ===\nWhen two consecutive batters each hit a home run, this is described as back-to-back home runs.', u'It is still considered back-to-back even if both batters hit their home runs off different pitchers.', u'A third batter hitting a home run is commonly referred to as back-to-back-to-back, the most recent occurrence on opening day, April 4, 2016 when Denard Span, Joe Panik and Buster Posey of the San Francisco Giants hit back-to-back-to-back home runs off Ariel Pena of the Milwaukee Brewers.', u'Four home runs in a row by consecutive batters has only occurred eight times in the history of Major League Baseball.', u'Following convention, this is called back-to-back-to-back-to-back.', u'The most recent occurrence was on August 11, 2010, when the Arizona Diamondbacks hit four in a row against the Milwaukee Brewers in Miller Park as Adam LaRoche, Miguel Montero, Mark Reynolds and Stephen Drew homered off pitcher Dave Bush.', u'Bush became the third pitcher to surrender back-to-back-to-back-to-back home runs, following Paul Foytack on July 31, 1963 and Chase Wright on April 22, 2007.', u'On August 14, 2008, the Chicago White Sox defeated the Kansas City Royals 9-2.', u'In this game, Jim Thome, Paul Konerko, Alexei Ram\xedrez, and Juan Uribe hit back-to-back-to-back-to-back home runs in that order.', u'Thome, Konerko, and Ramirez blasted their homers off of Joel Peralta, while Uribe did it off of Rob Tejeda.', u'The next batter, veteran backstop Toby Hall, tried aimlessly to hit the ball as far as possible, but his effort resulted in a strike out.', u'On April 22, 2007 the Boston Red Sox were trailing the New York Yankees 3\u20130 when Manny Ramirez, J. D. Drew, Mike Lowell and Jason Varitek hit back-to-back-to-back-to-back home runs to put them up 4\u20133.', u'They eventually went on to win the game 7\u20136 after a three-run home run by Mike Lowell in the bottom of the 7th inning.', u'On September 18, 2006 trailing 9\u20135 to the San Diego Padres in the 9th inning, Jeff Kent, J. D. Drew, Russell Martin, and Marlon Anderson of the Los Angeles Dodgers hit back-to-back-to-back-to-back home runs to tie the game.', u'After giving up a run in the top of the 10th, the Dodgers won the game in the bottom of the 10th, on a walk-off two run home run by Nomar Garciaparra.', u'J. D. Drew has been part of two different sets of back-to-back-to-back-to-back home runs.', u'In both occurrences, his homer was the second of the four.', u"On September 30, 1997, in the sixth inning of Game One of the American League Division Series between the New York Yankees and Cleveland Indians, Tim Raines, Derek Jeter and Paul O'Neill hit back-to-back-to-back home runs for the Yankees.", u"Raines' home run tied the game.", u'New York went on to win 8\u20136.', u'This was the first occurrence of three home runs in a row ever in postseason play.', u'The Boston Red Sox repeated the feat in Game Four of the 2007 American League Championship Series, also against the Indians.', u'Twice in MLB history have two brothers hit back-to-back home runs.', u'On April 23, 2013, brothers Melvin Upton, Jr. (formerly B.J.', u'Upton) and Justin Upton hit back-to-back home runs.', u'The first time was on September 15, 1938, when Lloyd Waner and Paul Waner performed the feat.', u'Simple back-to-back home runs are a relatively frequent occurrence.', u'If a pitcher gives up a homer, he might have his concentration broken and might alter his normal approach in an attempt to "make up for it" by striking out the next batter with some fastballs.', u'Sometimes the next batter will be expecting that and will capitalize on it.', u'A notable back-to-back home run of that type in World Series play involved "Babe Ruth\'s called shot" in 1932, which was accompanied by various Ruthian theatrics, yet the pitcher, Charlie Root, was allowed to stay in the game.', u'He delivered just one more pitch, which Lou Gehrig drilled out of the park for a back-to-back shot, after which Root was removed from the game.', u'In Game 3 of the 1976 NLCS, George Foster and Johnny Bench hit back-to-back homers in the last of the ninth off Ron Reed to tie the game.', u'The Series-winning run was scored later in the inning.', u'Another notable pair of back-to-back home runs occurred on September 14, 1990, when Ken Griffey, Sr. and Ken Griffey, Jr. hit back-to-back home runs, off Kirk McCaskill, the only father-and-son duo to do so in Major League history.', u'On May 2, 2002, Bret Boone and Mike Cameron of the Seattle Mariners hit back-to-back home runs off of starter Jon Rauch in the first inning of a game against the Chicago White Sox.', u'The Mariners batted around in the inning, and Boone and Cameron came up to bat against reliever Jim Parque with two outs, again hitting back-to-back home runs and becoming the only pair of teammates to hit back-to-back home runs twice in the same inning.', u'On June 19, 2012, Jos\xe9 Bautista and Colby Rasmus hit back-to-back home runs and back-to-back-to-back home runs with Edwin Encarnaci\xf3n for a lead change in each instance.', u'=== Consecutive home runs by one batter ===\nThe occurrence of individuals hitting home runs in consecutive at-bats is not unusual, but three or more is rare.', u'If a player hits three home runs in a game, it is termed a hat-trick (which is also used for a player getting three strikeouts in a game).', u'The record for consecutive home runs by a batter under any circumstances is 4.', u'Of the sixteen players (through 2012) who have hit 4 in one game, six have hit them consecutively.', u'Twenty-eight other batters have hit four consecutive across two games.', u'Bases on balls do not count as at-bats, and Ted Williams holds the record for consecutive home runs across the most games, 4 in four games played, during September 17\u201322, 1957, for the Red Sox.', u'Williams hit a pinch-hit homer on the 17th; walked as a pinch-hitter on the 18th; there was no game on the 19th; hit another pinch-homer on the 20th; homered and then was lifted for a pinch-runner after at least one walk, on the 21st; and homered after at least one walk on the 22nd.', u'All in all, he had 4 walks interspersed among his 4 homers.', u'In World Series play, Reggie Jackson hit a record three in one Series game, the final game (Game 6) in 1977.', u'But those three were a part of a much more impressive feat.', u'He walked on four pitches in the second inning of game 6.', u'Then he hit his three home runs on the first pitch of his next three at bats, off of three different pitchers (4th inning- Hooten, 5th inning- Sosa, 8th inning- Hough).', u'He had also hit one in his last at bat of the previous game, giving him four home runs on four consecutive swings.', u'(His home run in game 5 was also hit on the first pitch, although this did not add to any significant streak.)', u'The four in a row set the record for consecutive homers across two Series games.', u'In Game 3 of the World Series in 2011, Albert Pujols hit three home runs to tie the record with Babe Ruth and Reggie Jackson.', u'The St. Louis Cardinals went on to win the World Series in Game 7 at Busch Stadium.', u'In Game 1 of the World Series in 2012, Pablo Sandoval of the San Francisco Giants hit three home runs on his first three at-bats of the Series, also tying the record with Pujols, Jackson, and Ruth.', u'Nomar Garciaparra holds the record for consecutive home runs in the shortest time in terms of innings: 3 homers in 2 innings, on July 23, 2002, for the Boston Red Sox.', u'=== Home run cycle ===\n\nAn offshoot of hitting for the cycle, a "home run cycle" is where a player hits a solo, 2-run, 3-run, and grand slam home run all in one game.', u'This is an extremely rare feat, as it requires the batter to not only hit four home runs in a game (which itself has only occurred 16 times in the Major Leagues), but also to hit those home runs with the specific number of runners already on base.', u"Although it is a rare accomplishment, it is largely dependent on circumstances outside the player's control, such as his preceding teammates' ability to get on base, as well as the order in which he comes to bat in any particular inning.", u'Another variant of the home run cycle would be the "natural home run cycle", which would require a batter to hit a solo, 2-run, 3-run, and grand slam home run in that order.', u'Though multiple home run cycles have been recorded in collegiate baseball, the only home run cycle in a professional baseball game belongs to Tyrone Horne, who stroked four long balls for the minor league, Double-A Arkansas Travelers in a game against the San Antonio Missions on July 27, 1998.', u'On May 20, 1998, the Triple-A Indianapolis Indians performed a feat possibly never before duplicated in professional baseball.', u'In the fifth inning of a game against the Pawtucket Red Sox, Indianapolis players hit for a "Homer Cycle".', u'Pete Rose, Jr. opened the inning with a solo home run, Jason Williams connected for a 3-run shot, Glenn Murray slugged a grand slam, and Guillermo Garcia finished the scoring with a 2-run blast.', u'The Indians won the game 11\u20134.', u'A major league player has come close to hitting for the home run cycle several times.', u'Recent examples include:\nApril 2, 1997, Tino Martinez of the New York Yankees, was a grand slam away from accomplishing this feat against his former team, the Seattle Mariners.', u'He hit a 3-run home run in the first inning, a 2-run home run in the third inning and a solo shot in the fifth inning; all off starting pitcher Scott Sanders.', u'April 26, 2005 Alex Rodriguez of the New York Yankees hit 3 home runs off Los Angeles Angels pitcher Bartolo Col\xf3n.', u'Rodriguez hit a 3-run home run, 2-run home run, and a grand slam in the first, third, and fourth innings, respectively.', u'May 16, 2008 Jayson Werth of the Philadelphia Phillies hit 3 home runs off Toronto Blue Jays pitchers David Purcey and Jesse Litsch.', u'Werth hit a 3-run home run, a grand slam, and a solo home run in the second, third, and fifth innings, respectively.', u'June 26, 2009, Andre Ethier of Los Angeles Dodgers hit a three-run home run off Jason Vargas in the second, a two-run home run off Roy Corcoran in the sixth, and a solo home run off Miguel Batista in the eighth inning in a game against Seattle Mariners.', u'July 7, 2009, Paul Konerko of the Chicago White Sox hit a solo home run in the second inning off Cleveland Indians pitcher Jeremy Sowers, a grand slam in the sixth inning off reliever Chris Perez, and a two-run home run in the seventh inning off reliever Winston

2015, Jarrett Parker of the San Francisco Giants hit three home runs against the Oakland Athletics: a solo home run in the second inning, a 2-run home run in the seventh inning, and a grand slam in the eighth inning.', u'== History of the home run ==\nIn the early days of the game, when the ball was less lively and the ballparks generally had very large outfields, most home runs were of the inside-the-park variety.', u'The first home run ever hit in the National League was by Ross Barnes of the Chicago White Stockings (now known as the Chicago Cubs), in 1876.', u'The home "run" was literally descriptive.', u'Home runs over the fence were rare, and only in ballparks where a fence was fairly close.', u'Hitters were discouraged from trying to hit home runs, with the conventional wisdom being that if they tried to do so they would simply fly out.', u"This was a serious concern in the 19th century, because in baseball's early days a ball caught after one bounce was still an out.", u'The emphasis was on place-hitting and what is now called "manufacturing runs" or "small ball".', u"The home run's place in baseball changed dramatically when the live-ball era began after World War I.", u'First, the materials and manufacturing processes improved significantly, making the now-mass-produced, cork-centered ball somewhat more lively.', u'Batters such as Babe Ruth and Rogers Hornsby took full advantage of rules changes that were instituted during the 1920s, particularly prohibition of the spitball, and the requirement that balls be replaced when worn or dirty.', u'These changes resulted in the baseball being easier to see and hit, and easier to hit out of the park.', u"Meanwhile, as the game's popularity boomed, more outfield seating was built, shrinking the size of the outfield and increasing the chances of a long fly ball resulting in a home run.", u'The teams with the sluggers, typified by the New York Yankees, became the championship teams, and other teams had to change their focus from the "inside game" to the "power game" in order to keep up.', u'Before 1931, a ball that bounced over an outfield fence during a major league game was considered a home run.', u'The rule was changed to require the ball to clear the fence on the fly, and balls that reached the seats on a bounce became ground rule doubles in most parks.', u'A carryover of the old rule is that if a player deflects a ball over the outfield fence without it touching the ground, it is a home run.', u'Also, until approximately that time, the ball had to not only go over the fence in fair territory, but to land in the bleachers in fair territory or to still be visibly fair when disappearing behind a wall.', u'The rule stipulated "fair when last seen" by the umpires.', u'Photos from that era in ballparks, such as the Polo Grounds and Yankee Stadium, show ropes strung from the foul poles to the back of the bleachers, or a second "foul pole" at the back of the bleachers, in a straight line with the foul line, as a visual aid for the umpire.', u'Ballparks still use a visual aid much like the ropes; a net or screen attached to the foul poles on the fair side has replaced ropes.', u'As with American football, where a touchdown once required a literal "touch down" of the ball in the end zone but now only requires the "breaking of the [vertical] plane" of the goal line, in baseball the ball need only "break the plane" of the fence in fair territory (unless the ball is caught by a player who is in play, in which case the batter is called out).', u"Babe Ruth's 60th home run in 1927 was somewhat controversial, because it landed barely in fair territory in the stands down the right field line.", u'Ruth lost a number of home runs in his career due to the when-last-seen rule.', u'Bill Jenkinson, in The Year Babe Ruth Hit 104 Home Runs, estimates that Ruth lost at least 50 and as many as 78 in his career due to this rule.', u'Further, the rules once stipulated that an over-the-fence home run in a sudden-victory situation would only count for as many bases as was necessary to "force" the winning run home.', u'For example, if a team trailed by two runs with the bases loaded, and the batter hit a fair ball over the fence, it only counted as a triple, because the runner immediately ahead of him had technically already scored the game-winning run.', u'That rule was changed in the 1920s as home runs became increasingly frequent and popular.', u"Babe Ruth's career total of 714 would have been one higher had that rule not been in effect in the early part of his career.", u'Major League Baseball keeps running totals of all-time home runs by team, including teams no longer active (prior to 1900) as well as by individual players.', u'Gary Sheffield hit the 250,000th home run in MLB history with a grand slam on September 8, 2008.', u"Sheffield had hit MLB's 249,999th home run against Gio Gonzalez in his previous at-bat.", u'The all-time, verified professional baseball record for career home runs for one player, excluding the U. S.

League, then the only major league in baseball.', u'Johnson changed the name of the league to the American League, leading teams in his league to be christened with the unofficial nickname "Americans".', u'This was especially true in the case of the new Boston franchise, which would not adopt an official nickname until 1908.', u'The upstart league placed franchises in Baltimore, Maryland and Buffalo.', u"After looking at his new league, Ban Johnson decided that he would need a team in Boston to compete with the National League team there, and so cancelled the Buffalo club's franchise, offering one to a new club in Boston.", u'The Boston franchise was purchased in 1903 by Milwaukee publisher, George Brumder who sold the team one year later.', u'Playing their home games at Huntington Avenue Grounds, the Boston franchise finished second and third before capturing their first pennant in 1903 and repeating the next year.', u"Those teams were led by manager and star third

u'The Pirates were heavily favored as they had won the NL pennant by 6\xbd games.', u'Aided by the modified chants of "Tessie" by the Royal Rooters fan club and by its stronger pitching staff, the Americans managed to overcome the odds, and win the best-of-nine series five games to three.', u'The 1904 club was almost as good as the previous team, but due to the surprise emergence of the New York Highlanders, the Boston club found itself in a tight pennant race through the last games of the season.', u'A predecessor to what would become a storied rivalry, this race featured such controversial moves as the trade of Patsy Dougherty to the Highlanders for Bob Unglaub.', u"The climax of the season occurred on the last, dramatic doubleheader at the Highlanders' home stadium,

third in the top of the ninth, a spitball got away from Chesbro and Lou Criger scored the go-ahead run on one of the most famous wild pitches in history.", u'Unfortunately, the NL champion New York Giants declined to play any postseason series, fearing it would give their New York rivals credibility (they had expected the Highlanders to win), but a sharp public reaction led the two leagues immediately to make the World Series a permanent championship, starting in 1905.', u'These successful times soon ended, however, as Boston lost 100 games in 1906.', u'However, several new star players helped the newly renamed Red Sox improve almost immediately.', u'By 1909, legendary center fielder Tris Speaker had become a fixture in the Boston outfield, and the team worked their way to third place.', u'However, the Red Sox would not win the pennant again until their 105-win 1912 season, finishing with a club record .691 winning percentage.', u"Anchored by an outfield considered to be

in 1915 propelled the Red Sox to the 1915 World Series, where they beat the Philadelphia Phillies four games to one.', u'Following the 1915 season, Tris Speaker was traded to the Cleveland Indians.', u'His departure was more than compensated for, however, by the emergence of star pitcher Babe Ruth.', u'The Red Sox went on to win the 1916 World Series, this time defeating the Brooklyn Robins.', u'In 1918, Babe Ruth led his team to another World Series championship, this time over the Chicago Cubs.', u'=== Sale of Babe Ruth and Aftermath (1920\u201338) ===\n\nHarry Frazee bought the Red Sox from Joseph Lannin in 1916 for about $500,000.', u'A couple of notable trades involving Harry Frazee and the Yankees occurred before the Babe Ruth sale.', u'On December 18, 1918, outstanding outfielder Duffy Lewis, pitcher Dutch Leonard (who had posted a modern record 0.96 ERA in 1914), and pitcher Ernie Shore were traded to the Yankees for pitcher Ray Caldwell, Slim Love, Roxy Walters, Frank Gilhooley and $15,000.', u'As all three players were well regarded in Boston\u2014Lewis had been a key player on the 1910s championship teams, Shore had famously relieved Babe Ruth and retired 27 straight, and Leonard had only four years before setting a modern record for earned run average\u2014this trade was regarded as a poor one in Boston.', u'Then, on July 13, 1919, submarine-style pitching star Carl Mays was traded to the Yankees for Bob McGraw, Allan Russell and $40,000.', u'Mays would go on to have several good years for the Yankees, but had been a discipline problem for the Red Sox.', u'On December 26, 1919, Frazee sold Babe Ruth, who had played the previous six seasons for the Red Sox, to the rival New York Yankees (Ruth had just broken the single-season home run record, hitting 29 in 1919.)', u'Legend has it that Frazee did so in order to finance the Broadway play No, No, Nanette.', u'That play did not actually open on Broadway until 1925, but as Leigh Montville discovered during research for his book, The Big Bam: The Life and Times of Babe Ruth, No, No, Nanette had originated as a non-musical stage play called My Lady Friends, which opened on Broadway in December 1919.', u'My Lady Friends had, indeed, been financed by the Ruth sale to the Yankees.', u'During that period, the Red Sox, Yankees and Chicago White Sox had a d\xe9tente; they were called "Insurrectos" because their actions antagonized league president Ban Johnson.', u'Although Frazee owned the Boston Red Sox franchise, he did not own Fenway Park (it was owned by the Fenway Park Trust), making his ownership a precarious one; Johnson could move another team into the ballpark.', u'His club was in debt, but Frazee felt the need to purchase its playing site (which he did in 1920).', u'Further, providing the Yankees with a box office attraction would help that mediocre club, which had sided with him against Johnson and "the Loyal Five" clubs.', u'Finally, Ruth was considered a serious disciplinary problem, a reputation he amply confirmed while playing for the Yankees.', u'Frazee moved Ruth to stabilize Red Sox finances and cut distractions.', u'It was a straight sale, no players in return.', u'New York achieved great success after acquiring Ruth and several other very good players.', u'The sale of Babe Ruth came to be viewed as the beginning of the Yankees\u2013Red Sox rivalry, considered the "Greatest Rivalry on Earth" by American sports journalists.', u'After deciding to get out of baseball, Frazee began selling many of his star players.', u'In the winter of 1920, Wally Schang, Waite Hoyt, Harry Harper and Mike McNally were traded to the Yankees for Del Pratt, Muddy Ruel, John Costello, Hank Thormahlen, Sammy Vick and cash.', u'The following winter, iron man shortstop Everett Scott, and pitchers Bullet Joe Bush and Sad Sam Jones were traded to the Yankees for Roger Peckinpaugh (who would be immediately shipped to the Washington Senators), Jack Quinn, Rip Collins, Bill Piercy and $50,000.', u"On July 23, 1922, Joe Dugan and Elmer Smith were traded to the Yankees for Elmer Miller, Chick Fewster, Johnny Mitchell, and Lefty O'Doul, who was at the time a mediocre pitching prospect.", u'Acquiring Dugan helped the Yankees edge the St. Louis Browns in a tight pennant race, and the resulting uproar helped create a June 15 trading deadline that went into effect the next year.', u'Perhaps an even more outrageous deal was the trade of Herb Pennock, occurring in early 1923.', u'Pennock was traded by the Red Sox to the Yankees for Camp Skinner, Norm McMillan, George Murray and $50,000.', u'The loss of so much talent sent the Red Sox into free fall, even with the money Frazee earned from the trades.', u'During the 1920s and early 1930s, they were fixtures in the second division, never finishing closer than 20 games out of first.', u'The losses only mounted when Frazee sold the team to Bob Quinn in 1923.', u'During an eight-year period from 1925 to 1932, the Red Sox averaged over 100 losses per season, bottoming out in 1932 with a record of 43-111, still the worst record in franchise history.', u'One of the few bright spots on these teams was Earl Webb, who set the all-time mark for most doubles in a season in 1931 with 67.', u"The BoSox' fortunes began to change in 1933 when Tom Yawkey bought the team.", u'Yawkey acquired pitcher Wes Ferrell and one of the greatest pitchers of all-time, Lefty Grove, making his team competitive once again in the late thirties.', u'He also acquired Joe Cronin, an outstanding shortstop and manager and slugging first baseman Jimmie Foxx whose 50 home runs in 1938 would stand as a club record for 68 years.', u'Foxx also drove in a club record 175 runs.', u'=== 1939\u20131960: Williams Era ===\nIn 1939, the Red Sox purchased the contract of outfielder Ted Williams from the minor league San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League, ushering in an era of the team sometimes called the "Ted Sox."', u'Williams consistently hit for both high power and high average, and is generally considered one of the greatest hitters of all time.', u'The right-field bullpens in Fenway were built in part for Williams\' left-handed swing, and are sometimes called "Williamsburg."', u'Before this addition, it was over 400 feet (120 m) to right field.', u'He served two stints in the United States Marine Corps as a pilot and saw active duty in both World War II and the Korean War, missing at least five full seasons of baseball.', u'His book The Science of Hitting is widely read by students of baseball.', u'He is currently the last player to hit over .400 for a full season, batting .406 in 1941.', u'Williams feuded with sports writers his whole career, calling them "The Knights of the Keyboard", and his relationship with the fans was often rocky as he was seen spitting towards the stands on more than one occasion.', u'With Williams, the Red Sox reached the 1946 World Series, but lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games in part because of the use of the "Williams Shift", a defensive tactic in which the shortstop would move to the right side of the infield to make it harder for the left-handed-hitting Williams to hit to that side of the field.', u'Some have claimed that he was too proud to hit to the other side of the field, not wanting to let the Cardinals take away his game.', u'His performance may have also been affected by a pitch he took in the elbow in an exhibition game a few days earlier.', u'Either way, in his only World Series, Williams gathered just five singles in 25 at-bats for a .200 average.', u'The Cardinals won the 1946 Series when Enos Slaughter scored the go-ahead run all the way from first base on a base hit to left field.', u'The throw from Leon Culberson was cut off by shortstop Johnny Pesky, who relayed the ball to the plate just a hair too late.', u'Some say Pesky hesitated or "held the ball" before he turned to throw the ball, but this has been disputed.', u'Along with Williams and Pesky, the Red Sox featured several other star players during the 1940s, including second baseman Bobby Doerr and center fielder Dom DiMaggio (the younger brother of Joe DiMaggio).', u'The Red Sox narrowly lost the AL pennant in 1948 and 1949.', u'In 1948, Boston finished in a tie with Cleveland, and their loss to Cleveland in a one-game playoff ended hopes of an all-Boston World Series.', u'Curiously, manager Joseph McCarthy chose journeyman Denny Galehouse to start the playoff game when the young lefty phenom Mel Parnell was available to pitch.', u'In 1949, the Red Sox were one game ahead of the New York Yankees, with the only two games left for both teams being against each other, and they lost both of those games.', u'The 1950s were viewed as a time of tribulation for the Red Sox.', u'After Williams returned from the Korean War in 1953, many of the best players from the late 1940s had retired or been traded.', u'The stark contrast in the team led critics to call the Red Sox\' daily lineup "Ted Williams and the Seven Dwarfs."', u'Jackie Robinson was even worked out by the team at Fenway Park, however it appeared that owner Tom Yawkey did not want an African American player on his team at that time.', u'Willie Mays also tried out for Boston and was highly praised by team scouts.', u'In 1955, Frank Malzone debuted at third base and Ted Williams hit .388 at the age of 38 in 1957, but there was little else for Boston fans to root for.', u'Williams retired at the end of the 1960 season, famously hitting a home run in his final at-bat as memorialized in the John Updike story "Hub fans bid Kid adieu."', u'The Red Sox finally became the last Major League team to field an African American player when they promoted infielder Pumpsie Green from their AAA farm team in 1959.', u'=== 1960s ===\n\nThe 1960s also started poorly for the Red Sox, though 1961 saw the debut of Carl "Yaz" Yastrzemski, Williams\' replacement in left field, who developed into one of the better hitters of a pitching-rich decade.', u'Red Sox fans know 1967 as the season of the "Impossible Dream."', u'The slogan refers to the hit song from the popular musical play "Man of La Mancha".', u'1967 saw one of the great pennant races in baseball history with four teams in the AL pennant race until almost the last game.', u'The BoSox had finished the 1966 season in ninth place, but they found new life with Yastrzemski as the team went to the 1967 World Series, only to lose the Series to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games.', u'Yastrzemski won the American League Triple Crown (the most recent player to accomplish such a feat until Miguel Cabrera did so in 2012), hitting .326 with 44 home runs and 121 RBIs.', u'He finished one vote short of a unanimous MVP selection, as a Minnesota sportswriter placed Twins center fielder C\xe9sar Tovar first on his ballot.', u'But the Red Sox lost the series\u2014again to the St. Louis Cardinals, in seven games.', u'Legendary pitcher Bob Gibson stymied the Red Sox winning three games.', u'An 18-year-old Bostonian rookie named Tony Conigliaro slugged 24 home runs in 1964.', u'"Tony C" became the youngest player in Major League Baseball to hit his 100th home run, a record that stands today.', u'He was struck just above the left cheek bone by a fastball thrown by Jack Hamilton of the California Angels on Friday, August 18, 1967 and sat out the entire next season with headaches and blurred vision.', u'Although he did have a productive season in 1970, he was never the same.', u'=== 1970s ===\n\nAlthough the Red Sox were competitive for much of the late 1960s and early 1970s, they never finished higher than second place in their division.', u'The closest they came to a divisional title was 1972, when they lost by a half-game to the Detroit Tigers.', u"The start of the season was delayed by a players' strike, and the Red Sox had lost one more game to the strike than the Tigers had.", u'Games lost to the strike were not made up.', u'The Red Sox went to Detroit with a half-game lead for the final series of the season, but lost the first two of those three and were eliminated from the pennant race.', u'==== 1975 ====\nThe Red Sox won the AL pennant in 1975.', u'The 1975 Red Sox were as colorful as they were talented, with Yastrzemski and rookie outfielders Jim Rice and Fred Lynn, veteran outfielder Dwight Evans, catcher Carlton Fisk, and pitchers Luis Tiant and eccentric junkballer Bill "The Spaceman" Lee.', u'Fred Lynn won both the American League Rookie of the Year award and the Most Valuable Player award, a feat which had never previously been accomplished, and was not duplicated until Ichiro Suzuki did it in 2001.', u"In the 1975 American League Championship Series, the Red Sox swept the Oakland A's.", u'In the 1975 World Series, they faced the heavily favored Cincinnati Reds, also known as The Big Red Machine.', u'Luis Tiant won games 1 and 4 of the World Series but after five games, the Red Sox trailed the series 3 games to 2.', u'Game 6 at Fenway Park is considered among the greatest games in postseason history.', u'Down 6\u20133 in the bottom of the eighth inning, Red Sox pinch hitter Bernie Carbo hit a three-run homer into the center field bleachers off Reds fireman Rawly Eastwick to tie the game.', u'In the top of the eleventh inning, right fielder Dwight Evans made a spectacular catch of a Joe Morgan line drive and doubled Ken Griffey at first base to preserve the tie.', u'In the bottom of the twelfth inning, Carlton Fisk hit a deep fly ball which sliced towards the left field foul pole above the Green Monster.', u'As the ball sailed into the night, Fisk waved his arms frantically towards fair territory, seemingly pleading with the ball not to go foul.', u'The ball complied, and bedlam ensued at Fenway as Fisk rounded the bases to win the game for the Red Sox 7\u20136.', u'The Red Sox lost game 7, 4\u20133 even though they had an early 3\u20130 lead.', u'Starting pitcher Bill Lee threw a slow looping curve which he called a "Leephus pitch" or "space ball" to Reds first baseman Tony P\xe9rez who hit the ball over the Green Monster and across the street.', u'The Reds scored the winning run in the 9th inning.', u'Carlton Fisk said famously about the 1975 World Series, "We won that thing 3 games to 4."', u'==== 1978 pennant race ====\nIn 1978, the Red Sox and the Yankees were involved in a tight pennant race.', u'The Yankees were \u200a14 1\u20442 games behind the Red Sox in July, and on September 10, after completing a 4-game sweep of the Red Sox (known as "The Boston Massacre"), the Yankees tied for the divisional lead.', u"On September 16 the Yankees held a \u200a3 1\u20442 game lead over the Red Sox, but the Sox won 11 of their next 13 games and by the final day of the season, the Yankees' magic number to win the division was one\u2014with a win over Cleveland or a Boston loss to the Toronto Blue Jays clinching the division.", u'However, New York lost 9\u20132 and Boston won 5\u20130, forcing a one-game playoff to be held at Fenway Park on Monday, October 2.', u"The most remembered moment from the game was Bucky Dent's 7th inning three-run home run in off Mike Torrez just over the Green Monster, giving the Yankees their first lead.", u'The dejected Boston manager, Don Zimmer, gave Mr. Dent a new middle name which lives on in Boston sports lore to this day, uttering three words as the ball sailed over the left-field wall: "Bucky F**king Dent!"', u"Reggie Jackson provided a solo home run in the 8th that proved to be the difference in the Yankees' 5\u20134 win, which ended with Yastrzemski popping out to Graig Nettles in foul territory with Rick Burleson representing the tying run at third.", u'Although Dent became a Red Sox demon, the Red Sox would get retribution in 1990 when the Yankees fired Dent as their manager during a series at Fenway Park.', u'=== 1980s ===\n\nCarl Yastrzemski retired after the 1983 season, during which the Red Sox finished sixth in the seven-team AL East, posting their worst record since 1966.', u"==== 1986 ====\n\nHowever, in 1986, it appeared that the team's fortunes were about to change.", u'The offense had remained strong with Jim Rice, Dwight Evans, Don Baylor and Wade Boggs.', u'Roger Clemens led the pitching staff, going 24\u20134 with a 2.48 ERA, and had a 20-strikeout game to win both the American League Cy Young and Most Valuable Player awards.', u'Clemens became the first starting pitcher to win both awards since Vida Blue in 1971.', u'Despite spending a month and a half on the disabled list in the middle of the season, left-hander Bruce Hurst went 13-8, striking out 167 and pitching four shutout games.', u'Boston sportswriters that season compared Clemens and Hurst to Don Drysdale and Sandy Koufax from the 1960s Los Angeles Dodgers.', u'The Red Sox won the AL East for the first time in 11 seasons, and faced the California Angels in the ALCS.', u'The teams split the first two games in Boston, but the Angels won the next two home games, taking a 3\u20131 lead in the series.', u'With the Angels poised to win the series, the Red Sox trailed 5\u20132 heading into the ninth inning of Game 5.', u'A two-run homer by Baylor cut the lead to one.', u'With two outs and a runner on, and one strike away from elimination, Dave Henderson homered off Donnie Moore to put Boston up 6\u20135.', u'Although the Angels tied the game in the bottom of the ninth, the Red Sox won in the 11th on a Henderson sacrifice fly off Moore.', u'The Red Sox then found themselves with six- and seven-run wins at Fenway Park in Games 6 and 7 to win the American League title.', u'The Red Sox faced a heavily favored New York Mets team that had won 108 games in the regular season in the 1986 World Series.', u'Boston won the first two games in Shea Stadium but lost the next two at Fenway, knotting the series at 2 games apiece.', u'After Bruce Hurst recorded his second victory of the series in Game 5, the Red Sox returned to Shea Stadium looking to garner their first championship in 68 years.', u'However, Game 6 would go down as one of the most devastating losses in club history.', u'After pitching seven strong innings, Clemens was lifted from the game with a 3\u20132 lead.', u'Years later, Manager John McNamara said Clemens was suffering from a blister and asked to be taken out of the game, a claim Clemens denied.', u'The Mets then scored a run off reliever and former Met Calvin Schiraldi to tie the score 3\u20133.', u'The game went to extra innings, where the Red Sox took a 5\u20133 lead in the top of the 10th on a solo home run by Henderson, a double by Boggs and an RBI single by second baseman Marty Barrett.', u'After recording two outs in the bottom of the 10th, a graphic appeared on the NBC telecast hailing Barrett as the Player of the Game and Bruce Hurst as World Series MVP.', u'A message even appeared briefly on the Shea Stadium scoreboard congratulating the Red Sox as world champions.', u'After so many years of abject frustration, Red Sox fans around the world could taste victory.', u'With the count at two balls and one strike, Mets catcher Gary Carter hit a single.', u'It was followed by singles by Kevin Mitchell and Ray Knight.', u'With Mookie Wilson batting, a wild pitch by Bob Stanley tied the game at 5.', u"Wilson then hit a slow ground ball to first; the ball rolled through Bill Buckner's legs, allowing Knight to score the winning run from second.", u'While Buckner was singled out as responsible for the loss, many observers\u2014as well as both Wilson and Buckner\u2014have noted that even if Buckner had fielded the ball cleanly, the speedy Wilson probably would still have been safe, leaving the game-winning run at third with two out.', u'Many observers questioned why Buckner was in the game at that point considering he had bad knees and that Dave Stapleton had come in as a late-inning defensive replacement in prior series games.', u'It appeared as though McNamara was trying to reward Buckner for his long and illustrious career by leaving him in the game.', u'After falling behind 3\u20130, the Mets then won Game 7, concluding the devastating collapse and feeding the myth that the Red Sox were "cursed."', u'This World Series loss had a strange twist: Red Sox General Manager Lou Gorman was vice-president, player personnel, of the Mets from 1980 to 1983.', u"Working under Mets' GM Frank Cashen, with whom Gorman served with the Orioles, he helped lay the foundation for the Mets' championship.", u'=== 1988\u20131991 ===\nThe Red Sox returned to the postseason in 1988.', u'With the club in fourth place midway through the 1988 season at the All-Star break, manager John McNamara was fired and replaced by Walpole, Massachusetts, resident and longtime minor-league manager Joe Morgan on July 15.', u'Immediately the club won 12 games in a row, and 19 of 20 overall, to surge to the AL East title in what would be referred to as Morgan Magic.', u'But the magic was short-lived, as the team was swept by the Oakland Athletics in the ALCS.', u'Ironically, the MVP of that Series was former Red Sox pitcher and Baseball Hall of Fame player Dennis Eckersley, who saved all four wins for Oakland.', u'Two years later, in 1990, the Red Sox would again win the division and face the Athletics in the ALCS.', u"However, the outcome was the same, with the A's sweeping the ALCS in four straight.", u'In 1990, Yankees fans started to chant "1918!"', u'to taunt the Red Sox.', u'The demeaning chant would echo at Yankee Stadium each time the Red Sox were there.', u"Also, Fenway Park became the scene of Bucky Dent's worst moment as a manager, although it was where he had his greatest triumph.", u'In June, when the Red Sox swept the Yankees during a four-game series at Fenway Park, the Yankees fired Dent as their manager.', u'Red Sox fans felt retribution to Dent being fired on their field, but the Yankees used him as a scapegoat.', u'However, Dan Shaughnessy of The Boston Globe severely criticized Yankees Owner George Steinbrenner for firing Dent\u2014his 18th managerial change in as many years since becoming owner\u2014in Boston and said he should "have waited until the Yankees got to Baltimore" to fire Dent.', u'He said that "if Dent had been fired in Seattle or Milwaukee, this would have been just another event in an endless line of George\'s jettisons.', u'But it happened in Boston and the nightly news had its hook."', u'"The firing was only special because ... it\'s the first time a Yankee manager\u2014who was also a Red Sox demon\u2014was purged on the ancient Indian burial grounds of the Back Bay."', u'=== 1992\u20132001 ===\n\nTom Yawkey died in 1976, and his wife Jean R. Yawkey took control of the team until her death in 1992.', u'Their initials are shown in two stripes on the left field wall in Morse code.', u"Upon Jean's death, control of the team passed to the Yawkey Trust, led by John Harrington.", u'The trust sold the team in 2002, concluding 70 years of Yawkey ownership.', u'In 1994, General Manager Lou Gorman was replaced by Dan Duquette, a Massachusetts native who had worked for the Montreal Expos.', u"Duquette revived the team's farm system, which during his tenure produced players such as Nomar Garciaparra, Carl Pavano and David Eckstein.", u'Duquette also spent money on free agents, notably an 8-year, $160 million deal for Manny Ram\xedrez after the 2000 season.', u'The Red Sox won the newly realigned American League East in 1995, finishing seven games ahead of the Yankees.', u'However, they were swept in three games in the ALDS by the Cleveland Indians.', u'Their postseason losing streak reached 13 straight games, dating back to the 1986 World Series.', u'Roger Clemens tied his major league record by fanning 20 Detroit Tigers on September 18, 1996 in what would prove to be one of his final appearances in a Red Sox uniform.', u'After Clemens had turned 30 and then had four seasons, 1993\u201396, which were by his standards mediocre at best, Duquette said the pitcher was entering "the twilight of his career".', u'Clemens went on to pitch well for another ten years and win four more Cy Young Awards.', u'Out of contention in 1997, the team traded closer Heathcliff Slocumb to Seattle for catching prospect Jason Varitek and right-handed pitcher Derek Lowe.', u'Prior to the start of the 1998 season, the Red Sox dealt pitchers Tony Armas, Jr. and Carl Pavano to the Montreal Expos for pitcher Pedro Mart\xednez.', u"Mart\xednez became the anchor of the team's pitching staff and turned in several outstanding seasons.", u'In 1998, the team won the American League Wild Card, but again lost the American League Division Series to the Indians.', u'In 1999, Duquette called Fenway Park "economically obsolete" and, along with Red Sox ownership, led a push for a new stadium.', u'On the field, the 1999 Red Sox were finally able to overturn their fortunes against the Indians.', u'Cleveland took a 2\u20130 series lead, but Boston won the next three games behind strong pitching by Derek Lowe, Pedro Mart\xednez and his brother Ram\xf3n Mart\xednez.', u"Game 4's 23\u20137 win by the Red Sox was the highest-scoring playoff game in major league history.", u"Game 5 began with the Indians taking a 5\u20132 lead after two innings, but Pedro Mart\xednez, nursing a shoulder injury, came on in the fourth inning and pitched six innings without allowing a hit while the team's offense rallied for a 12\u20138 win behind two home runs and seven RBIs from outfielder Troy O'Leary.", u'After the ALDS victory, the Red Sox lost the American League Championship Series to the Yankees, four games to one.', u'The one bright spot was a lopsided win for the Red Sox in the much-hyped Martinez-Clemens game.', u'=== 2002\u2013present: John Henry era ===\n\n\n==== 2002\u201303 ====\n\nIn 2002, the Red Sox were sold by Yawkey trustee and president Harrington to New England Sports Ventures, a consortium headed by principal owner John Henry.', u'Tom Werner served as executive chairman, Larry Lucchino served as president and CEO, and serving as vice chairman was Les Otten.', u'Dan Duquette was fired as GM of the club on February 28, with former Angels GM Mike Port taking the helm for the 2002 season.', u'A week later, manager Joe Kerrigan was fired and was replaced by Grady Little.', u'While nearly all offseason moves were made under Duquette, such as signing outfielder Johnny Damon away from the Oakland Athletics, the new ownership made additions such as outfielder Cliff Floyd and relief pitcher Alan Embree.', u'Nomar Garciaparra, Manny Ram\xedrez, and Floyd all hit well, while Pedro Mart\xednez put up his usual outstanding numbers.', u'Derek Lowe, newly converted into a starter, won 20 games\u2014becoming the first player to save 20 games and win 20 games in back-to-back seasons.', u'After failing to reach the playoffs, Port was replaced by Yale University graduate Theo Epstein.', u'Epstein, raised in Brookline, Massachusetts, and just 28 at the time of his hiring, became the youngest general manager in MLB history.', u'The 2003 team was known as the "Cowboy Up" team, a nickname derived from first baseman Kevin Millar\'s challenge to his teammates to show more determination.', u'In the 2003 American League Division Series, the Red Sox rallied from a 0\u20132 series deficit against the Athletics to win the best-of-five series.', u'Derek Lowe returned to his former relief pitching role to save Game 5, a 4\u20133 victory.', u'The team then faced the Yankees in the 2003 American League Championship Series.', u'In Game 7, Boston led 5\u20132 in the eighth inning, but Pedro Mart\xednez allowed three runs to tie the game.', u'The Red Sox could not score off Mariano Rivera over the last three innings and eventually lost the game 6\u20135 when Yankee third baseman Aaron Boone hit a solo home run off of Tim Wakefield.', u'Some placed the blame for the loss on manager Grady Little for failing to remove starting pitcher Mart\xednez in the 8th inning after some observers believe he began to show signs of tiring.', u"Others credited Little with the team's successful season and dramatic come-from-behind victory in the ALDS.", u"Nevertheless, Boston's management did not renew Little's contract, and hired former Philadelphia Phillies manager Terry Francona.", u'==== "The Idiots": 2004 World Series Championship ====\n\nDuring the 2003\u201304 offseason, the Red Sox acquired another ace pitcher, Curt Schilling, and a closer, Keith Foulke.', u'Due to some midseason struggles with injuries, management shook up the team at the July 31 trading deadline as part of a four-team trade.', u"The Red Sox traded the team's popular, yet oft-injured, shortstop Nomar Garciaparra and outfielder Matt Murton to the Chicago Cubs, and received first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz from the Minnesota Twins, and shortstop Orlando Cabrera from the Montreal Expos.", u'In a separate transaction, the Red Sox acquired center fielder Dave Roberts from the Los Angeles Dodgers.', u'Following the trades, the club won 22 out of 25 games and qualified for the playoffs as the AL Wild Card.', u'Players and fans affectionately referred to the players as "the Idiots", a term coined by Damon and Millar during the playoff push to describe the team\'s eclectic roster and devil-may-care attitude toward their supposed "curse."', u'Boston began the postseason by sweeping the AL West champion Anaheim Angels in the ALDS.', u"In the third game of the series, David Ortiz hit a walk-off two-run homer in the 10th inning to win the game and the series to advance to a rematch of the previous year's ALCS in the ALCS against the Yankees.", u'The ALCS started very poorly for the Red Sox, as they lost the first three games (including a crushing 19-8 home loss in game 3).', u'In Game 4, the Red Sox found themselves facing elimination, trailing 4\u20133 in the ninth with Mariano Rivera in to close for the Yankees.', u'After Rivera issued a walk to Millar, Roberts came on to pinch run and promptly stole second base.', u'He then scored on an RBI single by Bill Mueller, sending the game into extra innings.', u'The Red Sox went on to win the game on a two-run home run by Ortiz in the 12th inning, who also made the walk-off hit in the 14th inning of game 5.', u'The comeback continued with a victory from an injured Schilling in game 6.', u"Three sutures being used to stabilize the tendon in Schilling's right ankle bled throughout the game, famously making his sock appear bloody red.", u'The Red Sox completed their historic comeback in game 7 with a 10-3 defeat of the Yankees.', u'Ortiz, who had the game-winning RBIs in Games 4 and 5, was named ALCS Most Valuable Player.', u'The Red Sox joined the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs and 1975 New York Islanders as the only professional sports teams in history at the time to win a best-of-seven games series after being down three games to none.', u'The 2009\u201310 Philadelphia Flyers (against the Boston Bruins) and the 2013\u201314 Los Angeles Kings (against the San Jose Sharks) would also accomplish the feat.', u'The Red Sox swept the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2004 World Series.', u"The Red Sox never trailed throughout the series; Mark Bellhorn's hit a game-winning home run off Pesky's Pole in game 1, and Schilling pitched another bloodied-sock victory in game 2, followed by similarly masterful pitching performances by Martinez and Derek Lowe.", u"It was the Red Sox' first championship in 86 years.", u'Manny Ram\xedrez was named World Series MVP.', u"To add a final, surreal touch to Boston's championship season, on the night of Game 4 a total lunar eclipse colored the moon red over Busch Stadium.", u'The Red Sox earned many accolades from the sports media and throughout the nation for their incredible season, such as in December, when Sports Illustrated named the Boston Red Sox the 2004 Sportsmen of the Year.', u'==== 2005\u201306 ====\n\nThe 2005 AL East would be decided on the last weekend of the season, with the Yankees coming to Fenway Park with a one-game lead in the standings.', u'The Red Sox won two of the three games to finish the season with the same record as the Yankees, 95\u201367.', u'However, a playoff was not needed, as the loser of such a playoff would still make the playoffs as a Wild Card team.', u'As the Yankees had won the season series, they were awarded the division title, and the Red Sox competed in the playoffs as the Wild Card.', u'Boston failed to defend their championship, and was swept in three games by the eventual 2005 World Series champion Chicago White Sox in the first round of the playoffs.', u'After the season, general manager Theo Epstein resigned rather than accept a contract extension.', u'In November 2005, the Red Sox announced the acquisition of pitcher Josh Beckett and third baseman Mike Lowell from the Florida Marlins, while sending several prospects including Hanley Ram\xedrez to the Marlins.', u'Fan-favorite Johnny Damon signed a 4-year, $52 million deal with the rival Yankees, whom he had earlier vowed never to play for.', u'The team filled the vacancy in center field by trading for Cleveland Indians center fielder Coco Crisp.', u'However, Crisp fractured his left index finger in April and would end up missing over 50 games in 2006.', u'Meanwhile, in January 2006, Epstein came to terms with the Red Sox and was once again named General Manager.', u"The revamped Red Sox infield, with third baseman Lowell joining new shortstop \xc1lex Gonz\xe1lez, second baseman Mark Loretta, and first baseman Kevin Youkilis (formerly the team's third baseman) was one of the best-fielding infields in baseball.", u'The Red Sox committed the fewest errors in the American League in 2006, and set a major league record of 17 consecutive errorless games.', u'One of the brightest spots of the 2006 season was the emergence of new closer Jonathan Papelbon, who became the first Red Sox rookie to be credited with 35 saves, earning an All-Star appearance.', u"Also, David Ortiz broke Jimmie Foxx's single season Red Sox home run record by hitting 54 homers.", u'However, Boston failed to make the playoffs after compiling a 9\u201321 record in the month of August due to injuries to catcher Jason Varitek, outfielder Trot Nixon, outfielder Manny Ram\xedrez, pitcher Tim Wakefield, rookie pitcher Jon Lester (who was diagnosed with lymphoma), and pitcher Matt Clement.', u"==== 2007: World Series Championship ====\n\nTheo Epstein's first step toward restocking the team for 2007 was to pursue one of the most anticipated acquisitions in baseball history.", u'On November 14, MLB announced that Boston had won the bid for the rights to negotiate a contract with Japanese Nippon Professional Baseball superstar pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka.', u'Boston placed a bid of $51.1 million to negotiate with Matsuzaka and completed a 6-year, $52 million contract after they were announced as the winning bid.', u'The Red Sox moved into first place in the AL East by mid-April and never relinquished their division lead.', u'Initially, rookie second baseman Dustin Pedroia under-performed, hitting below .200 in April.', u'Manager Terry Francona refused to bench him and his patience paid off as Pedroia eventually won the AL Rookie of the Year Award for his performance that season, which included 165 hits and a .317 batting average.', u'On the mound, Josh Beckett emerged as the ace of the staff with his first 20-win season, as fellow starting pitchers Schilling, Matsuzaka, Wakefield and Juli\xe1n Tav\xe1rez all struggled at times.', u'Relief pitcher Hideki Okajima, another recent arrival from the NPB, posted an ERA of 0.88 through the first half and was selected for the All-Star Game.', u"Okajima finished the season with a 2.22 ERA and 5 saves, emerging as one of baseball's top relievers.", u'Minor league call-up Clay Buchholz provided a spark on September 1 by pitching a no-hitter in his second career start.', u'The Red Sox captured their first AL East title since 1995.', u'The Red Sox swept the Angels in the ALDS.', u'Facing the Cleveland Indians in the ALCS, the Red Sox fell in games 2, 3, and 4 before Beckett picked up his second victory of the series in game 5, starting a comeback.', u'The Red Sox captured their twelfth American League pennant by outscoring the Indians 30\u20135 over the final three games.', u'The Red Sox faced the Colorado Rockies in the 2007 World Series, and swept the Rockies in four games.', u'In Game 4, Wakefield gave up his spot in the rotation to a recovered Jon Lester, who gave the Red Sox an impressive start, pitching 5\u2154 shutout innings.', u"Key home runs late in the game by third baseman Mike Lowell and pinch-hitter Bobby Kielty secured the Red Sox' second title in four years, as Lowell was named World Series MVP.", u'==== 2008\u20132012: Injuries and Collapses ====\n\nThe Red Sox struggled with injuries throughout the 2008 season.', u'Injuries to Schilling, relief pitcher Mike Timlin, and Beckett landed each pitcher on the disabled list before the 2008 season began, putting added pressure on young starters Lester and Buchholz.', u'Lester emerged as an anchor in the Red Sox rotation, leading the team in starts and innings pitched while compiling a 16\u20136 record and a 3.21 ERA.', u'Buchholz meanwhile struggled mightily in 2008 to a 2\u20139 record, ending up back in the minor leagues.', u"The Red Sox began their season by participating in the third opening day game in MLB history to be played in Japan, where they defeated the Oakland A's in the Tokyo Dome.", u'On May 19, Lester threw the 18th no-hitter in team history, defeating the Kansas City Royals 7\u20130.', u'However, despite early Red Sox success, the surprise Tampa Bay Rays led the AL East in early July.', u'Injuries would take a toll on the Red Sox offense during the season, most notably when David Ortiz missed 45 games with an injured wrist, Mike Lowell missed weeks with a torn hip labrum, and outfielder J. D. Drew aggravated a back injury that shelved him for much of the second half of the season.', u'Down the stretch, outfielder Manny Ramirez became embroiled in controversy surrounding public incidents with fellow players and other team employees, as well as criticism of ownership and not playing, which some claimed was due to laziness and nonexistent injuries.', u'The front office decided to move the disgrunted outfielder at the July 31 trade deadline, shipping him to the Dodgers in a three-way deal with the Pittsburgh Pirates that landed them Jason Bay to replace him in left field.', u'With Ramirez gone, and Bay providing a new spark in the lineup, the Red Sox improved vastly and made the playoffs as the AL Wild Card.', u'Ramirez ended up with the Los Angeles Dodgers.', u'Behind the strong playoff pitching of Lester, the Red Sox defeated the Angels in the 2008 ALDS three games to one.', u'The Red Sox then took on their AL East rivals the Tampa Bay Rays in the ALCS.', u'Down three games to one in the 5th game of the ALCS, Boston mounted a comeback from trailing 7-0 in the 7th inning to win 8-7.', u'They tied the series at 3 games apiece with a game 6 victory before losing game 7, 3\u20131, thus becoming the eighth team in a row since 2000 to fail to repeat as world champions.', u'In 2009, the Red Sox got into a rough start, but then won eleven games in a row.', u'During the first half of the season, star slugger David Ortiz had a very bad slump with a .185 average and one sole home run.', u"In response to poor offensive performance and to make room for Jed Lowrie's return from injury, shortstop Julio Lugo was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for cash and two minor-league players were traded to the Pirates for first baseman Adam LaRoche on July 22, who was soon traded to the Atlanta Braves for Casey Kotchman.", u'The Red Sox made a big move at the July 31 trade deadline, acquiring catcher Victor Martinez from the Cleveland Indians for three pitchers.', u'The Red Sox lost the last six games of the 2009 season to place the team second in the AL East, with the Yankees (who would later win the World Series).', u'The Red Sox entered the playoffs via the Wild Card, but were swept by the Los Angeles Angels in three games.', u"The Red Sox' 2010 season was highlighted by its many injuries to its players despite new additions to the team such as starting pitcher John Lackey, outfielder Mike Cameron and infielder Marco Scutaro.", u'Matsuzaka, Pedroia, and Youkilis ended the season early to recover their health, and Ellsbury spent most of the season on the bench due to injuries.', u'The Red Sox missed the playoffs for the first time since 2006, finishing in third place in the AL East.', u'After the season, Lowell decided to retire.', u'The Red Sox acquired superstar first baseman Adrian Gonzalez in a trade with the San Diego Padres and signed speedy outfielder Carl Crawford as an attempt to help the team return to the playoffs.', u'Entering the 2011 season, expectations were sky high and some baseball analysts even went as far as comparing the 2011 Red Sox to the legendary 1927 Yankees.', u'Despite the positive preseason predictions, the Red Sox struggled early in 2011, falling to an 0-6 start for the first time since 1945.', u'However, they gradually made their way into playoff contention by July, thanks to a potent offense which made up for a decimated pitching staff.', u'Matsuzaka and Buchholz ended their season with injuries, while new additions such as Andrew Miller, Alfredo Aceves and relief pitcher Daniel Bard proved their worth filling in for injured pitchers.', u'After rookie pitcher Kyle Weiland proved ineffective, the Red Sox made a three-way trade, giving up some prospects for \xc9rik B\xe9dard.', u'Due to further injuries in September, the Red Sox lost 11 out of 14 in that month, and their postseason aspirations were ultimately destroyed on September 28, 2011, losing to the Orioles by a score of 4\u20133 while the Rays clinched the American League Wild Card with a win over the Yankees on the same night.', u'The Red Sox missed the playoffs in consecutive seasons for the first time since missing three straight postseasons from 2000 to 2002.', u"Following the season, the Red Sox declined to exercise Terry Francona's 2012 contract option.", u"After the season, there was much controversy when it was claimed that the clubhouse didn't have solid leadership.", u'On some days, starting pitchers Lackey, Beckett, and Lester spent time in the dugout drinking.', u'Lester and the rest of the responsible pitchers stressed that they were only drinking when they had the day off pitching.', u'After the tumultuous end of the season, Theo Epstein left for the Chicago Cubs and was replaced by his previous assistant, Ben Cherington.', u'In December 2011, Bobby Valentine was hired as a new manager.', u'At about the same time, longtime closer Papelbon signed with the Philadelphia Phillies rather than re-sign with the Red Sox.', u"The 2012 season marked the centennial of Fenway Park, and on April 20, past and present Red Sox players and coaches assembled to celebrate the park's anniversary.", u'However, the collapse that they endured in September 2011 carried over into the season.', u'The Red Sox struggled throughout the season due to injuries, inconsistent play, and off-field news.', u'Many attempts to better the team through trades and free agent signing failed.', u'Amidst rumors that Valentine and Youkilis were not getting along, the Red Sox traded Youkilis to the Chicago White Sox on June 24.', u'On August 25, the Red Sox sent struggling players Gonzalez, Beckett, Crawford and infielder Nick Punto to the Los Angeles Dodgers for James Loney and four minor league prospects.', u'In addition to the clubhouse drinking, Beckett was also heavily connected to another incident where some of the players attended his charity bowling game rather than the funeral for Johnny Pesky, a longtime Red Sox shortstop, manager, and coach who died on August 13.', u'Coupled with a bizarre and inconsistent season, the one-time ace became a pariah to Red Sox Nation.', u'The Red Sox, realizing that the postseason was not in reach, decided to build with talent from their minor league system.', u'Over the next few months, minor league callups Will Middlebrooks, Pedro Ciriaco, Ryan Lavarnway and Daniel Nava were making regular appearances for the Red Sox.', u'The Red Sox finished 69\u201393 for their first losing season since 1997, and their worst season since 1965.', u'Bobby Valentine was subsequently fired on October 4, 2012.', u'Valentine has been replaced by John Farrell, who had spent the previous two seasons as manager of the Toronto Blue Jays.', u'Farrell was the pitching coach for the Red Sox from 2007\u20132010 before becoming manager of the Blue Jays.', u'==== Boston Strong: 2013 World Series Champions ====\n\nBoston, which finished last in the American League East with a 69\u201393 record in 2012\u201326 games behind the Yankees, became the 11th team in major league history to go from worst in the division to first the next season when it clinched the A.L.', u'East division title on September 21, 2013.', u"Many credit the team's turn around with the hiring of manager John Farrell, the former Red Sox pitching coach under Terry Francona from 2007 to 2010.", u'As a former member of the staff, he had the respect of influential players such as Lester, Pedroia, and Ortiz.', u'But there were other moves made in the offseason by general manager Ben Cherington who targeted "character" players to fill the team\'s needs.', u'These acquisitions included veteran catcher David Ross, Jonny Gomes, Mike Napoli, and Shane Victorino.', u'While some questioned these players as "re-treads", it was clear that Cherington was trying to move past 2011\u20132012 by bringing in "clubhouse players".', u'Essential to the turn around, however, was the pitching staff.', u'With ace veteran John Lackey coming off Tommy John surgery and both Jon Lester and Clay Buchholz returning to their prior form, this allowed the team to rely less on their bullpen.', u'Everything seemed in danger of collapsing, however, when both closers, Joel Hanrahan and Andrew Bailey, went down early with season-ending injuries.', u'Farrell gave the closing job to Koji Uehara on June 21 who delivered with a 1.09 ERA and an MLB record 0.565 WHIP.', u'On September 11, the 37-year-old right-hander set a new Red Sox record when he retired 33 straight batters.', u'Other reasons include the trade deadline acquisition of pitcher Jake Peavy when the Red Sox were in second place in the AL East, the depth of the bench with players such as Mike Carp and rookies Jackie Bradley, Jr. and Xander Bogaerts, and the re-emergence of players such as Will Middlebrooks and Daniel Nava.', u'On September 28, 2013, the team secured home field advantage throughout the American League playoffs when their closest competition, the Oakland Athletics, lost.', u'The next day, the team finished the season going 97\u201365, the best record in the American League and tied with the St. Louis Cardinals for the best record in baseball.', u'They proceeded to defeat the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2013 World Series, four games to two.', u'The Red Sox became the first team since the 1991 Minnesota Twins to win the World Series a year after finishing in last place, and the second overall.', u"The 2012 Red Sox' .426 winning percentage was the lowest for a team in a season prior to a World Series championship.", u'Throughout the season, the Red Sox players and organization formed a close association with the city of Boston and its people in relation to the Boston Marathon bombings that occurred on April 15, 2013.', u'On April 20, the day after the alleged bombers were captured, David Ortiz gave a pre-game speech following a ceremony honoring the victims and the local law enforcement, in which he stated, "This is our fucking city!', u'And nobody is going to dictate our freedom!', u'Stay strong!".', u'For the entirety of the season, the team wore an additional arm patch that exhibited the Red Sox "B" logo and the word "Strong" within a blue circle.', u'The team also hung up in the dugout a custom jersey that read "Boston Strong" with the number 617, representing the city of Boston\'s area code.', u'On many occasions during the season, victims of the attack and law enforcement involved were given the honor of throwing the ceremonial first pitch.', u"Following their victory in the 2013 World Series, the first one clinched at home in Fenway Park since 1918, Red Sox players Jonny Gomes and Jarrod Saltalamacchia performed a ceremony during the team's traditional duck boat victory parade, in which they placed the World Series trophy and the custom 617 jersey on the Boston Marathon finish line on Boylston Street, followed by a moment of silence and a singing of God Bless America.", u'This ceremony helped the city "reclaim" its spirit that was lost after the bombing.', u"Overall, the Red Sox team and organization played a role in the healing process after the tragedy, owing to the team's unifying effect on the city.", u"==== 2014 season ====\n\nGone from Boston's roster were core 2013 players such as center fielder Jacoby Ellsbury, catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia, and pitcher Ryan Dempster.", u'To help replace their needs, the Red Sox added catcher A. J. Pierzynski and outfielder Grady Sizemore, while also calling up young stars, outfielder Jackie Bradley Jr. and third baseman Xander Bogaerts.', u'During the season, the Red Sox struggled and released a number of veteran players including Sizemore, Pierzynski, and Chris Capuano while promoting top prospects such as Christian Vazquez and Mookie Betts.', u'At the end of July, the Red Sox traded away a number of members of the 2013 team: F\xe9lix Doubront, Jake Peavy, John Lackey, Jonny Gomes, Stephen Drew, and Jon Lester.', u'On September 10, the Red Sox were officially eliminated from the postseason, marking the fourth time in five seasons they did not qualify for the playoffs despite winning the World Series in the one year they did.', u'==== 2015 season ====\n\nPrior to the season, the Red Sox signed two major free agents: former Red Sox prospect Hanley Ram\xedrez to a four-year $80 million contract and former World Series MVP Pablo Sandoval to a five-year $100 million contract.', u'Later that offseason, the Red Sox signed another former prospect in starter Justin Masterson one-year $9.5 million deal.', u"The rebuilding wasn't done, as the Red Sox traded Allen Webster and Rubby De La Rosa to the Arizona Diamondbacks for left-handed starter Wade Miley on December 10, Yoenis C\xe9spedes, Alex Wilson and a prospect to the Detroit Tigers for right-hander Rick Porcello on December 11 and Will Middlebrooks to the San Diego Padres for catcher Ryan Hanigan on December 17.", u'The team also hired Chili Davis to be the new hitting coach.', u'Despite the active offseason, it was a tumultuous season for the Red Sox.', u'The team quickly fell to the bottom of the American League East, with criticism levied particularly at the rebuilt pitching staff.', u'On May 6, pitching coach Juan Nieves was relieved of his duties and replaced by Carl Willis.', u"Things didn't improve, however, and went from bad to worse in August when manager John Farrell announced he had cancer and was temporarily stepping down.", u'Bench coach Torey Lovullo took over managerial duties for the remainder of the season.', u'Ben Cherington was fired in August and replaced by former Marlins and Tigers GM Dave Dombrowski.', u'More pieces of the 2013 team moved on, with Shane Victorino, Daniel Nava and Mike Napoli all departing during the season.', u'In September, longtime president and CEO Larry Lucchino announced he was leaving the club.', u'In late September, the New England Sports Network announced popular longtime broadcaster Don Orsillo would not be offered a contract extension and leaving after the season, leading to fan protests.', u'Throughout the season, Sandoval and Ram\xedrez were criticized for not performing up to their large contracts.', u'Ram\xedrez, originally signed to be the everyday left fielder, was demoted from the outfield due to defensive difficulties.', u'Rick Porcello, who during the season became the highest-paid pitcher in team history, was also singled out for criticism.', u'Despite the negatives, Mookie Betts, Jackie Bradley, Jr., Xander Bogaerts, and Travis Shaw emerged as stars and Eduardo Rodr\xedguez as a frontline starter.', u'David Ortiz also hit his 500th career home run during the season.', u"==== 2016 season ====\n\nDave Dombrowski's first offseason in charge led to the Red Sox making a big splash, signing left-handed pitcher David Price.", u'A Cy Young winner and five time All-Star, Price signed for seven years and $217 million \u2013 the largest contract for a starting pitcher in baseball history.', u'Dombrowski also added bullpen help, trading Wade Miley and Jonathan Aro to the Seattle Mariners for Carson Smith and Roenis Elias, as well as trading top prospects Javier Guerra, Manuel Margot, Logan Allen and Carlos Asuaje to the San Diego Padres for Craig Kimbrel, one of the best closers in baseball.', u'The Red Sox also added outfielder Chris Young to shore up the bench.', u'== Current roster ==\n\n\n== Uniform ==\n\n\n== Spring training ==\n\n\n=== Truck Day ===\nThe unofficial beginning of the spring training season for the Red Sox is Truck Day, the day a tractor-trailer filled with equipment leaves Fenway Park bound for the Sox spring training facility in Florida.', u'Truck Day 2016 takes place on Wednesday, February 10, 2016.', u'=== City of Palms Park ===\nFormer left fielder Mike Greenwell is from Fort Myers, Florida and was instrumental in bringing his team to the city for spring training.', u'City of Palms Park was built in 1992 for that purpose and holds 8,000 people.', u'It is also the home of the Red Sox Rookie team, the Gulf Coast League Red Sox, from April through June.', u'=== JetBlue Park ===\nOn October 28, 2008, the Lee County commission voted 3\u20131 to approve an agreement with the Boston Red Sox to build a new spring-training facility for the team in south Lee County.', u'Commissioner Brian Bigelow was the lone dissenting vote.', u'Commissioner Bob Janes was not present for the vote, but stated that he supported it.', u'Dee was present in the chambers for the vote, and took the agreement back to Boston to meet with John Henry and other team officials.', u'On November 1, 2008, the Red Sox signed an agreement with Lee County that will keep their spring training home in the Fort Myers area for 30 more years.', u'Wednesday, April 30, 2009, the Lee County commissioners selected the Watermen-Pinnacle site on Daniels Parkway (a little more than a mile east of Interstate 75) as the site for the new facility.', u'The backup choice, if negotiations between county staff and the developer falter, is the University Highland site just north of Germain Arena in Estero.', u'Jeff Mudgett, a Fort Myers architect who is volunteering his time toward the project, envisions a facility with a mini-Fenway Park that would open for Spring 2012.', u'On March 29, 2011, it was announced that the new field would be named JetBlue Park at Fenway South.', u"The park was named JetBlue Park after JetBlue Airlines, which has maintained major operations at Boston's Logan International Airport since 2004.", u'Many characteristics of the stadium will be taken from Fenway Park, including a 37-foot (11 m) Green Monster wall in left field, featuring seating on top of and behind the wall.', u'Included in the wall will be a restored version of the manual scoreboard that was housed at Fenway for almost 30 years, beginning in the 1970s.', u'The field dimensions at JetBlue Park will be identical to those at Fenway.', u'== Rivalry with the Yankees ==\n\nThe Yankees\u2013Red Sox rivalry is one of the oldest, most famous and fiercest rivalries in professional sports.', u'For over 100 years, the Red Sox and New York Yankees have been rivals.', u'The rivalry is often a heated subject of conversation in the Northeastern United States.', u'Since the inception of the wild card team and an added Division Series, every playoffs has featured one or both of the American League East rivals and they both have squared off in the American League Championship Series three times, with the Yankees winning twice in 1999 and 2003 and the Sox winning in 2004.', u'In addition, the teams have twice met in the last regular-season series of a season to decide the league title, in 1904 (when the Red Sox won) and 1949 (when the Yankees won).', u'The teams also finished tied for first in 1978, when the Yankees won a high-profile one-game playoff for the division title.', u'The 1978 division race is memorable for the Red Sox having held a 14-game lead over the Yankees more than halfway through the season.', u'Similarly, the 2004 AL Championship Series is notable for the Yankees leading 3 games to 0 and ultimately losing a best of seven series.', u'The Red Sox comeback was the only time in baseball history that a team has come back from a 0\u20133 deficit to win a series.', u'The rivalry is often termed "the best" and "greatest rivalry in all of sports."', u'Games between the two teams often generate a great deal of interest and get extensive media coverage, including being broadcast on national television.', u'== Radio and television ==\n\nCurrently, the flagship radio station of the Red Sox is WEEI-FM/93.7.', u"Joe Castiglione, in his 25th year as the voice of the Red Sox, serves as the lead play-by-play announcer, along with Dave O'Brien and Jon Rish.", u"Some of Castiglione's predecessors include Curt Gowdy, Ken Coleman, and Ned Martin.", u'He has also worked with play-by-play veterans Bob Starr and Jerry Trupiano.', u'Many stations throughout New England and beyond pick up the broadcasts.', u'All Red Sox telecasts not shown nationally on Fox or ESPN are seen on New England Sports Network (NESN), until 2015 with Don Orsillo calling play-by-play and Jerry Remy, former Red Sox second baseman, as color analyst.', u"At the start of the 2016 season, Dave O'Brien took over the play-by-play duties.", u"During Remy's recovery from cancer, former Red Sox players Dennis Eckersley and Dave Roberts have alternated doing color commentary.", u'NESN became exclusive in 2006; before then, games were shown on such local stations as the original WHDH-TV, WNAC-TV (now the current WHDH), WBZ-TV, WSBK-TV, WLVI, WABU, and WFXT at various points in team history.', u'== Retired numbers ==\n\nThe Red Sox used to publish on their website and their annual media guides three official requirements for a player to have his number retired:\nElection to the National Baseball Hall of Fame\nAt least 10 years played with the Red Sox\nFinished his career with the club.', u'These requirements were reconsidered after the election of Carlton Fisk to the Hall of Fame in 2000; who met the first 2 requirements but played the second half of his career with the White Sox.', u'As a means of meeting the criteria, then-GM Dan Duquette hired Fisk for one day as a special assistant, which allowed Fisk to technically finish his career with the Red Sox.', u'In 2008, the Red Sox made an "exception" by retiring #6 for Johnny Pesky.', u'Pesky neither spent ten years as a player nor was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame; however, Red Sox ownership cited "... his versatility of his contributions\u2014on the field, off the field, [and] in the dugout ...", including as a manager, scout, and special instructor and decided that the honor had been well-earned.', u'Pesky spent 55 years with the Red Sox organization; as a player (1942, 1946-1952), minor league manager (1961-1962, 1990), major league manager (1963-1964, 1980), broadcaster (1969-1974), major league coach (1975-1984), and as a special instructor and assistant general manager (1985-2012).', u"In 2015, the Red Sox chose to forgo the official criteria and retire Pedro Mart\xednez's #45.", u'Mart\xednez only spent 7 of his 18 seasons in Boston.', u'In justifying the number\'s retirement, Red Sox principal owner John Henry stated, "To be elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame upon his first year of eligibility speaks volumes regarding Pedro\'s outstanding career, and is a testament to the respect and admiration so many in baseball have for him."', u'After which, the official criteria no longer appeared on the team website nor future media guides.', u"During pre-game ceremonies in honor of the final game of David Ortiz's career on October 2, 2016, the Red Sox announced that they will retire #34 in Ortiz's honor at a ceremony during the 2017 season.", u'The number 42 was officially retired by Major League Baseball in 1997, but Mo Vaughn was one of a handful of players to continue wearing #42 through a grandfather clause.', u'He last wore it for the team in 1998.', u'In commemoration of Jackie Robinson Day, MLB invited players to wear the number 42 for games played on April 15, Coco Crisp (CF), David Ortiz (DH), and DeMarlo Hale (Coach) did that in 2007 and again in 2008.', u'Starting in 2009, MLB had all uniformed players for all teams wear #42 for Jackie Robinson Day.', u'While not officially retired, the Red Sox have not issued several numbers since the departure of prominent figures who wore them, specifically:\n21: Roger Clemens RHP (1984\u20131996).', u'33: Jason Varitek C (1997\u20132011); retired as member of Red Sox.', u'49: Tim Wakefield RHP (1995\u20132011); retired as member of Red Sox.', u"There has also been debate in Boston media circles and among fans about the potential retiring of Tony Conigliaro's number 25.", u"Nonetheless, since Conigliaro's last full season in Boston, 1970, the number has been assigned to 15 individuals, including players Orlando Cepeda, Mark Clear, Don Baylor, Larry Parrish, Jack Clark, Troy O'Leary, Jeremy Giambi and Mike Lowell; coach Dwight Evans, and manager Bobby Valentine.", u'#25 is currently worn by OF Jackie Bradley, Jr.\nUntil the late 1990s, the numbers originally hung on the right-field facade in the order in which they were retired: 9\u20134\u20131\u20138.', u'It was pointed out that the numbers, when read as a date (9/4/18), marked the eve of the first game of the 1918 World Series, the last championship series that the Red Sox won before 2004.', u'After the facade was repainted, the numbers were rearranged in numerical order.', u"In 2012, the numbers were rearranged again in chronological order of retirement (9, 4, 1, 8, 27, 6, 14, 45, 26) followed by Robinson's 42.", u'== Baseball Hall of Famers ==\n\n\n=== Ford C. Frick Award recipients ===\n\n\n== Minor league affiliations ==\n\n\n== Other notable seasons and team records ==\n\nNomar Garciaparra hit .372 in 2000, the club record for a right-handed hitter.', u'David Ortiz in 2005 had 47 home runs and 148 RBIs.', u"He also had many game winning and timely hits and came in second in the MVP voting to the New York Yankees' Alex Rodriguez.", u'David Ortiz had a franchise record-breaking 2006 season with 54 home runs in the regular season\nOn April 22, 2007, Manny Ram\xedrez, J. D.

{'sentences': [u'Eton College /i\u02d0t\u0259n/ is an independent boarding school for boys in Eton, Berkshire, near Windsor.', u'It educates more than 1,300 pupils, aged 13 to 18 years.', u'It was founded in 1440 by King Henry VI as "The King\'s College of Our Lady of Eton besides Wyndsor", making it the 18th oldest Headmasters\' and Headmistresses\' Conference (HMC) school.', u'Eton is one of ten English HMC schools, commonly referred to as "public schools", regulated by the Public Schools Act of 1868.', u"Following the public school tradition, Eton is a full boarding school, which means all pupils live at the school, and it is one of four such remaining single-sex boys' public schools in the United Kingdom (the others being Harrow, Radley, and Winchester) to continue this practice.", u"Eton has educated 19 British prime ministers and generations of the aristocracy and has been referred to as the chief nurse of England's statesmen.", u'Charging up to \xa311,478 per term (there are three terms per academic year) in 2014/15, Eton is the sixth most expensive HMC boarding school in the UK.', u'== Background ==\nEton has a long list of distinguished former pupils.', u'David Cameron was the 19th British prime minister to have attended the school, and recommended that Eton set up a school in the state sector to help drive up standards.', u'Eton now co-sponsors a state sixth-form college in Newham, a deprived area of East London, called the London Academy of Excellence, opened in 2012, which is free of charge and aims to get all its students into higher education.', u'In September 2014, Eton opened, and became the sole educational sponsor for, a new purpose-built co-educational state boarding and day school for around 500 pupils, Holyport College, in Maidenhead in Berkshire, with construction costing around \xa315 million, in which a fifth of places for day pupils will be set aside for children from poor homes, 21 boarding places will go to youngsters on the verge of being taken into care, and a further 28 boarders will be funded or part-funded through bursaries.', u'About 20% of pupils at Eton receive financial support, through a range of bursaries and scholarships.', u'The recent Head Master, Tony Little, said that Eton is developing plans to allow any boy to attend the school whatever his parents\' income and, in 2011, said that around 250 boys received "significant" financial help from the school.', u'In early 2014, this figure had risen to 263 pupils receiving the equivalent of around 60% of school fee assistance, whilst a further 63 received their education free of charge.', u'Little said that, in the short term, he wanted to ensure that around 320 pupils per year receive bursaries, and that 70 were educated free of charge, with the intention that the number of pupils receiving financial assistance would continue to increase.', u'These comparatively new developments will run alongside long-established courses that Eton has provided for pupils from state schools, most of them in the summer holidays (July and August).', u'Launched in 1982, the Universities Summer School is an intensive residential course open to boys and girls throughout the UK who attend state schools, are at the end of their first year in the Sixth Form, and are about to begin their final year of schooling.', u'The Brent-Eton Summer School, started in 1994, offers 40\u201350 young people from the London Borough of Brent, an area of inner-city deprivation, an intensive one-week residential course, free of charge, designed to help bridge the gap between GCSE and A-level.', u'In 2008, Eton helped found the Eton, Slough, Windsor and Hounslow Independent and State School Partnership (ISSP), with six local state schools.', u'The ISSP\'s aims are "to raise pupil achievement, improve pupil self-esteem, raise pupil aspirations and improve professional practice across the schools".', u'Eton also runs a number of choral and English language courses during the summer months.', u"In the run-up to the London 2012 Summer Olympic Games and London 2012 Summer Paralympic Games, Eton's purpose-built Dorney Lake, a permanent, eight-lane, 2,200 metre course (about 1.4 miles) in a 400-acre park, officially known throughout the Games as Eton Dorney, provided training facilities for Olympic and Paralympic competitors, and during the Games, hosted the Olympic and Paralympic Rowing competitions as well as the Olympic Canoe Sprint event, attracting over 400,000 visitors during the Games period (around 30,000 per day), and voted the best 2012 Olympic venue by spectators.", u'Access to the parkland around the Lake is provided to members of the public, free of charge, almost all the year round.', u'In the past, Eton has educated generations of British and foreign aristocracy, and for the first time, members of the Royal family, Prince William and his brother Prince Harry, in contrast to the Royal tradition of male education at either naval college or Gordonstoun, or by Palace tutors.', u"Registration at birth has been consigned to the past, and by the mid-1990s, Eton ranked among Britain's top three schools in getting its pupils into Oxford and Cambridge.", u'Eton has traditionally been referred to as "the chief nurse of England\'s statesmen", and has been described as the most famous public school in the world.', u'Early in the 20th century, a historian of Eton wrote, "No other school can claim to have sent forth such a cohort of distinguished figures to make their mark on the world."', u'The Good Schools Guide called the school "the number one boys\' public school", adding that "The teaching and facilities are second to none."', u'The school is a member of the G20 Schools Group.', u'== Overview ==\nThe school is headed by a Provost and Fellows (Board of Governors), who appoint the head master.', u"It contains 25 boys' houses, each headed by a House Master, selected from the more senior members of the teaching staff, who number some 160.", u"Almost all of the school's pupils go on to universities, about a third of them to Oxford or Cambridge.", u"The Head Master is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference and the school is a member of the Eton Group of independent schools in the United Kingdom.", u'Eton today is a larger school than it has been for much of its history.', u'In 1678, there were 207 boys.', u'In the late 18th century, there were about 300, while today, the total has risen to over 1,300.', u"== History ==\n\nEton College was founded by King Henry VI as a charity school to provide free education to 70 poor boys who would then go on to King's College, Cambridge, founded by the same King in 1441.", u'Henry took Winchester College as his model, visiting on many occasions, borrowing its Statutes and removing its Headmaster and some of the Scholars to start his new school.', u'When Henry VI founded the school, he granted it a large number of endowments, including much valuable land.', u"The group of feoffees appointed by the king to receive forfeited lands of the Alien Priories for the endowment of Eton were as follows:\nArchbishop Chichele\nBishop Stafford\nBishop Lowe\nBishop Ayscough\nWilliam de la Pole, 1st Marquess of Suffolk (1396\u20131450) (later Duke of Suffolk)\nJohn Somerset (d. 1454), Chancellor of the Exchequer and the king's doctor\nThomas Beckington (c. 1390\u20131465), Archdeacon of Buckingham, the king's secretary and later Keeper of the Privy Seal\nRichard Andrew (d. 1477), first Warden of All Souls College, Oxford, later the king's secretary\nAdam Moleyns (d. 1450), Clerk of the Council\nJohn Hampton (d. 1472) of Kniver, Staffordshire, an Esquire of the Body\nJames Fiennes, another member of the Royal Household\nWilliam Tresham, another member of the Royal Household\nIt was intended to have formidable buildings (Henry intended the nave of the College Chapel to be the longest in Europe) and several religious relics, supposedly including a part of the True Cross and the Crown of Thorns.", u'He persuaded the then Pope, Eugene IV, to grant him a privilege unparalleled anywhere in England: the right to grant indulgences to penitents on the Feast of the Assumption.', u"The school also came into possession of one of England's Apocalypse manuscripts.", u"However, when Henry was deposed by King Edward IV in 1461, the new King annulled all grants to the school and removed most of its assets and treasures to St George's Chapel, Windsor, on the other side of the River Thames.", u"Legend has it that Edward's mistress, Jane Shore, intervened on the school's behalf.", u'She was able to save a good part of the school, although the royal bequest and the number of staff were much reduced.', u'Construction of the chapel, originally intended to be slightly over twice as long, with eighteen\u2014or possibly seventeen\u2014bays (there are eight today) was stopped when Henry VI was deposed.', u'Only the Quire of the intended building was completed.', u"Eton's first Headmaster, William Waynflete, founder of Magdalen College, Oxford and previously Head Master of Winchester College, built the ante-chapel that finishes the Chapel today.", u'The important wall paintings in the Chapel and the brick north range of the present School Yard also date from the 1480s; the lower storeys of the cloister, including College Hall, had been built between 1441 and 1460.', u'As the school suffered reduced income while still under construction, the completion and further development of the school has since depended to some extent on wealthy benefactors.', u'Building resumed when Roger Lupton was Provost, around 1517.', u'His name is borne by the big gate-house in the west range of the cloisters, fronting School Yard, perhaps the most famous image of the school.', u'This range includes the important interiors of the Parlour, Election Hall, and Election Chamber, where most of the 18th century "leaving portraits" are kept.', u'"After Lupton\'s time nothing important was built until about 1670, when Provost Allestree gave a range to close the west side of School Yard between Lower School and Chapel".', u'This was remodelled later and completed 1694 by Matthew Bankes, Master Carpenter of the Royal Works.', u'The last important addition to the central college buildings was the College Library, in the south range of the cloister, 1725\u201329, by Thomas Rowland.', u'It has a very important collection of books and manuscripts.', u'In the 19th century, the architect John Shaw Jr (1803\u20131870) became surveyor to Eton.', u"He designed New Buildings (1844\u201346), Provost Francis Hodgson's addition to provide better accommodation for Collegers, who until then had mostly lived in Long Chamber, a long first floor room where conditions were inhumane.", u'Following complaints about the finances, buildings and management of Eton, the Clarendon Commission was set up in 1861 as a Royal Commission to investigate the state of nine schools in England, including Eton.', u'Questioned by the Commission in 1862, head master Edward Balston came under attack for his view that in the classroom little time could be spared for subjects other than classical studies.', u'The Duke of Wellington is often incorrectly quoted as saying that "The Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing-fields of Eton".', u'Wellington was at Eton from 1781 to 1784 and was to send his sons there.', u'According to Nevill (citing the historian Sir Edward Creasy), what Wellington said, while passing an Eton cricket match many decades later, was, "There grows the stuff that won Waterloo", a remark Nevill construes as a reference to "the manly character induced by games and sport" among English youth generally, not a comment about Eton specifically.', u'In 1889, Sir William Fraser conflated this uncorroborated remark with the one attributed to him by Count Charles de Montalembert\'s "C\'est ici qu\'a \xe9t\xe9 gagn\xe9 la bataille de Waterloo" ("It is here that the Battle of Waterloo was won.")', u'As with other public schools, a scheme was devised towards the end of the 19th century to familiarize privileged schoolboys with social conditions in deprived areas.', u"The project of establishing an 'Eton Mission' in the crowded district of Hackney Wick in east London was started at the beginning of 1880, and lasted until 1971 when it was decided that a more local project (at Dorney) would be more realistic.", u"However over the years much money was raised for the Eton Mission, a fine church by G. F. Bodley was erected, many Etonians visited, and stimulated among other things the Eton Manor Boys' Club, a notable rowing club which has survived the Mission itself, and the 59 Club for motorcyclists.", u"The very large and ornate School Hall and School Library (by L. K. Hall) were erected in 1906\u201308 across the road from Upper School as the school's memorial to the Etonians who had died in the Boer War.", u'Many tablets in the cloisters and chapel commemorate the large number of dead Etonians of the Great War.', u'A bomb destroyed part of Upper School in World War II and blew out many windows in the Chapel.', u'The college commissioned replacements by Evie Hone (1949\u201352) and by John Piper and Patrick Reyntiens (1959 onward).', u'Among headmasters of the 20th century were Cyril Alington, Robert Birley and Anthony Chenevix-Trench.', u'M. R. James was a provost.', u"In 1959, the College constructed a nuclear bunker to house the College's Provost and Fellows.", u'The facility is now used for storage.', u'In 2005, the School was one of fifty of the country\'s leading independent schools found to have breached the Competition Act (see below under "Controversy").', u'In 2011, plans to attack Eton were found on the body of a senior al-Qaeda leader shot dead in Somalia.', u'In the past, people at Eton have occasionally been guilty of antisemitism.', u"For a time, new admissions were called 'Jews' by their fellow Collegers.", u"[5] In 1945, the school introduced a nationality statute conditioning entry on the applicant's father being British by birth.", u'The statute was removed after the intervention of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan in the 1960s after it came to the attention of Oxford\'s Wykeham Professor of Logic, A. J. Ayer, himself Jewish and an Old Etonian, who "suspected a whiff of anti-semitism".', u'== School terms ==\nThere are three academic terms (known as halves) in the year,\nThe Michaelmas Half, from early September to mid December.', u'New boys are now admitted only at the start of the Michaelmas Half, unless in exceptional circumstances.', u'The Lent Half, from mid-January to late March.', u'The Summer Half, from late April to late June or early July.', u'They are called halves because the school year was once split into two halves, between which the boys went home.', u"== Boys' houses ==\n\n\n=== King's Scholars ===\n\nOne boarding house, College, is reserved for 70 King's Scholars, who attend Eton on scholarships provided by the original foundation and awarded by examination each year; King's Scholars pay up to 90 percent of full fees, depending on their means.", u'Of the other pupils, up to a third receive some kind of bursary or scholarship.', u'The name "King\'s Scholars" is because the school was founded by King Henry VI in 1440.', u"The original School consisted of the 70 Scholars (together with some Commensals) and the Scholars were educated and boarded at the foundation's expense.", u'King\'s Scholars are entitled to use the letters "KS" after their name and they can be identified by a black gown worn over the top of their tailcoats, giving them the nickname tugs (Latin: togati, wearers of gowns); and occasionally by a surplice in Chapel.', u'The house is looked after by the Master in College.', u"=== Oppidans ===\nAs the School grew, more students were allowed to attend provided that they paid their own fees and lived in the town, outside the College's original buildings.", u'These students became known as Oppidans, from the Latin word oppidum, meaning town.', u'The Houses developed over time as a means of providing residence for the Oppidans in a more congenial manner, and during the 18th and 19th centuries were mostly run by women known as "dames".', u'They typically contain about fifty boys.', u'Although classes are organised on a School basis, most boys spend a large proportion of their time in their House.', u'Each House has a formal name, mainly used for post and people outside the Eton community.', u'It is generally known by the boys by the initials or surname of the House Master, the teacher who lives in the house and manages the pupils in it.', u"Not all boys who pass the College election examination choose to become King's Scholars.", u'If they choose instead to belong to one of the 24 Oppidan Houses, they are known as Oppidan Scholars.', u'Oppidan scholarships may also be awarded for consistently performing with distinction in School and external examinations.', u'To gain an Oppidan Scholarship, a boy must have either three distinctions in a row or four throughout his career.', u'Within the school, an Oppidan Scholar is entitled to use the letters OS after his name.', u"The Oppidan Houses are named Godolphin House, Jourdelay's, (both built as such c. 1720), Hawtrey House, Durnford House, (the first two built as such by the Provost and Fellows, 1845, when the school was increasing in numbers and needed more centralised control), The Hopgarden, South Lawn, Waynflete, Evans's, Keate House, Warre House, Villiers House, Common Lane House, Penn House, Walpole House, Cotton Hall, Wotton House, Holland House, Mustians, Angelo's, Manor House, Farrer House, Baldwin's Bec, The Timbralls, and Westbury.", u'=== House structure ===\n\nIn addition to the House Master, each house has a House Captain and a House Captain of Games.', u'Some Houses have more than one.', u'House prefects were once elected from the oldest year, but this no longer happens.', u"The old term, Library, survives in the name of the room set aside for the oldest year's use, where boys have their own kitchen.", u'Similarly, boys in their penultimate year have a room known as Debate.', u'There are entire house gatherings every evening, usually around 8:05\u20138:30 p.m.', u'These are known as Prayers, due to their original nature.', u'The House Master and boys have an opportunity to make announcements, and sometimes the boys provide light entertainment.', u'For much of Eton\'s history, junior boys had to act as "fags", or servants, to older boys.', u'Their duties included cleaning, cooking, and running errands.', u'A Library member was entitled to yell at any time and without notice, "Boy, Up!"', u'or "Boy, Queue!', u'", and all first-year boys had to come running.', u'The last boy to arrive was given the task.', u'These practices, known as fagging, were partially phased out of most houses in the 1970s.', u'Captains of House and Games still sometimes give tasks to first-year boys, such as collecting the mail from School Office.', u'There are many inter-house competitions, mostly in sports.', u'== Head Masters: 1442\u2013present ==\n\n\n== Uniform ==\n\nThe School is known for its traditions, including a uniform of black tailcoat (or morning coat) and waistcoat, false-collar and pinstriped trousers.', u'Most pupils wear a white tie that is effectively a strip of cloth folded over into a starched, detachable collar, but some senior boys are entitled to wear a white bow tie and winged collar ("Stick-Ups").', u"There are some variations in the school dress worn by boys in authority, see School Prefects and King's Scholars sections.", u'The long-standing claim that the present uniform was first worn as mourning for the death of George III is unfounded.', u'"Eton dress" has undergone significant changes since its standardisation in the 19th century.', u'Originally (along with a top-hat and walking-cane), Etonian dress was reserved for formal occasions, but boys wear it today for classes, which are referred to as "divisions", or "divs".', u"As stated above, King's Scholars wear a black gown over the top of their tailcoats, and occasionally a surplice in Chapel.", u'Members of the teaching staff (known as Beaks) are required to wear a form of school dress when teaching.', u'From 1820 until 1967, boys under the height of 5\'4" (1.63 m) were required to wear the \'Eton suit\', which replaced the tailcoat with the cropped \'Eton jacket\' (known colloquially as a "bum-freezer") and included an \'Eton collar\', a large, stiff-starched, white collar.', u'The Eton suit was copied by other schools and has remained in use in some, particularly choir schools.', u'== Tutors and teaching ==\nThe pupil to teacher ratio is 8:1, which is low by general school standards.', u'Class sizes start at around twenty to twenty-five in the first year and are often below ten by the final year.', u'The original curriculum concentrated on prayers, Latin and devotion, and "as late as 1530 no Greek was taught".', u'Later the emphasis was on classical studies, dominated by Latin and Ancient History, and, for boys with sufficient ability, Classical Greek.', u'From the latter part of the 19th century this curriculum has changed and broadened: for example, there are now more than 100 students of Chinese, which is a non-curriculum course.', u'In the 1970s, there was just one school computer, in a small room attached to the science buildings.', u'It used paper tape to store programs.', u"Today, all boys must have laptop computers, and the school fibre-optic network connects all classrooms and all boys' bedrooms to the internet.", u"The primary responsibility for a boy's studies lies with his House Master, but he is assisted by an additional director of studies, known as a tutor.", u'Classes, colloquially known as "divs" (divisions), are organised on a School basis; the classrooms are separate from the houses.', u'New school buildings have appeared for teaching purposes every decade or so since New Schools, designed by Henry Woodyer and built 1861\u201363.', u'Despite the introduction of modern technology, the external appearance and locations of many of the classrooms have remained unchanged for a long time.', u'Every evening, about an hour and a quarter, known as Quiet Hour, is set aside, during which boys are expected to study or prepare work for their teachers if not otherwise engaged.', u'Some Houses, at the discretion of the House Master, may observe a second Quiet Hour after prayers in the evening.', u"This is less formal, with boys being allowed to visit each other's rooms to socialise if neither boy has work outstanding.", u'The Independent Schools Inspectorate\'s latest report says, "Eton College provides an exceptionally good quality of education for all its pupils.', u'They achieve high academic standards as a result of stimulating teaching, challenging expectations and first-class resources."', u"== Societies ==\nAt Eton, there are dozens of organisations known as 'societies', in many of which pupils come together to discuss a particular topic, presided over by a master, and often including a guest speaker.", u'At any one time there are about fifty societies and clubs in existence, catering for a wide range of interests and largely run by boys.', u'Societies tend to come and go, depending on the special enthusiasms of the masters and boys in the school at the time, but some have been in existence many years.', u'Those in existence at present include: Aeronautical, African, Alexander Cozens (Art), Amnesty, Archeological, Architectural, Astronomy, Banks (conservation), Caledonian, Cheese, Classical, Comedy, Cosmopolitan, Debating, Design, Entrepreneurship, Geographical, Geopolitical, Henry Fielding, Hispanic, History, Keynes (economics), Law, Literary, Mathematical, Medical, Middle Eastern, Model United Nations, Modern Languages, Oriental, Orwell (left-wing), Simeon (Christian), Parry (music), Photographic, Political, Praed (poetry), Rock (music), Rous (equestrian), Salisbury (diplomatic), Savile (Rare Books and Manuscripts), Shelley, Scientific, Sports, Tech Club, Theatre, Wellington (military), Wine and Wotton\u2019s (philosophy).', u'Among past guest speakers are Andrew Lloyd Webber, J. K. Rowling, Vivienne Westwood, Ian McKellen, Kevin Warwick, Boris Johnson, Rowan Atkinson, Ralph Fiennes, Terry Wogan, King Constantine II of Greece, Katie Price, Zoe Wanamaker, Boris Berezovsky and Kit Hesketh-Harvey.', u'== Grants and prizes ==\nPrizes are awarded on the results of trials (internal exams), GCSE and AS-levels.', u'In addition, many subjects and activities have specially endowed prizes, several of which are awarded by visiting experts.', u'The most prestigious is the Newcastle Scholarship, awarded on the strength of an examination, consisting of two papers in philosophical theology, moral theory and applied ethics.', u'Also of note are the Gladstone Memorial Prize and the Coutts Prize, awarded on the results of trials and AS-level examinations in C; and the Huxley Prize, awarded for a project on a scientific subject.', u"Other specialist prizes include the Newcastle Classical Prize; the Rosebery Exhibition for History; the Queen's Prizes for French and German; the Duke of Newcastle's Russian Prize; the Beddington Spanish Prize; the Strafford and Bowman Shakespeare Prizes; the Tomline and Russell Prizes in Mathematics; the Sotheby Prize for History of Art; the Waddington Prize for Theology and Philosophy; the Birley Prize for History; The Lower Boy Rosebery Prize and the Wilder Prize for Theology.", u'Prizes are awarded too for excellence in such activities as painting, sculpture, ceramics, playing musical instruments, musical composition, declamation, silverwork, and design.', u'Various benefactions make it possible to give grants each year to boys who wish, for educational or cultural reasons, to work or travel abroad.', u'These include the Busk Fund, which supports individual ventures that show particular initiative; the C. M. Wells Memorial Trust Fund, for the promotion of visits to classical lands; the Sadler Fund, which supports, among others, those intending to enter the Foreign Service; and the Marsden Fund, for travel in countries where the principal language is not English.', u'== Incentives and sanctions ==\nEton has a well-established system for encouraging boys to produce high-standard work.', u'An excellent piece of work may be rewarded with a "Show Up", to be shown to the boy\'s tutors as evidence of progress.', u'If, in any particular term, a pupil makes a particularly good effort in any subject, he may be "Commended for Good Effort" to the Head Master (or Lower Master).', u'If any boy produces an outstanding piece of work, it may be "Sent Up For Good", storing the effort in the College Archives for posterity.', u'This award has been around since the 18th century.', u"As Sending Up For Good is fairly infrequent, the process is rather mysterious to many of Eton's boys.", u'First, the master wishing to Send Up For Good must gain the permission of the relevant Head of Department.', u'Upon receiving his or her approval, the piece of work will be marked with Sent Up For Good and the student will receive a card to be signed by House Master, tutor and division master.', u'The opposite of a Show Up is a "Rip".', u"This is for sub-standard work, which is sometimes torn at the top of the page/sheet and must be submitted to the boy's housemaster for signature.", u'Boys who accumulate rips are liable to be given a "White Ticket", which must be signed by all his teachers and may be accompanied by other punishments, usually involving doing domestic chores or writing lines.', u'In recent times, a milder form of the rip, \'sign for information\', colloquially known as an "info", has been introduced, which must also be signed by the boy\'s housemaster and tutor.', u'Internal examinations are held at the end of the Michaelmas term for all pupils, and in the Summer term for those in the first, second and fourth years.', u'These internal examinations are called "Trials".', u'A boy who is late for any division or other appointment may be required to sign "Tardy Book", a register kept in the School Office, between 7:35am and 7:45am, every morning for the duration of his sentence (typically three days).', u'Tardy Book may also be issued for late work.', u'For more serious misdeeds, a boy is summoned from his lessons to the Head Master, or Lower Master if the boy is in the lower two years, to talk personally about his misdeeds.', u'This is known as the "Bill".', u'The most serious misdeeds may result in expulsion, or rustication (suspension).', u'Conversely, should a master be more than 15 minutes late for a class, traditionally the pupils might claim it as a "run" and absent themselves for the rest of its duration.', u'A traditional form of punishment took the form of being made to copy, by hand, Latin hexameters.', u'Miscreants were frequently set 100 hexameters by Library members, or, for more serious offences, Georgics (more than 500 hexameters) by their House Masters or the Head Master.', u'The giving of a Georgic is now extremely rare, but still occasionally occurs.', u'=== Corporal punishment ===\nEton used to be renowned for its use of corporal punishment, generally known as "beating".', u'In the 16th century, Friday was set aside as "flogging day".', u'Beating was phased out in the 1980s.', u'The film director Sebastian Doggart claims to have been the last boy caned at Eton, in 1984.', u'Until 1964, offending boys could be summoned to the Head Master or the Lower Master, as appropriate, to receive a birching on the bare posterior, in a semi-public ceremony held in the Library, where there was a special wooden birching block over which the offender was held.', u'John Keate, Head Master from 1809 to 1834, took over at a time when discipline was poor.', u'Anthony Chenevix-Trench, Head Master from 1964 to 1970, abolished the birch and replaced it with caning, also applied to the bare posterior, which he administered privately in his office.', u'Chenevix-Trench also abolished corporal punishment administered by senior boys.', u'Previously, House Captains were permitted to cane miscreants over the seat of the trousers.', u'This was a routine occurrence, carried out privately with the boy bending over with his head under the edge of a table.', u'Less common but more severe were the canings administered by Pop (see Eton Society below) in the form of a "Pop-Tanning", in which a large number of hard strokes were inflicted by the President of Pop in the presence of all Pop members (or, in earlier times, each member of Pop took it in turns to inflict a stroke).', u'The culprit was summoned to appear in a pair of old trousers, as the caning would cut the cloth to shreds.', u'This was the most severe form of physical punishment at Eton.', u"Chenevix-Trench's successor from 1970, Michael McCrum, retained private corporal punishment by masters, but ended the practice of requiring boys to take their trousers and underwear down when bending over to be caned by the Head Master.", u'By the mid-1970s, the only people allowed to administer caning were the Head Master and the Lower Master.', u'== Prefects ==\nIn addition to the masters, the following three categories of senior boys are entitled to exercise School discipline.', u'Boys who belong to any of these categories, in addition to a limited number of other boy office holders, are entitled to wear winged collars with bow ties.', u'Eton Society: commonly known as Pop.', u'Over the years its power and privileges have grown.', u'Pop is the oldest self-electing society at Eton.', u'The rules were altered in 1987 and again in 2005 so that the new intake are not elected solely by the existing year and a committee of masters.', u'Members of Pop are entitled to wear checked spongebag trousers, and a waistcoat designed as they wish.', u'Historically, only members of Pop were entitled to furl their umbrellas or sit on the wall on the Long Walk, in front of the main building.', u'However, this tradition has died out.', u"They perform roles at many of the routine events of the school year, including School Plays, parents' evenings and other official events.", u'Notable ex-members of Pop include Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, Eddie Redmayne and Boris Johnson.', u"Sixth Form Select: an academically selected prefectorial group consisting, by custom, of the 10 senior King's Scholars and the 10 senior Oppidan Scholars.", u'Members of Sixth Form Select are entitled to wear silver buttons on their waistcoats.', u'They also act as Praepostors: they enter classrooms and ask, "Is (family name) in this division?"', u'followed by "He\'s to see the Head Master at (time)" (the Bill, see above).', u'Members of Sixth Form Select also perform "Speeches", a formal event held five times a year.', u"House Captains: The captains of each of the 25 boys' houses (see above) have disciplinary powers at school level.", u'House Captains are entitled to wear a mottled-grey waistcoat.', u'It is possible to belong to the Eton Society and Sixth Form Select at the same time.', u'In the era of Queen Elizabeth I there were two praepostors in every form, who noted down the names of absentees.', u'Until the late 19th century, there was a praepostor for every division of the school.', u'== Sports ==\nSport is a feature of Eton; there is an extensive network of playing fields.', u'Their names include Agar\'s Plough, Dutchman\'s, Upper Club, Lower Club, Sixpenny/The Field, and Mesopotamia (situated between two streams and often shortened to "Mespots").', u'During the Michaelmas Half, the sport curriculum is dominated by football (called Association) and rugby union, with some rowing for a smaller number of boys.', u'During the Lent Half it is dominated by the field game, a code of football, but this is unique to Eton and cannot be played against other schools.', u'During this half, Collegers also play the Eton wall game; this game received national publicity when it was taken up by Prince Harry.', u"Aided by AstroTurf facilities on Masters' field, field hockey has become a major Lent Half sport along with Rugby 7's.", u"Elite rowers prepare for the Schools' Head of the River Race in late March.", u'During the Summer Half, sporting boys divide into dry bobs, who play cricket, tennis or athletics, and wet bobs, who row on the River Thames and the rowing lake in preparation for The National Schools Regatta and the Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta.', u'The rowing lake at Dorney was developed and is owned by the College.', u'It was the venue for the rowing and canoeing events at the 2012 Summer Olympics and the World Junior Rowing Championships.', u"The annual cricket match against Harrow at Lord's Cricket Ground is the oldest fixture of the cricketing calendar, having been played there since 1805.", u"A staple of the London society calendar since the 1800s, in 1914, its importance was such that over 38,000 people attended the two days' play, and in 1910 the match made national headlines.", u'But interest has since declined considerably, and the match is now a one-day limited overs contest.', u'There is a running track at the Thames Valley Athletics Centre and an annual steeplechase.', u'Among the other sports played at Eton is Eton Fives.', u'In 1815, Eton College documented its football rules, the first football code to be written down anywhere in the world.', u'== Music and drama ==\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe current "Precentor" (Head of Music) is Tim Johnson, and the School boasts eight organs and an entire building for music (performance spaces include the School Hall, the Farrer Theatre and two halls dedicated to music, the Parry Hall and the Concert Hall).', u'Many instruments are taught, including obscure ones such as the didgeridoo.', u'The School participates in many national competitions; many pupils are part of the National Youth Orchestra, and the School gives scholarships for dedicated and talented musicians.', u'A former Precentor of the college, Ralph Allwood set up and organised Eton Choral Courses, which run at the School every summer.', u"In 2009, the School's musical prot\xe9g\xe9s came to wider notice when featured in a TV documentary A Boy Called Alex.", u'The film followed an Etonian, Alex Stobbs, a musician with cystic fibrosis, as he worked toward conducting the difficult Magnificat by Johann Sebastian Bach.', u'=== Drama ===\n\nNumerous plays are put on every year at Eton College; there is one main theatre, called the Farrer (seating 400) and 2 Studio theatres, called the Caccia Studio and Empty Space (seating 90 and 80 respectively).', u'There are about 8 or 9 house productions each year, around 3 or 4 "independent" plays (not confined solely to one house, produced, directed and funded by Etonians) and three school plays, one specifically for boys in the first two years, and two open to all years.', u'The School Plays have such good reputations that they are normally fully booked every night.', u'Productions also take place in varying locations around the School, varying from the sports fields to more historic buildings such as Upper School and College Chapel.', u"In recent years, the School has put on a musical version of The Bacchae (October 2009) as well as productions of A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (May 2010), The Cherry Orchard (February 2011), Joseph K (October 2011), Cyrano de Bergerac (May 2012), Macbeth (October 2012), London Assurance (May 2013), Jerusalem (October 2013), and A Midsummer Night's Dream (May 2014).", u"Often girls from surrounding schools, such as St George's, Ascot, St Mary's School Ascot, Windsor Girls' School and Heathfield St Mary's School, are cast in female roles.", u'Boys from the School are also responsible for the lighting, sound and stage management of all the productions, under the guidance of several professional full-time theatre staff.', u"Every year, Eton employs a 'Director-in-Residence', an external professional director on a one-year contract who normally directs one house play and the Lower Boy play (a school play open solely to the first two-year groups), as well as teaching Drama and Theatre Studies to most year groups.", u'The drama department is headed by Hailz-Emily Osborne and several other teachers; Simon Dormandy was on the staff until late 2012.', u'The School offers GCSE drama as well as A-level "English with Theatre Studies."', u'== Celebrations ==\nEton\'s best-known holiday takes place on the so-called "Fourth of June", a celebration of the birthday of King George III, Eton\'s greatest patron.', u'This day is celebrated with the Procession of Boats, in which the top rowing crews from the top four years row past in vintage wooden rowing boats.', u'Similar to the Queen\'s Official Birthday, the "Fourth of June" is no longer celebrated on 4 June, but on the Wednesday before the first weekend of June.', u"Eton also observes St. Andrew's Day, on which the Eton wall game is played.", u'== School magazines ==\nThe Junior Chronicle and The Chronicle are the official School magazines, the latter having been founded in 1863.', u'Both are edited by boys at the School.', u'Although liable to censorship, the latter has a tradition of satirising and attacking School policies, as well as documenting recent events.', u'The Oppidan, founded in 1828, was published once a Half; it covered all sport in Eton and some professional events as well, but no longer exists.', u'Other School magazines, including The Spectrum (the Academic Yearbook), The Arts Review, and The Eton Zeitgeist have been published, as well as publications produced by individual departments such as The Cave (Philosophy), Etonomics (Economics), Scientific Etonian (Science), Timeline (History), Praed (Poetry and Song), The Mayflower (English), and The Lexicon (Modern Languages).', u'== Charitable status and fees ==\nUntil 18 December 2010, Eton College was an exempt charity under English law (Charities Act 1993, Schedule 2).', u'Under the provisions of the Charities Act 2006, it is now an excepted charity, and fully registered with the Charities Commission, and is now one of the 100 largest charities in the UK.', u'As a charity, it benefits from substantial tax breaks.', u'It was calculated by the late David Jewell, former Master of Haileybury, that in 1992 such tax breaks saved the School about \xa31,945 per pupil per year, although he had no direct connection with the School.', u'This subsidy has declined since the 2001 abolition by the Labour Government of state-funded scholarships (formerly known as "assisted places") to independent schools.', u'However, no child attended Eton on this scheme, meaning that the actual level of state assistance to the School has always been lower.', u"Eton's retiring Head Master, Tony Little, has claimed that the benefits that Eton provides to the local community free of charge (use of its facilities, etc.)", u'have a higher value than the tax breaks it receives as a result of its charitable status.', u'The fee for the academic year 2010\u20132011 was \xa329,862 (approximately US$48,600 or \u20ac35,100 as of March 2011), although the sum is considerably lower for those pupils on bursaries and scholarships.', u"== Controversy ==\n\n\n=== Lottery grant (1995) ===\nIn 1995 the National Lottery granted money for a \xa34.6m sports complex, to add to Eton's existing facilities of two swimming pools, 30 cricket squares, 24 football, rugby and hockey pitches and a gym.", u'The College paid \xa3200,000 and contributed 4.5 hectares of land in return for exclusive use of the facilities during the daytime only.', u'The UK Sports Council defended the deal on the grounds that the whole community would benefit, while the bursar claimed that Windsor, Slough and Eton Athletic Club was "deprived" because local people (who were not pupils at the College) did not have a world-class running track and facilities to train with.', u'Steve Osborn, director of the Safe Neighbourhoods Unit, described the decision as "staggering" given the background of a substantial reduction in youth services by councils across the country, a matter over which, however, neither the College nor the UK Sports Council, had any control.', u'The facility, which became the Thames Valley Athletics Centre, opened in April 1999.', u'=== Unfair dismissal of an art teacher (2004) ===\nIn October 2004, Sarah Forsyth claimed that she had been dismissed unfairly by Eton College and had been bullied by senior staff.', u"She also claimed she was instructed to do some of Prince Harry's coursework to enable him to pass AS Art.", u'As evidence, Forsyth provided secretly recorded conversations with both Prince Harry and her Head of Department, Ian Burke.', u'An employment tribunal in July 2005 found that she had been unfairly dismissed and criticised Burke for bullying her and for repeatedly changing his story.', u'It also criticised the school for failing to produce its capability procedures and criticised the Head Master for not reviewing the case independently.', u'It criticised Forsyth\'s decision to record a conversation with Harry as an abuse of teacher\u2013student confidentiality and said "It is clear whichever version of the evidence is accepted that Mr Burke did ask the claimant to assist Prince Harry with text for his expressive art project.', u'...', u'It is not part of this tribunal\'s function to determine whether or not it was legitimate."', u'In response to the tribunal\'s ruling concerning the allegations about Prince Harry, the School issued a statement, saying Forsyth\'s claims "were dismissed for what they always have been\u2014unfounded and irrelevant."', u'A spokesperson from Clarence House said, "We are delighted that Harry has been totally cleared of cheating."', u'=== School fees cartel (2005) ===\n\nIn 2005, the Office of Fair Trading found fifty independent schools, including Eton, to have breached the Competition Act by "regularly and systematically" exchanging information about planned increases in school fees, which was collated and distributed among the schools by the bursar at Sevenoaks School.', u'Following the investigation by the OFT, each school was required to pay around \xa370,000, totalling around \xa33.5 million, significantly less than the maximum possible fine.', u'In addition, the schools together agreed to contribute another \xa33m to a new charitable educational fund.', u'The incident raised concerns over whether the charitable status of independent schools such as Eton should be reconsidered, and perhaps revoked.', u'However, Jean Scott, the head of the Independent Schools Council, said the schools were following a long-established procedure in sharing the information with each other because independent schools were previously exempt from anti-cartel rules applied to business and that they were unaware of the change to the law (on which they had not been consulted).', u'She wrote to John Vickers, the OFT director-general, saying, "They are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer.', u'They are schools that have quite openly continued to follow a long-established practice because they were unaware that the law had changed."', u'=== Farming subsidies (2005) ===\nA Freedom of Information request in 2005 revealed that Eton had received \xa32,652 in farming subsidies in 2004 under the Common Agricultural Policy.', u"Asked to explain under what grounds it was eligible to receive farming subsidies, Eton admitted that it was 'a bit of a mystery'.", u"Panorama revealed in March 2012 that farming subsidies were granted to Eton for 'environmental improvements', in effect 'being paid without having to do any farming at all'.", u"=== University admissions (2010, 2011) ===\nFigures obtained by The Daily Telegraph had revealed that, in 2010, 37 applicants from Eton were accepted by Oxford whilst state schools had difficulty obtaining entry even for pupils with the country's most impressive exam results.", u'According to The Economist, Oxford and Cambridge admit more Etonians each year than applicants from the whole country who qualify for free school meals.', u"In April 2011 the Labour MP David Lammy described as unfair and 'indefensible' the fact that Oxford University had organised nine 'outreach events' at Eton in 2010, although he admitted that it had, in fact, held fewer such events for Eton than for another independent school, Wellington College.", u'=== Scholarship exam question about killing protesters (2011) ===\nIn May 2013, Eton College was criticised in several editorials for asking potential 2011 scholarship students how, if they were Prime Minister, they might defend the use of lethal force by the Army after two days of violent protests in which several policemen have been killed.', u'=== Mistaken acceptance emails (2015) ===\nIn July 2015, Eton accidentally sent emails to 400 prospective students, offering them conditional entrance to the school in September 2017.', u"The email was intended for nine students, but an IT glitch caused the email to be sent to 400 additional families, who didn't necessarily have a place.", u'In response, the school issued the following statement: "This error was discovered within minutes and each family was immediately contacted to notify them that it should be disregarded and to apologise.', u'We take this type of incident very seriously indeed and so a thorough investigation, overseen by the headmaster Tony Little and led by the tutor for admissions, is being carried out to find out exactly what went wrong and ensure it cannot happen again.', u'Eton College offers its sincere apologies to those boys concerned and their families.', u'We deeply regret the confusion and upset this must have caused."', u'== Historical relations with other schools ==\nEton College has links with some private schools in India today, maintained from the days of the British Raj, such as The Doon School and Mayo College.', u"Eton College is also a member of the G20 Schools Group, a collection of college preparatory boarding schools from around the world, including Turkey's Robert College, the United States' Phillips Academy and Phillips Exeter Academy, Australia's Scotch College, Melbourne Grammar School and Launceston Church Grammar School, Singapore's Raffles Institution, and Switzerland's International School of Geneva.", u'Eton has recently fostered a relationship with the Roxbury Latin School, a traditional all-boys private school in Boston, US.', u'Former Eton headmaster and provost Sir Eric Anderson shares a close friendship with Roxbury Latin Headmaster emeritus F. Washington Jarvis; Anderson has visited Roxbury Latin on numerous occasions, while Jarvis briefly taught theology at Eton after retiring from his headmaster post at Roxbury Latin.', u"The headmasters' close friendship spawned the Hennessy Scholarship, an annual prize established in 2005 and awarded to a graduating RL senior for a year of study at Eton.", u'Hennessy Scholars generally reside in Wotton house.', u"=== The Doon School, India ===\nThe Doon School, founded in 1935, was the first all-boys' public school in India modelled along the lines of Eton.", u"The School's first headmaster was an Englishman, Arthur E.

Edgar Hoover as director ===\n\nJ. Edgar Hoover served as Director from 1924 to 1972, a combined 48 years with the BOI, DOI, and FBI.', u'He was chiefly responsible for creating the Scientific Crime Detection Laboratory, or the FBI Laboratory, which officially opened in 1932, as part of his work to professionalize investigations by the government.', u'Hoover was substantially involved in most major cases and projects that the FBI handled during his tenure.', u"After Hoover's death, Congress passed legislation that limited the tenure of future FBI Directors to ten years.", u'During the "War on Crime" of the 1930s, FBI agents apprehended or killed a number of notorious criminals who carried out kidnappings, robberies, and murders throughout the nation, including John Dillinger, "Baby Face" Nelson, Kate "Ma" Barker, Alvin "Creepy" Karpis, and George "Machine Gun" Kelly.', u'Other activities of its early decades included a decisive role in reducing the scope and influence of the Ku Klux Klan.', u'Additionally, through the work of Edwin Atherton, the FBI claimed success in apprehending an entire army of Mexican neo-revolutionaries along the California border in the 1920s.', u'Hoover began using wiretapping in the 1920s during Prohibition to arrest bootleggers.', u"In the 1927 case Olmstead v. United States, in which a bootlegger was caught through telephone tapping, the United States Supreme Court ruled that FBI wiretaps did not violate the Fourth Amendment as unlawful search and seizure, as long as the FBI did not break into a person's home to complete the tapping.", u"After Prohibition's repeal, Congress passed the Communications Act of 1934, which outlawed non-consensual phone tapping, but allowed bugging.", u'In the 1939 case Nardone v. United States, the court ruled that due to the 1934 law, evidence the FBI obtained by phone tapping was inadmissible in court.', u'After the 1967 case Katz v. United States overturned the 1927 case that had allowed bugging, Congress passed the Omnibus Crime Control Act, allowing public authorities to tap telephones during investigations as long as they obtain a warrant beforehand.', u'==== National security ====\nBeginning in the 1940s and continuing into the 1970s, the bureau investigated cases of espionage against the United States and its allies.', u'Eight Nazi agents who had planned sabotage operations against American targets were arrested, and six were executed (Ex parte Quirin) under their sentences.', u'Also during this time, a joint US/UK code-breaking effort (the Venona project)\u2014with which the FBI was heavily involved\u2014broke Soviet diplomatic and intelligence communications codes, allowing the US and British governments to read Soviet communications.', u'This effort confirmed the existence of Americans working in the United States for Soviet intelligence.', u'Hoover was administering this project but failed to notify the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) until 1952.', u'Another notable case is the arrest of Soviet spy Rudolf Abel in 1957.', u'The discovery of Soviet spies operating in the US allowed Hoover to pursue his longstanding obsession with the threat he perceived from the American Left, ranging from Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA) union organizers to American liberals.', u'==== Japanese American internment ====\nIn 1939, the Bureau began compiling a custodial detention list with the names of those who would be taken into custody in the event of war with Axis nations.', u'The majority of the names on the list belonged to Issei community leaders, as the FBI investigation built on an existing Naval Intelligence index that had focused on Japanese Americans in Hawaii and the West Coast, but many German and Italian nationals also found their way onto the secret list.', u'Robert Shivers, head of the Honolulu office, obtained permission from Hoover to start detaining those on the list on December 7, 1941, while bombs were still falling over Pearl Harbor.', u'Mass arrests and searches of homes (in most cases conducted without warrants) began a few hours after the attack, and over the next several weeks more than 5,500 Issei men were taken into FBI custody.', u'On February 19, 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, authorizing the removal of Japanese Americans from the West Coast.', u'FBI Director Hoover opposed the subsequent mass removal and confinement of Japanese Americans authorized under Executive Order 9066, but Roosevelt prevailed.', u'The vast majority went along with the subsequent exclusion orders, but in a handful of cases where Japanese Americans refused to obey the new military regulations, FBI agents handled their arrests.', u'The Bureau continued surveillance on Japanese Americans throughout the war, conducting background checks on applicants for resettlement outside camp, and entering the camps (usually without the permission of War Relocation Authority officials) and grooming informants in order to monitor dissidents and "troublemakers."', u'After the war, the FBI was assigned to protect returning Japanese Americans from attacks by hostile white communities.', u'==== Civil Rights Movement ====\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, FBI officials became increasingly concerned about the influence of civil rights leaders, whom they believed had communist ties or were unduly influenced by them.', u'In 1956, for example, Hoover sent an open letter denouncing Dr. T.R.M.', u'Howard, a civil rights leader, surgeon, and wealthy entrepreneur in Mississippi who had criticized FBI inaction in solving recent murders of George W. Lee, Emmett Till, and other blacks in the South.', u'The FBI carried out controversial domestic surveillance in an operation it called the COINTELPRO, a portmanteau derived from "COunter-INTELligence PROgram."', u'It was to investigate and disrupt the activities of dissident political organizations within the United States, including both militant and non-violent organizations.', u'Among its targets was the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, a leading civil rights organization with clergy leadership.', u'The FBI frequently investigated Martin Luther King, Jr.', u'In the mid-1960s, King began publicly criticizing the Bureau for giving insufficient attention to the use of terrorism by white supremacists.', u'Hoover responded by publicly calling King the most "notorious liar" in the United States.', u'In his 1991 memoir, Washington Post journalist Carl Rowan asserted that the FBI had sent at least one anonymous letter to King encouraging him to commit suicide.', u'Historian Taylor Branch documents an anonymous November 1964 "suicide package" sent by the Bureau that combined a letter to the civil rights leader telling him "You are done.', u'There is only one way out for you..." with audio recordings of King\'s sexual indiscretions.', u"In March 1971, the residential office of an FBI agent in Media, Pennsylvania was burglarized by a group calling itself the Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI.", u'Numerous files were taken and distributed to a range of newspapers, including The Harvard Crimson.', u"The files detailed the FBI's extensive COINTELPRO program, which included investigations into lives of ordinary citizens\u2014including a black student group at a Pennsylvania military college and the daughter of Congressman Henry Reuss of Wisconsin.", u'The country was "jolted" by the revelations, which included assassinations of political activists, and the actions were denounced by members of Congress, including House Majority Leader Hale Boggs.', u'The phones of some members of Congress, including Boggs, had allegedly been tapped.', u"==== Kennedy's assassination ====\nWhen President John F. Kennedy was shot and killed, the jurisdiction fell to the local police departments until President Lyndon B. Johnson directed the FBI to take over the investigation.", u'To ensure clarity about responsibility for investigation of homicides of federal officials, Congress passed a law that put investigations of deaths of federal officials within FBI jurisdiction.', u'This new law was passed in 1965.', u'=== Organized crime ===\nIn response to organized crime, on August 25, 1953, the FBI created the Top Hoodlum Program.', u'The national office directed field offices to gather information on mobsters in their territories and to report it regularly to Washington for a centralized collection of intelligence on racketeers.', u'After the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO Act, took effect, the FBI began investigating the former Prohibition-organized groups, which had become fronts for crime in major cities and small towns.', u'All of the FBI work was done undercover and from within these organizations, using the provisions provided in the RICO Act.', u'Gradually the agency dismantled many of the groups.', u'Although Hoover initially denied the existence of a National Crime Syndicate in the United States, the Bureau later conducted operations against known organized crime syndicates and families, including those headed by Sam Giancana and John Gotti.', u'The RICO Act is still used today for all organized crime and any individuals who might fall under the Act.', u'In 2003 a congressional committee called the FBI\'s organized crime informant program "one of the greatest failures in the history of federal law enforcement."', u'The FBI allowed four innocent men to be convicted of the March 1965 gangland murder of Edward "Teddy" Deegan in order to protect Vincent Flemmi, an FBI informant.', u'Three of the men were sentenced to death (which was later reduced to life in prison), and the fourth defendant was sentenced to life in prison.', u'Two of the four men died in prison after serving almost 30 years, and two others were released after serving 32 and 36 years.', u'In July 2007, U.S. District Judge Nancy Gertner in Boston found the bureau helped convict the four men using false witness account by mobster Joseph Barboza.', u'The U.S. Government was ordered to pay $100 million in damages to the four defendants.', u'=== Special FBI teams ===\n\nIn 1982, the FBI formed an elite unit to help with problems that might arise at the 1984 Summer Olympics to be held in Los Angeles, particularly terrorism and major-crime.', u'This was a result of the 1972 Summer Olympics at Munich, Germany, when terrorists murdered the Israeli athletes.', u'Named Hostage Rescue Team (HRT), it acts as the FBI lead for a national SWAT team in related procedures and all counter-terrorism cases.', u'Also formed in 1984 was the Computer Analysis and Response Team (CART).', u'From the end of the 1980s to the early 1990s, the FBI reassigned more than 300 agents from foreign counter-intelligence duties to violent crime, and made violent crime the sixth national priority.', u'With reduced cuts to other well-established departments, and because terrorism was no longer considered a threat after the end of the Cold War, the FBI assisted local and state police forces in tracking fugitives who had crossed state lines, which is a federal offense.', u'The FBI Laboratory helped develop DNA testing, continuing its pioneering role in identification that began with its fingerprinting system in 1924.', u'=== Notable efforts in the 1990s ===\n\nBetween 1993 and 1996, the FBI increased its counter-terrorism role in the wake of the first 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York City, New York; the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and the arrest of the Unabomber in 1996.', u'Technological innovation and the skills of FBI Laboratory analysts helped ensure that the three cases were successfully prosecuted.', u"Justice Department investigations into the FBI's roles in the Ruby Ridge and Waco incidents were found to be obstructed by agents within the Bureau.", u'During the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, the FBI was criticized for its investigation of the Centennial Olympic Park bombing.', u'It has settled a dispute with Richard Jewell, who was a private security guard at the venue, along with some media organizations, in regard to the leaking of his name during the investigation.', u'After Congress passed the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA, 1994), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA, 1996), and the Economic Espionage Act (EEA, 1996), the FBI followed suit and underwent a technological upgrade in 1998, just as it did with its CART team in 1991.', u'Computer Investigations and Infrastructure Threat Assessment Center (CITAC) and the National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) were created to deal with the increase in Internet-related problems, such as computer viruses, worms, and other malicious programs that threatened US operations.', u'With these developments, the FBI increased its electronic surveillance in public safety and national security investigations, adapting to the telecommunications advancements that changed the nature of such problems.', u'=== September 11 attacks ===\nDuring the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center, FBI agent Leonard W. Hatton Jr. was killed during the rescue effort while helping the rescue personnel evacuate the occupants of the South Tower and stayed when it collapsed.', u'Within months after the attacks, FBI Director Robert Mueller, who had been sworn in a week before the attacks, called for a re-engineering of FBI structure and operations.', u'He made countering every federal crime a top priority, including the prevention of terrorism, countering foreign intelligence operations, addressing cyber security threats, other high-tech crimes, protecting civil rights, combating public corruption, organized crime, white-collar crime, and major acts of violent crime.', u'In February 2001, Robert Hanssen was caught selling information to the Russian government.', u'It was later learned that Hanssen, who had reached a high position within the FBI, had been selling intelligence since as early as 1979.', u'He pleaded guilty to treason and received a life sentence in 2002, but the incident led many to question the security practices employed by the FBI.', u'There was also a claim that Robert Hanssen might have contributed information that led to the September 11, 2001, attacks.', u"The 9/11 Commission's final report on July 22, 2004, stated that the FBI and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) were both partially to blame for not pursuing intelligence reports that could have prevented the September 11, 2001, attacks.", u'In its most damning assessment, the report concluded that the country had "not been well served" by either agency and listed numerous recommendations for changes within the FBI.', u'While the FBI has acceded to most of the recommendations, including oversight by the new Director of National Intelligence, some former members of the 9/11 Commission publicly criticized the FBI in October 2005, claiming it was resisting any meaningful changes.', u"On July 8, 2007, The Washington Post published excerpts from UCLA Professor Amy Zegart's book Spying Blind: The CIA, the FBI, and the Origins of 9/11.", u"The Post reported from Zegart's book that government documents show the CIA and FBI missed 23 potential chances to disrupt the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.", u'The primary reasons for the failures included: agency cultures resistant to change and new ideas; inappropriate incentives for promotion; and a lack of cooperation between the FBI, CIA and the rest of the United States Intelligence Community.', u"The book blamed the FBI's decentralized structure, which prevented effective communication and cooperation among different FBI offices.", u'The book suggested that the FBI has not evolved into an effective counter-terrorism or counter-intelligence agency, due in large part to deeply ingrained agency cultural resistance to change.', u"For example, FBI personnel practices continue to treat all staff other than special agents as support staff, classifying intelligence analysts alongside the FBI's auto mechanics and janitors.", u'=== Faulty bullet analysis ===\nFor over 40 years, the FBI crime lab in Quantico believed lead in bullets had unique chemical signatures.', u'It analyzed the bullets with the goal of matching them chemically, not only to a single batch of ammunition coming out of a factory, but also to a single box of bullets.', u'The National Academy of Sciences conducted an 18-month independent review of comparative bullet-lead analysis.', u'In 2003, its National Research Council published a report whose conclusions called into question 30 years of FBI testimony.', u'It found the analytic model used by the FBI for interpreting results was deeply flawed, and the conclusion, that bullet fragments could be matched to a box of ammunition, was so overstated that it was misleading under the rules of evidence.', u'One year later, the FBI decided to stop doing bullet lead analysis.', u'After a 60 Minutes/Washington Post investigation in November 2007 (two years later), the bureau agreed to identify, review, and release all pertinent cases, and notify prosecutors about cases in which faulty testimony was given.', u'== Organization ==\n\n\n=== Organizational structure ===\n\nThe FBI is organized into functional branches and the Office of the Director, which contains most administrative offices.', u'An executive assistant director manages each branch.', u'Each branch is then divided into offices and divisions, each headed by an assistant director.', u'The various divisions are further divided into sub-branches, led by deputy assistant directors.', u'Within these sub-branches there are various sections headed by section chiefs.', u'Section chiefs are ranked analogous to special agents in charge.', u'Four of the branches report to the deputy director while two report to the associate director.', u'The functions branches of the FBI are:\nFBI Intelligence Branch\nFBI National Security Branch\nFBI Criminal, Cyber, Response, and Services Branch\nFBI Science and Technology Branch\nFBI Information and Technology Branch\nFBI Human Resources Branch\nThe Office of the Director serves as the central administrative organ of the FBI.', u'The office provide staff support functions (such as finance and facilities management) to the five function branches and the various field divisions.', u'The office is managed by the FBI associate director, who also oversees the operations of both the Information and Technology and Human Resources Branches.', u'Office of the Director\nImmediate Office of the Director\nOffice of the Deputy Director\nOffice of the Associate

authority ==\n\nThe FBI\'s mandate is established in Title 28 of the United States Code (U.S. Code), Section 533, which authorizes the Attorney General to "appoint officials to detect and prosecute crimes against the United States."', u'Other federal statutes give the FBI the authority and responsibility to investigate specific crimes.', u"The FBI's chief tool against organized crime is the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act.", u'The FBI is also charged with the responsibility of enforcing compliance of the United States Civil Rights Act of 1964 and investigating violations of the act in addition to prosecuting such violations with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ).', u'The FBI also shares concurrent jurisdiction with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in the enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.', u'The USA PATRIOT Act increased the powers allotted to the FBI, especially in wiretapping and monitoring of Internet activity.', u'One of the most controversial provisions of the act is the so-called sneak and peek provision, granting the FBI powers to search a house while the residents are away, and not requiring them to notify the residents for several weeks afterwards.', u"Under the PATRIOT Act's provisions, the FBI also resumed inquiring into the library records of those who are suspected of terrorism (something it had supposedly not done since the 1970s).", u'In the early 1980s, Senate hearings were held to examine FBI undercover operations in the wake of the Abscam controversy, which had allegations of entrapment of elected officials.', u'As a result, in following years a number of guidelines were issued to constrain FBI activities.', u'A March 2007 report by the inspector general of the Justice Department described the FBI\'s "widespread and serious misuse" of national security letters, a form of administrative subpoena used to demand records and data pertaining to individuals.', u'The report said that between 2003 and 2005, the FBI had issued more than 140,000 national security letters, many involving people with no obvious connections to terrorism.', u'Information obtained through an FBI investigation is presented to the appropriate U.S. Attorney or Department of Justice official, who decides if prosecution or other action is warranted.', u'The FBI often works in conjunction with other Federal agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in seaport and airport security, and the National Transportation Safety Board in investigating airplane crashes and other critical incidents.', u'Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations (ICE-HSI) has nearly the same amount of investigative manpower as the FBI, and investigates the largest range of crimes.', u'In the wake of the September 11 attacks, then-Attorney General Ashcroft assigned the FBI as the designated lead organization in terrorism investigations after the creation of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.', u'ICE-HSI and the FBI are both integral members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force.', u'=== Indian reservations ===\nThe federal government has the primary responsibility for investigating and prosecuting serious crime on Indian reservations.', u'The FBI does not specifically list crimes in Native American land as one of its priorities.', u'Often serious crimes have been either poorly investigated or prosecution has been declined.', u'Tribal courts can impose sentences of up to three years, under certain restrictions.', u'== Infrastructure ==\n\nThe FBI is headquartered at the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington, D.C., with 56 field offices in major cities across the United States.', u'The FBI also maintains over 400 resident agencies across the United States, as well as over 50 legal attach\xe9s at United States embassies and consulates.', u'Many specialized FBI functions are located at facilities in Quantico, Virginia, as well as a "data campus" in Clarksburg, West Virginia, where 96 million sets of fingerprints "from across the United States are stored, along with others collected by American authorities from prisoners in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, Iraq and Afghanistan."', u'The FBI is in process of moving its Records Management Division, which processes Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, to Winchester, Virginia.', u'According to The Washington Post, the FBI "is building a vast repository controlled by people who work in a top-secret vault on the fourth floor of the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington.', u'This one stores the profiles of tens of thousands of Americans and legal residents who are not accused of any crime.', u'What they have done is appear to be acting suspiciously to a town sheriff, a traffic cop or even a neighbor."', u'The FBI Laboratory, established with the formation of the BOI, did not appear in the J. Edgar Hoover Building until its completion in 1974.', u'The lab serves as the primary lab for most DNA, biological, and physical work.', u'Public tours of FBI headquarters ran through the FBI laboratory workspace before the move to the J. Edgar Hoover Building.', u'The services the lab conducts include Chemistry, Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), Computer Analysis and Response, DNA Analysis, Evidence Response, Explosives, Firearms and Tool marks, Forensic Audio, Forensic Video, Image Analysis, Forensic Science Research, Forensic Science Training, Hazardous Materials Response, Investigative and Prospective Graphics, Latent Prints, Materials Analysis, Questioned Documents, Racketeering Records, Special Photographic Analysis, Structural Design, and Trace Evidence.', u'The services of the FBI Laboratory are used by many state, local, and international agencies free of charge.', u'The lab also maintains a second lab at the FBI Academy.', u'The FBI Academy, located in Quantico, Virginia, is home to the communications and computer laboratory the FBI utilizes.', u'It is also where new agents are sent for training to become FBI Special Agents.', u'Going through the 21-week course is required for every Special Agent.', u'First opened for use in 1972, the facility located on 385 acres (1.6 km2) of woodland.', u'The Academy trains state and local law enforcement agencies, which are invited to the law enforcement training center.', u'The FBI units that reside at Quantico are the Field and Police Training Unit, Firearms Training Unit, Forensic Science Research and Training Center, Technology Services Unit (TSU), Investigative Training Unit, Law Enforcement Communication Unit, Leadership and Management Science Units (LSMU), Physical Training Unit, New Agents\' Training Unit (NATU), Practical Applications Unit (PAU), the Investigative Computer Training Unit and the "College of Analytical Studies."', u'In 2000, the FBI began the Trilogy project to upgrade its outdated information technology (IT) infrastructure.', u'This project, originally scheduled to take three years and cost around $380 million, ended up going far over budget and behind schedule.', u'Efforts to deploy modern computers and networking equipment were generally successful, but attempts to develop new investigation software, outsourced to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), were not.', u'Virtual Case File, or VCF, as the software was known, was plagued by poorly defined goals, and repeated changes in management.', u'In January 2005, more than two years after the software was originally planned for completion, the FBI officially abandoned the project.', u'At least $100 million (and much more by some estimates) was spent on the project, which never became operational.', u'The FBI has been forced to continue using its decade-old Automated Case Support system, which IT experts consider woefully inadequate.', u'In March 2005, the FBI announced it was beginning a new, more ambitious software project, code-named Sentinel, which they expected to complete by 2009.', u'Carnivore was an electronic eavesdropping software system implemented by the FBI during the Clinton administration; it was designed to monitor email and electronic communications.', u'After prolonged negative coverage in the press, the FBI changed the name of its system from "Carnivore" to "DCS1000."', u'DCS is reported to stand for "Digital Collection System"; the system has the same functions as before.', u'The Associated Press reported in mid-January 2005 that the FBI essentially abandoned the use of Carnivore in 2001, in favor of commercially available software, such as NarusInsight.', u'The Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division, is located in Clarksburg, West Virginia.', u'Organized beginning in 1991, the office opened in 1995 as the youngest agency division.', u'The complex is the length of three football fields.', u'It provides a main repository for information in various data systems.', u'Under the roof of the CJIS are the programs for the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR), Fingerprint Identification, Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), NCIC 2000, and the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS).', u'Many state and local agencies use these data systems as a source for their own investigations and contribute to the database using secure communications.', u'FBI provides these tools of sophisticated identification and information services to local, state, federal, and international law enforcement agencies.', u'FBI is in charge of National Virtual Translation Center, which provides "timely and accurate translations of foreign intelligence for all elements of the Intelligence Community."', u'== Personnel ==\n\nAs of December 31, 2009, the FBI had a total of 33,852 employees.', u'That includes 13,412 special agents and 20,420 support professionals, such as intelligence analysts, language specialists, scientists, information technology specialists, and other professionals.', u'The Officer Down Memorial Page provides the biographies of 58 FBI agents killed in the line of duty from 1925 to 2011.', u'=== Hiring process ===\nThe FBI is near-impenetrable, with applicants intensely scrutinized and assessed over an extended period.', u'To apply to become an FBI agent, one must be between the ages of 23 and 37.', u'Due to the decision in Robert P. Isabella v. Department of State and Office of Personnel Management, 2008 M.S.P.B.', u'146, preference-eligible veterans may apply after age 37.', u'In 2009, the Office of Personnel Management issued implementation guidance on the Isabella decision.', u"The applicant must also hold American citizenship, be of high moral character, have a clean record, and hold at least a four-year bachelor's degree.", u'At least three years of professional work experience prior to application is also required.', u'All FBI employees require a Top Secret (TS) security clearance, and in many instances, employees need a TS/SCI (Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information) clearance.', u'To obtain a security clearance, all potential FBI personnel must pass a series of Single Scope Background Investigations (SSBI), which are conducted by the Office of Personnel Management.', u'Special Agents candidates also have to pass a Physical Fitness Test (PFT), which includes a 300-meter run, one-minute sit-ups, maximum push-ups, and a 1.5-mile (2.4 km) run.', u'Personnel must pass a polygraph test with questions including possible drug use.', u'Applicants who fail polygraphs may not gain employment with the FBI.', u'=== BOI and FBI directors ===\n\nFBI Directors are appointed by the President of the United States.', u'They must be confirmed by the United States Senate and serve a term of office of five years, with a maximum of ten years, if reappointed, unless they resign or are fired by the President before their term ends.', u'J. Edgar Hoover, appointed by Calvin Coolidge in 1924, was by far the longest-serving director, serving until his death in 1972.', u'In 1968, Congress passed legislation as part of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act Pub.L.', u'90\u2013351, June 19, 1968, 82 Stat.', u'197 that specified a 10-year limit, a maximum of two 5-year terms, for future FBI Directors, as well as requiring Senate confirmation of appointees.', u'As the incumbent, this legislation did not apply to Hoover, only to his successors.', u'The current FBI Director is James B. Comey, who was appointed in 2013 by Barack Obama.', u'The FBI director is responsible for the day-to-day operations at the FBI.', u'Along with his deputies, the director makes sure cases and operations are handled correctly.', u'The director also is in charge of making sure the leadership in any one of the FBI field offices is manned with qualified agents.', u'Before the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act was passed in the wake of the September 11 attacks, the FBI director would directly brief the President of the United States on any issues that arise from within the FBI.', u'Since then, the director now reports to the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), who in turn reports to the President.', u'== Weapons ==\n\nAn FBI special agent is issued a Glock Model 22 pistol or a Glock 23 in .40 S&W caliber.', u'If they fail their first qualification, they are issued either a Glock 17 or Glock 19, to aid in their next qualification.', u'In May 1997, the FBI officially adopted the Glock .40 S&W pistol for general agent use and first issued it to New Agent Class 98-1 in October 1997.', u'At present, the Model 23 "FG&R" (finger groove and rail) is the issue sidearm.', u'New agents are issued firearms, on which they must qualify, on successful completion of their training at the FBI Academy.', u'The Glock 26 in 9\xd719mm Parabellum, and Glock Models 23 and 27 in .40 S&W caliber are authorized as secondary weapons.', u'Special agents are authorized to purchase and qualify with the Glock Model 21 in .45 ACP.', u'Special agents of the FBI HRT (Hostage Rescue Team), and regional SWAT teams are issued the Springfield Professional Model 1911A1 .45 ACP pistol (see FBI Special Weapons and Tactics Teams).', u'== Publications ==\nThe FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin is published monthly by the FBI Law Enforcement Communication Unit, with articles of interest to state and local law enforcement personnel.', u'First published in 1932 as Fugitives Wanted by Police, the FBI Law Bulletin covers topics including law enforcement technology and issues, such as crime mapping and use of force, as well as recent criminal justice research, and Vi-CAP alerts, on wanted suspects and key cases.', u'The FBI also publishes some reports for both law enforcement personnel as well as regular citizens covering topics including law enforcement, terrorism, cybercrime, white-collar crime, violent crime, and statistics.', u'However, the vast majority of federal government publications covering these topics are published by the Office of Justice Programs agencies of the United States Department of Justice, and disseminated through the National Criminal Justice Reference Service.', u'=== Crime statistics ===\nIn the 1920s, the FBI began issuing crime reports by gathering numbers from local police departments.', u'Due to limitations of this system found during the 1960s and 1970s\u2014victims often simply did not report crimes to the police in the first place\u2014the Department of Justice developed an alternate method of tallying crime, the victimization survey.', u'==== Uniform Crime Reports ====\n\nThe Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) compile data from over 17,000 law enforcement agencies across the country.', u'They provide detailed data regarding the volume of crimes to include arrest, clearance (or closing a case), and law enforcement officer information.', u'The UCR focuses its data collection on violent crimes, hate crimes, and property crimes.', u'Created in the 1920s, the UCR system has not proven to be as uniform as its name implies.', u'The UCR data only reflect the most serious offense in the case of connected crimes and has a very restrictive definition of rape.', u'Since about 93% of the data submitted to the FBI is in this format, the UCR stands out as the publication of choice as most states require law enforcement agencies to submit this data.', u'Preliminary Annual Uniform Crime Report for 2006 was released on June 4, 2006.', u'The report shows violent crime offenses rose 1.3%, but the number of property crime offenses decreased 2.9% compared to 2005.', u'==== National Incident Based Reporting System ====\n\nThe National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) crime statistics system aims to address limitations inherent in UCR data.', u'The system is used by law enforcement agencies in the United States for collecting and reporting data on crimes.', u'Local, state, and federal agencies generate NIBRS data from their records management systems.', u'Data is collected on every incident and arrest in the Group A offense category.', u'The Group A offenses are 46 specific crimes grouped in 22 offense categories.', u'Specific facts about these offenses are gathered and reported in the NIBRS system.', u'In addition to the Group A offenses, eleven Group B offenses are reported with only the arrest information.', u'The NIBRS system is in greater detail than the summary-based UCR system.', u'As of 2004, 5,271 law enforcement agencies submitted NIBRS data.', u'That amount represents 20% of the United States population and 16% of the crime statistics data collected by the FBI.', u'== eGuardian ==\neGuardian is the name of an FBI system, launched in January 2009, to share tips about possible terror threats with local police agencies.', u'The program aims to get law enforcement at all levels sharing data quickly about suspicious activity and people.', u'eGuardian enables near real-time sharing and tracking of terror information and suspicious activities with local, state, tribal, and federal agencies.', u'The eGuardian system is a spin-off of a similar but classified tool called Guardian that has been used inside the FBI, and shared with vetted partners since 2005.', u'== Controversies ==\nThroughout its history, the bureau has been the subject of a number of controversial cases, both at home and abroad.', u'=== Files on US citizens ===\nThe FBI has maintained files on numerous people, including celebrities such as Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, John Denver, John Lennon, Jane Fonda, Groucho Marx, Charlie Chaplin, the band MC5, Lou Costello, Sonny Bono, Bob Dylan, Michael Jackson, and Mickey Mantle.', u'The files were collected for various reasons.', u'Some of the subjects were investigated for alleged ties to the Communist party (Charlie Chaplin and Groucho Marx), or in connection with antiwar activities during the Vietnam War (John Denver, John Lennon, and Jane Fonda).', u'Numerous celebrity files concern threats or extortion attempts against them (Sonny Bono, John Denver, John Lennon, Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, Mickey Mantle, Groucho Marx, and Frank Sinatra).', u'=== Covert operations on political groups ===\nCOINTELPRO tactics have been alleged to include discrediting targets through psychological warfare; smearing individuals and groups using forged documents and by planting false reports in the media; harassment; wrongful imprisonment; and illegal violence.', u'The FBI\'s stated motivation was "protecting national security, preventing violence, and maintaining the existing social and political order."', u'FBI records show that 85% of COINTELPRO resources targeted groups and individuals that the FBI deemed "subversive", including communist and socialist organizations; organizations and individuals associated with the Civil Rights Movement, including Martin Luther King, Jr. and others associated with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and the Congress of Racial Equality and other civil rights organizations; black nationalist groups; the American Indian Movement; a broad range of organizations labeled "New Left", including Students for a Democratic Society and the Weathermen; almost all groups protesting the Vietnam War, as well as individual student demonstrators with no group affiliation; the National Lawyers Guild; organizations and individuals associated with the women\'s rights movement; nationalist groups such as those seeking independence for Puerto Rico, United Ireland, and Cuban exile movements including Orlando Bosch\'s Cuban Power and the Cuban Nationalist Movement.', u"The remaining 15% of COINTELPRO resources were expended to marginalize and subvert white hate groups, including the Ku Klux Klan and the National States' Rights Party.", u'=== Files on Puerto Rican independence advocates ===\nThe FBI also spied upon and collected information on Puerto Rican independence leader Pedro Albizu Campos and his Nationalist political party in the 1930s.', u'Abizu Campos was convicted three times in connection with deadly attacks on US government officials: in 1937 (Conspiracy to overthrow the government of the United States), in 1950 (attempted murder), and in 1954 (after an armed assault on the US House of Representatives while in session; although not present, Abizu Campos was considered the mastermind).', u'The FBI operation was covert and did not become known until U.S.', u'Congressman Luis Gutierrez had it made public via the Freedom of Information Act in the 1980s.', u'In the 2000s, researchers got files released by the FBI under the Freedom of Information Act revealing that the San Juan FBI office had coordinated with FBI offices in New York, Chicago and other cities, in a decades-long surveillance of Albizu Campos and Puerto Ricans who had contact or communication with him.', u'The documents available are as recent as 1965.', u'=== Activities in Latin America ===\nFrom the 1950s to the 1980s, the governments of many Latin American and Caribbean countries were infiltrated by the FBI.', u'=== Internal investigations of shootings ===\nDuring the period from 1993 to 2011, FBI agents fired their weapons on 289 occasions; FBI internal reviews found the shots justified in all but 5 cases, in none of the 5 cases were people wounded.', u'Samuel Walker, a professor of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska Omaha said the number of shots found to be unjustified was "suspiciously low."', u'In the same time period, the FBI wounded 150 people, 70 of whom died; the FBI found all 150 shootings to be justified.', u'Likewise, during the period from 2011 to the present, all shootings by FBI agents have been found to be justified by internal investigation.', u"In a 2002 case in Maryland, an innocent man was shot, and later paid $1.3 million by the FBI after agents mistook him for a bank robber; the internal investigation found that the shooting was justified, based on the man's actions.", u'=== The Whitey Bulger case ===\nThe FBI has been criticized for its handling of Boston organized crime figure Whitey Bulger.', u'Beginning in 1975, Bulger served as an informant for the FBI.', u'As a result, the Bureau largely ignored his organization in exchange for information about the inner workings of the Italian American Patriarca crime family.', u'In December 1994, after being tipped off by his former FBI handler about a pending indictment under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, Bulger fled Boston and went into hiding.', u'For 16 years, he remained at large.', u'For 12 of those years, Bulger was prominently listed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list.', u'Beginning in 1997, the New England media exposed criminal actions by federal, state, and local law enforcement officials tied to Bulger.', u'The revelation caused great embarrassment to the FBI.', u'In 2002, Special Agent John J Connolly was convicted of federal racketeering charges for helping Bulger avoid arrest.', u'In 2008, Special Agent Connolly completed his term on the federal charges and was transferred to Florida where he was convicted of helping plan the murder of John B Callahan, a Bulger rival.', u'In 2014, that conviction was overturned on a technicality.', u'Connolly was the agent leading the investigation of Bulger.', u'In June 2011, the 81-year-old Bulger was arrested in Santa Monica, California.', u'Bulger was tried on 32 counts of racketeering, money laundering, extortion, and weapons charges; including complicity in 19 murders.', u'In August 2013, the jury found him guilty on 31 counts, and having been involved in 11 murders.', u'Bulger was sentenced to two consecutive life terms plus five years.', u'=== Robert Hanssen ===\nOn 20 February 2001, the bureau announced that a special agent, Robert Hanssen (born 1944) had been arrested for spying for the Soviet Union and then Russia from 1979 to 2001.', u'He is serving 15 consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole at ADX Florence, a federal supermax prison near Florence, Colorado.', u'Hanssen was arrested on February 18, 2001, at Foxstone Park near his home in Vienna, Virginia, and was charged with selling US secrets to the USSR and subsequently Russia for more than US$1.4 million in cash and diamonds over a 22-year period.', u'On July 6, 2001, he pleaded guilty to 15 counts of espionage in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.', u'His spying activities have been described by the US Department of Justice\'s Commission for the Review of FBI Security Programs as "possibly the worst intelligence disaster in U.S. history".', u'=== Death of Filiberto Ojeda Rios ===\n\nIn 2005, fugitive Puerto Rican Nationalist leader Filiberto Ojeda R\xedos died in a gun battle with FBI agents in 2005 in what some charged was an assassination.', u'Puerto Rico Governor An\xedbal Acevedo Vil\xe1 criticized the FBI assault as "improper" and "highly irregular" and demanded to know why his government was not informed of it.', u'The FBI refused to release information beyond the official press release, citing security and agent privacy issues.', u"The Puerto Rico Justice Department filed suit in federal court against the FBI and the US Attorney General, demanding information crucial to the Commonwealth's own investigation of the incident.", u'The case was dismissed by the U.S Supreme Court.', u"Ojeda Rios' funeral was attended by a long list of dignitaries, including the highest authority of the Roman Catholic Church in Puerto Rico, Archbishop Roberto Octavio Gonz\xe1lez Nieves, ex-Governor Rafael Hern\xe1ndez Col\xf3n, and numerous other personalities.", u'In the aftermath of his death, the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization approved a draft resolution urging a "probe of [the] pro-independence killing, human rights abuses", after "Petitioner after petitioner condemned the assassination of Mr. Ojeda Rios by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)".', u'=== Wikipedia edits ===\nIn August 2007 Virgil Griffith, a Caltech computation and neural-systems graduate student, created a searchable database that linked changes made by anonymous Wikipedia editors to companies and organizations from which the changes were made.', u'The database cross-referenced logs of Wikipedia edits with publicly available records pertaining to the Internet IP addresses edits were made from.', u'Griffith was motivated by the edits from the United States Congress, and wanted to see if others were similarly promoting themselves.', u'The tool was designed to detect conflict of interest edits.', u'Among his findings were that FBI computers were used to edit the FBI article on Wikipedia.', u'Although the edits correlated with known FBI IP addresses, there was no proof that the changes actually came from a member or employee of the FBI, only that someone who had access to their network had edited the FBI article on Wikipedia.', u'Wikipedia spokespersons received Griffith\'s "WikiScanner" positively, noting that it helped prevent conflicts of interest from influencing articles as well as increasing transparency and mitigating attempts to remove or distort relevant facts.', u"=== Hillary Clinton email investigation ===\n\nOn July 5, 2016, FBI Director Comey announced the bureau's recommendation that the United States Department of Justice file no criminal charges relating to the Hillary Clinton email controversy.", u'During an unusual 15 minute press conference in the J. Edgar Hoover Building, Comey called Secretary Clinton\'s and her top aides\' behavior "extremely careless", but concluded that "no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case".', u'Comey\'s public comments came after Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that she would "fully" accept the recommendation of the FBI regarding the probe.', u'It was the first time the FBI disclosed its prosecutorial recommendation to the Department of Justice publicly.', u"On July 7, 2016, Comey was questioned by a Republican-led House committee during a hearing regarding the FBI's recommendation.", u'On October 28, 2016, less than two weeks before the presidential election, Director Comey, a long-time Republican, announced in a letter to Congress that additional emails potentially related to the Clinton email controversy had been found and that the FBI will investigate "to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation."', u'At the time Comey sent his letter to Congress, the FBI had still not obtained a warrant to review any of the e-mails in question and was not aware of the content of any of the e-mails in question.', u"Comey's announcement was inconsistent with Justice Department policy and he was warned by lawyers at the Department of Justice against proceeding with his letter to Congress.", u'Both Republican and Democrat lawmakers, as well as both the Clinton and Trump campaigns have called on Comey to provide additional details.', u"After Comey's letter to Congress, commentator Paul Callan of CNN and Niall O'Dowd of Irish Central compared Comey to J. Edgar Hoover in attempting to influence and manipulate elections.", u'On October 30, 2016, Richard Painter, chief White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush Administration, published an op-ed piece in the NY Times, stating that he had filed a complaint against the FBI with the Office of Special Counsel, which investigates possible violations of the Hatch Act of 1939, and with the Office of Government Ethics with respect to the sending of the letter.', u"In the days after the FBI intervention, Rudy Giuliani indicated that the Trump campaign was briefed by the FBI days before Comey's letter was sent to Congress.", u"On November 6, 2016, in the face of constant pressure from both Republicans and Democrats, Comey conceded in a second letter to Congress that through the FBI's review of the new e-mails, there was no wrongdoing by Clinton.", u'Comey conceded, "Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July."', u"While the e-mail matter is resolved, legal questions on Comey's actions remain.", u'Comey and the FBI have been broadly criticized on the editorial pages from both the right and the left, with headlines reading: "James Comey should be fired" (Chicago Tribune); "FBI chief James Comey should resign" (The Washington Times); and "FBI Director James Comey is Unfit for Public Service" (Newsweek).', u'== Media portrayal ==\n\nThe FBI has been frequently depicted in popular media since the 1930s.', u'The bureau has participated to varying degrees, which has ranged from direct involvement in the creative process of film or TV series development, to providing consultation on operations and closed cases.', u'A few of the notable portrayals of the FBI on television are the 1993\u20132002 series The X-Files, which concerned investigations into paranormal phenomena by five fictional Special Agents, and the fictional Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU) agency in the TV drama 24, which is patterned after the FBI Counterterrorism Division.', u'The 1991 movie Point Break is based on the true story of an undercover FBI agent who infiltrated a gang of bank robbers.', u'The 1997 movie Donnie Brasco is based on the true story of undercover FBI agent Joseph D. Pistone infiltrating the Mafia.', u'== Notable FBI personnel ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHSI BOOK Government HSI Files\nCharles, Douglas M. (2007).', u'J.

{'sentences': [u'A treaty is an agreement under international law entered into by actors in international law, namely sovereign states and international organizations.', u'A treaty may also be known as an (international) agreement, protocol, covenant, convention, pact, or exchange of letters, among other terms.', u'Regardless of terminology, all of these forms of agreements are, under international law, equally considered treaties and the rules are the same.', u'Treaties can be loosely compared to contracts: both are means of willing parties assuming obligations among themselves, and a party to either that fails to live up to their obligations can be held liable under international law.', u'== Modern usage ==\nA treaty is an official, express written agreement that states use to legally bind themselves.', u'A treaty is the official document which expresses that agreement in words; and it is also the objective outcome of a ceremonial occasion which acknowledges the parties and their defined relationships.', u'== Modern form ==\nSince the late 19th century, most treaties have followed a fairly consistent format.', u'A treaty typically begins with a preamble describing the contracting parties and their joint objectives in executing the treaty, as well as summarizing any underlying events (such as a war).', u'Modern preambles are sometimes structured as a single very long sentence formatted into multiple paragraphs for readability, in which each of the paragraphs begins with a verb (desiring, recognizing, having, and so on).', u"The contracting parties' full names or sovereign titles are often included in the preamble, along with the full names and titles of their representatives, and a boilerplate clause about how their representatives have communicated (or exchanged) their full powers (i.e., the official documents appointing them to act on behalf of their respective states) and found them in good or proper form.", u'The end of the preamble and the start of the actual agreement is often signaled by the words "have agreed as follows."', u"After the preamble comes numbered articles, which contain the substance of the parties' actual agreement.", u'Each article heading usually encompasses a paragraph.', u'A long treaty may further group articles under chapter headings.', u'Modern treaties, regardless of subject matter, usually contain articles governing where the final authentic copies of the treaty will be deposited and how any subsequent disputes as to their interpretation will be peacefully resolved.', u'The end of a treaty, the eschatocol (or closing protocol), is often signaled by a clause like "in witness whereof" or "in faith whereof," the parties have affixed their signatures, followed by the words "DONE at," then the site(s) of the treaty\'s execution and the date(s) of its execution.', u'The date is typically written in its most formal, longest possible form.', u'For example, the Charter of the United Nations was "DONE at the city of San Francisco the twenty-sixth day of June, one thousand nine hundred and forty-five."', u'If the treaty is executed in multiple copies in different languages, that fact is always noted, and is followed by a stipulation that the versions in different languages are equally authentic.', u"The signatures of the parties' representatives follow at the very end.", u'When the text of a treaty is later reprinted, such as in a collection of treaties currently in effect, an editor will often append the dates on which the respective parties ratified the treaty and on which it came into effect for each party.', u'== Bilateral and Multilateral Treaties ==\nBilateral treaties are concluded between two states or entities.', u'It is possible, however, for a bilateral treaty to have more than two parties; consider for instance the bilateral treaties between Switzerland and the European Union (EU) following the Swiss rejection of the European Economic Area agreement.', u'Each of these treaties has seventeen parties.', u'These however are still bilateral, not multilateral, treaties.', u'The parties are divided into two groups, the Swiss ("on the one part") and the EU and its member states ("on the other part").', u'The treaty establishes rights and obligations between the Swiss and the EU and the member states severally\u2014it does not establish any rights and obligations amongst the EU and its member states.', u'A multilateral treaty is concluded among several countries.', u'The agreement establishes rights and obligations between each party and every other party.', u'Multilateral treaties are often regional.', u'Treaties of "mutual guarantee" are international compacts, e.g., the Treaty of Locarno which guarantees each signatory against attack from another.', u"== Adding and amending treaty obligations ==\n\n\n=== Reservations ===\n\nReservations are essentially caveats to a state's acceptance of a treaty.", u'Reservations are unilateral statements purporting to exclude or to modify the legal obligation and its effects on the reserving state.', u'These must be included at the time of signing or ratification, i.e.', u'"a party cannot add a reservation after it has already joined a treaty".', u'Originally, international law was unaccepting of treaty reservations, rejecting them unless all parties to the treaty accepted the same reservations.', u'However, in the interest of encouraging the largest number of states to join treaties, a more permissive rule regarding reservations has emerged.', u'While some treaties still expressly forbid any reservations, they are now generally permitted to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the goals and purposes of the treaty.', u'When a state limits its treaty obligations through reservations, other states party to that treaty have the option to accept those reservations, object to them, or object and oppose them.', u"If the state accepts them (or fails to act at all), both the reserving state and the accepting state are relieved of the reserved legal obligation as concerns their legal obligations to each other (accepting the reservation does not change the accepting state's legal obligations as concerns other parties to the treaty).", u'If the state opposes, the parts of the treaty affected by the reservation drop out completely and no longer create any legal obligations on the reserving and accepting state, again only as concerns each other.', u'Finally, if the state objects and opposes, there are no legal obligations under that treaty between those two state parties whatsoever.', u'The objecting and opposing state essentially refuses to acknowledge the reserving state is a party to the treaty at all.', u'=== Amendments ===\nThere are three ways an existing treaty can be amended.', u'First, formal amendment requires State parties to the treaty to go through the ratification process all over again.', u'The re-negotiation of treaty provisions can be long and protracted, and often some parties to the original treaty will not become parties to the amended treaty.', u'When determining the legal obligations of states, one party to the original treaty and one a party to the amended treaty, the states will only be bound by the terms they both agreed upon.', u'Treaties can also be amended informally by the treaty executive council when the changes are only procedural, technical change in customary international law can also amend a treaty, where state behavior evinces a new interpretation of the legal obligations under the treaty.', u'Minor corrections to a treaty may be adopted by a proc\xe8s-verbal; but a proc\xe8s-verbal is generally reserved for changes to rectify obvious errors in the text adopted, i.e.', u'where the text adopted does not correctly reflect the intention of the parties adopting it.', u'=== Protocols ===\n\nIn international law and international relations, a protocol is generally a treaty or international agreement that supplements a previous treaty or international agreement.', u'A protocol can amend the previous treaty, or add additional provisions.', u'Parties to the earlier agreement are not required to adopt the protocol.', u'Sometimes this is made clearer by calling it an "optional protocol", especially where many parties to the first agreement do not support the protocol.', u'Some examples: the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) established a framework for the development of binding greenhouse gas emission limits, while the Kyoto Protocol contained the specific provisions and regulations later agreed upon.', u"== Execution and implementation ==\nTreaties may be seen as 'self-executing', in that merely becoming a party puts the treaty and all of its obligations in action.", u"Other treaties may be non-self-executing and require 'implementing legislation'\u2014a change in the domestic law of a state party that will direct or enable it to fulfill treaty obligations.", u'An example of a treaty requiring such legislation would be one mandating local prosecution by a party for particular crimes.', u'The division between the two is often not clear and is often politicized in disagreements within a government over a treaty, since a non-self-executing treaty cannot be acted on without the proper change in domestic law.', u'If a treaty requires implementing legislation, a state may be in default of its obligations by the failure of its legislature to pass the necessary domestic laws.', u'=== Interpretation ===\nThe language of treaties, like that of any law or contract, must be interpreted when the wording does not seem clear or it is not immediately apparent how it should be applied in a perhaps unforeseen circumstance.', u'The Vienna Convention states that treaties are to be interpreted "in good faith" according to the "ordinary meaning given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose."', u"International legal experts also often invoke the 'principle of maximum effectiveness,' which interprets treaty language as having the fullest force and effect possible to establish obligations between the parties.", u'No one party to a treaty can impose its particular interpretation of the treaty upon the other parties.', u'Consent may be implied, however, if the other parties fail to explicitly disavow that initially unilateral interpretation, particularly if that state has acted upon its view of the treaty without complaint.', u"Consent by all parties to the treaty to a particular interpretation has the legal effect of adding another clause to the treaty \u2013 this is commonly called an 'authentic interpretation'.", u'International tribunals and arbiters are often called upon to resolve substantial disputes over treaty interpretations.', u'To establish the meaning in context, these judicial bodies may review the preparatory work from the negotiation and drafting of the treaty as well as the final, signed treaty itself.', u'=== Consequences of terminology ===\nOne significant part of treaty making is that signing a treaty implies recognition that the other side is a sovereign state and that the agreement being considered is enforceable under international law.', u'Hence, nations can be very careful about terming an agreement to be a treaty.', u'For example, within the United States, agreements between states are compacts and agreements between states and the federal government or between agencies of the government are memoranda of understanding.', u'Another situation can occur when one party wishes to create an obligation under international law, but the other party does not.', u'This factor has been at work with respect to discussions between North Korea and the United States over security guarantees and nuclear proliferation.', u'The terminology can also be confusing because a treaty may and usually is named something other than a treaty, such as a convention, protocol, or simply agreement.', u'Conversely some legal documents such as the Treaty of Waitangi are internationally considered to be documents under domestic law.', u'== Ending treaty obligations ==\n\n\n=== Withdrawal ===\nTreaties are not necessarily permanently binding upon the signatory parties.', u'As obligations in international law are traditionally viewed as arising only from the consent of states, many treaties expressly allow a state to withdraw as long as it follows certain procedures of notification.', u'For example, the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs provides that the treaty will terminate if, as a result of denunciations, the number of parties falls below 40.', u'Many treaties expressly forbid withdrawal.', u'Article 56 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties provides that where a treaty is silent over whether or not it can be denounced there is a rebuttable presumption that it cannot be unilaterally denounced unless:\nit can be shown that the parties intended to admit the possibility, or\na right of withdrawal can be inferred from the terms of the treaty.', u'The possibility of withdrawal depends on the terms of the treaty and its travaux preparatoire.', u'It has, for example, been held that it is not possible to withdraw from the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.', u'When North Korea declared its intention to do this the Secretary-General of the United Nations, acting as registrar, said that original signatories of the ICCPR had not overlooked the possibility of explicitly providing for withdrawal, but rather had deliberately intended not to provide for it.', u'Consequently, withdrawal was not possible.', u'In practice, because of sovereignty, any state can purport to withdraw from any treaty at any time, and cease to abide by its terms.', u'The question of whether this is lawful can be regarded as the success or failure to anticipate community acquiescence or enforcement, that is, how other states will react; for instance, another state might impose sanctions or go to war over a treaty violation.', u"If a state party's withdrawal is successful, its obligations under that treaty are considered terminated, and withdrawal by one party from a bilateral treaty of course terminates the treaty.", u'When a state withdraws from a multi-lateral treaty, that treaty will still otherwise remain in force among the other parties, unless, of course, otherwise should or could be interpreted as agreed upon between the remaining states parties to the treaty.', u'=== Suspension and termination ===\nIf a party has materially violated or breached its treaty obligations, the other parties may invoke this breach as grounds for temporarily suspending their obligations to that party under the treaty.', u'A material breach may also be invoked as grounds for permanently terminating the treaty itself.', u'A treaty breach does not automatically suspend or terminate treaty relations, however.', u'It depends on how the other parties regard the breach and how they resolve to respond to it.', u'Sometimes treaties will provide for the seriousness of a breach to be determined by a tribunal or other independent arbiter.', u"An advantage of such an arbiter is that it prevents a party from prematurely and perhaps wrongfully suspending or terminating its own obligations due to another's alleged material breach.", u'Treaties sometimes include provisions for self-termination, meaning that the treaty is automatically terminated if certain defined conditions are met.', u'Some treaties are intended by the parties to be only temporarily binding and are set to expire on a given date.', u'Other treaties may self-terminate if the treaty is meant to exist only under certain conditions.', u'A party may claim that a treaty should be terminated, even absent an express provision, if there has been a fundamental change in circumstances.', u'Such a change is sufficient if unforeseen, if it undermined the \u201cessential basis\u201d of consent by a party, if it radically transforms the extent of obligations between the parties, and if the obligations are still to be performed.', u'A party cannot base this claim on change brought about by its own breach of the treaty.', u'This claim also cannot be used to invalidate treaties that established or redrew political boundaries.', u'== Invalid treaties ==\nThere are several reasons an otherwise valid and agreed upon treaty may be rejected as a binding international agreement, most of which involve problems created at the formation of the treaty.', u'For example, the serial Japan-Korea treaties of 1905, 1907 and 1910 were protested; and they were confirmed as "already null and void" in the 1965 Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea.', u"=== Ultra vires treaties ===\nA party's consent to a treaty is invalid if it had been given by an agent or body without power to do so under that state's domestic law.", u'States are reluctant to inquire into the internal affairs and processes of other states, and so a "manifest violation" is required such that it would be "objectively evident to any State dealing with the matter".', u'A strong presumption exists internationally that a head of state has acted within his proper authority.', u'It seems that no treaty has ever actually been invalidated on this provision.', u'Consent is also invalid if it is given by a representative who ignored restrictions he is subject to by his sovereign during the negotiations, if the other parties to the treaty were notified of those restrictions prior to his signing.', u'According to the preamble in The Law of Treaties, treaties are a source of international law.', u'If an act or lack thereof is condemned under international law, the act will not assume international legality even if approved by internal law.', u'This means that in case of a conflict with domestic law, international law will always prevail.', u'=== Misunderstanding, fraud, corruption, coercion ===\nArticles 46\u201353 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties set out the only ways that treaties can be invalidated\u2014considered unenforceable and void under international law.', u'A treaty will be invalidated due to either the circumstances by which a state party joined the treaty, or due to the content of the treaty itself.', u'Invalidation is separate from withdrawal, suspension, or termination (addressed above), which all involve an alteration in the consent of the parties of a previously valid treaty rather than the invalidation of that consent in the first place.', u'A state\'s consent may be invalidated if there was an erroneous understanding of a fact or situation at the time of conclusion, which formed the "essential basis" of the state\'s consent.', u"Consent will not be invalidated if the misunderstanding was due to the state's own conduct, or if the truth should have been evident.", u'Consent will also be invalidated if it was induced by the fraudulent conduct of another party, or by the direct or indirect "corruption" of its representative by another party to the treaty.', u'Coercion of either a representative, or the state itself through the threat or use of force, if used to obtain the consent of that state to a treaty, will invalidate that consent.', u'=== Contrary to peremptory norms ===\nA treaty is null and void if it is in violation of a peremptory norm.', u'These norms, unlike other principles of customary law, are recognized as permitting no violations and so cannot be altered through treaty obligations.', u'These are limited to such universally accepted prohibitions as those against the aggressive use of force, genocide and other crimes against humanity, piracy, hostilities directed at civilian population, racial discrimination and apartheid, slavery and torture, meaning that no state can legally assume an obligation to commit or permit such acts.', u'== Role of the United Nations ==\nThe United Nations Charter states that treaties must be registered with the UN to be invoked before it or enforced in its judiciary organ, the International Court of Justice.', u'This was done to prevent the proliferation of secret treaties that occurred in the 19th and 20th century.', u"Section 103 of the Charter also states that its members' obligations under it outweigh any competing obligations under other treaties.", u'After their adoption, treaties as well as their amendments have to follow the official legal procedures of the United Nations, as applied by the Office of Legal Affairs, including signature, ratification and entry into force.', u'In function and effectiveness, the UN has been compared to the pre-Constitutional United States Federal government by some, giving a comparison between modern treaty law and the historical Articles of Confederation.', u'== Relation between national law and treaties by country ==\n\n\n=== Brazilian law ===\nThe Brazilian federal constitution states that the power to enter into treaties is vested in the president and that such treaties must be approved by Congress (articles 84, clause VIII, and 49, clause I).', u'In practice, this has been interpreted as meaning that the executive branch is free to negotiate and sign a treaty, but its ratification by the president is contingent upon the prior approval of Congress.', u'Additionally, the Federal Supreme Court has ruled that, following ratification and entry into force, a treaty must be incorporated into domestic law by means of a presidential decree published in the federal register in order to be valid in Brazil and applicable by the Brazilian authorities.', u'The Federal Supreme Court has established that treaties are subject to constitutional review and enjoy the same hierarchical position as ordinary legislation (leis ordin\xe1rias, or "ordinary laws", in Portuguese).', u'A more recent ruling by the Supreme Court in 2008 has altered that scheme somewhat, by stating that treaties containing human rights provisions enjoy a status above that of ordinary legislation, though they remain beneath the constitution itself.', u'Additionally, as per the 45th amendment to the constitution, human rights treaties which are approved by Congress by means of a special procedure enjoy the same hierarchical position as a constitutional amendment.', u'The hierarchical position of treaties in relation to domestic legislation is of relevance to the discussion on whether (and how) the latter can abrogate the former and vice versa.', u'The Brazilian federal constitution does not have a supremacy clause with the same effects as the one on the U.S. constitution, a fact that is of interest to the discussion on the relation between treaties and state legislation.', u'=== United States law ===\n\nIn the United States, the term "treaty" has a different, more restricted legal sense than exists in international law.', u'United States law distinguishes what it calls treaties from executive agreement, congressional-executive agreements, and sole executive agreements.', u'All four classes are equally treaties under international law; they are distinct only from the perspective of internal American law.', u'The distinctions are primarily concerning their method of approval.', u'Whereas treaties require advice and consent by two-thirds of the Senators present, sole executive agreements may be executed by the President acting alone.', u'Some treaties grant the President the authority to fill in the gaps with executive agreements, rather than additional treaties or protocols.', u'And finally, congressional-executive agreements require majority approval by both the House and the Senate, either before or after the treaty is signed by the President.', u'Currently, international agreements are executed by executive agreement rather than treaties at a rate of 10:1.', u'Despite the relative ease of executive agreements, the President still often chooses to pursue the formal treaty process over an executive agreement in order to gain congressional support on matters that require the Congress to pass implementing legislation or appropriate funds, and those agreements that impose long-term, complex legal obligations on the United States.', u'For example, the deal by the United States, Iran and other countries is not a Treaty.', u'See the article on the Bricker Amendment for history of the relationship between treaty powers and Constitutional provisions.', u'The Supreme Court ruled in the Head Money Cases that "treaties" do not have a privileged position over Acts of Congress and can be repealed or modified (for the purposes of U.S. law) by any subsequent Act of Congress, just like with any other regular law.', u'The Supreme Court also ruled in Reid v. Covert that any treaty provision that conflicts with the Constitution are null and void under U.S. law.', u'=== Indian law ===\nIn India, the legislation subjects are divided into 3 lists -Union List, State List and Concurrent List .', u'In the normal legislation process, the subjects in Union list can only be legislated upon by central legislative body called Parliament of India, for subjects in state list only respective state legislature can legislate.', u'While for Concurrent subjects, both center and state can make laws.', u'But to implement international treaties, Parliament can legislate on any subject overriding the general division of subject lists.', u'== Treaties and indigenous peoples ==\nTreaties formed an important part of European colonization and, in many parts of the world, Europeans attempted to legitimize their sovereignty by signing treaties with indigenous peoples.', u'In most cases these treaties were in extremely disadvantageous terms to the native people, who often did not appreciate the implications of what they were signing.', u'In some rare cases, such as with Ethiopia and Qing Dynasty China, the local governments were able to use the treaties to at least mitigate the impact of European colonization.', u'This involved learning the intricacies of European diplomatic customs and then using the treaties to prevent a power from overstepping their agreement or by playing different powers against each other.', u'In other cases, such as New Zealand and Canada, treaties allowed native peoples to maintain a minimum amount of autonomy.', u'In the case of indigenous Australians, unlike with the M\u0101ori of New Zealand, no treaty was ever entered into with the indigenous peoples entitling the Europeans to land ownership, under the doctrine of terra nullius (later overturned by Mabo v Queensland, establishing the concept of native title well after colonization was already a fait accompli).', u'Such treaties between colonizers and indigenous peoples are an important part of political discourse in the late 20th and early 21st century, the treaties being discussed have international standing as has been stated in a treaty study by the UN.', u'Prior to 1871, the government of the United States regularly entered into treaties with Native Americans but the Indian Appropriations Act of March 3, 1871 (ch.', u'120, 16 Stat.', u'563) had a rider (25 U.S.C.', u'\xa7 71) attached that effectively ended the President\u2019s treaty making by providing that no Indian nation or tribe shall be acknowledged as an independent nation, tribe, or power with whom the United States may contract by treaty.', u'The federal government continued to provide similar contractual relations with the Indian tribes after 1871 by agreements, statutes, and executive orders.', u'== See also ==\nPeace treaty\nJus tractatuum\nList of intergovernmental organizations\nList of treaties\nManrent (feudal Scottish Clan treaty)\nTreaty ratification\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nKorean Mission to the Conference on the Limitation of Armament, Washington, D.C., 1921\u20131922.', u'(1922).', u"Korea's Appeal to the Conference on Limitation of Armament.", u'Washington: U.S. Government Printing Office.', u'OCLC 12923609\nNicolson, Harold.', u'(1936).', u'Diplomacy, 1st ed.', u'Oxford: Oxford University Press.', u'OCLC 502863836\nShaw, Malcolm Nathan.', u'(1977).', u'International Law, 1st ed.', u'Sevenoaks, Kent: Hodder and Stoughton.', u'OCLC 637940121\nTimothy L.
