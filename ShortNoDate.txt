{'title': 'Brooklyn merges with NY to form present City of NY - Ellis Island became reception center for new immigrants', 'year': '1892-01-01', 'sentences': [u"Brooklyn (/\u02c8br\u028akl\u1d7bn/) is the most populous of New York City's five boroughs, with a Census-estimated 2,636,735 residents in 2015.", u'Since 1896, Brooklyn has had the same boundaries as Kings County, the most populous county in the U.S. state of New York, and the second-most densely populated county in the United States, after the county of New York (which is coextensive with the borough of Manhattan).', u"With a land area of 71 square miles (180 km2) and water area of 26 square miles (67 km2), Kings County is New York's fourth-smallest county by land area and third-smallest by total area, though it is the second-largest among the city's five boroughs.", u'Brooklyn was an independent incorporated city (and previously an authorized village and town within the provisions of the New York State Constitution) until January 1, 1898 when, after a long political campaign and public relations battle during the 1890s, according to the new Municipal Charter of "Greater New York", Brooklyn was consolidated with the other cities, boroughs, and counties to form the modern "City of New York" surrounding the Upper New York Bay with five constituent boroughs.', u'Since 2010, Brooklyn has evolved into a thriving hub of entrepreneurship and high technology startup firms, and of postmodern art and design.', u'The settlement began in the 17th century as the small Dutch-founded town of "Breuckelen" on the East River shore of Long Island, grew to be a sizable city in the 19th century, and was consolidated in 1898 with New York City (then confined to Manhattan and part of the Bronx), the remaining rural areas of Kings County, and the largely rural areas of Queens and Staten Island, to form the modern City of New York.', u'The "Breuckelen" settlement, named after Breukelen in the Netherlands, was part of New Netherland, and the Dutch West India Company lost little time in chartering the six original parishes (listed here first by their later, more common English names):\nGravesend: in 1645, settled under Dutch patent by English followers of the Anabaptist, Lady Deborah Moody, possibly after Gravesend, England, or \'s-Gravenzande, Netherlands\nBrooklyn Heights: as "Breuckelen" in 1646, after the town now spelled "Breukelen", Netherlands\nFlatlands: as "New Amersfoort" in 1647\nFlatbush: as "Midwout" in 1652\nNew Utrecht: in 1657, after the city of Utrecht, Netherlands\nBushwick: as "Boswijck" in 1661\n\nThe colony\'s capital, New Amsterdam across the East River, obtained its charter later than the village of Brooklyn did, in 1653.', u'==== Six townships in an English province ====\n\nWhat is today Brooklyn left Dutch hands after the final English conquest of New Netherland in 1664, a prelude to the Second Anglo\u2013Dutch War.', u'The English reorganized the six old Dutch towns on southwestern Long Island as Kings County on November 1, 1683, one of the "original twelve counties" then established in New York Province.', u"==== Revolutionary War ====\n\nOn August 27, 1776 was fought the Battle of Long Island (also known as the 'Battle of Brooklyn'), the first major engagement fought in the American Revolutionary War after independence was declared, and the largest of the entire conflict.", u'One result of the Treaty of Paris in 1783 was the evacuation of the British from New York City, celebrated by residents into the 20th century.', u'The first center of urbanization sprang up in the Town of Brooklyn, directly across from Lower Manhattan, which saw the incorporation of the Village of Brooklyn in 1816.', u'Town and Village were combined to form the first, kernel incarnation of the City of Brooklyn in 1834.', u'In parallel development, the Town of Bushwick, a little farther up the river, saw the incorporation of the Village of Williamsburgh in 1827, which separated as the Town of Williamsburgh in 1840 and formed the short-lived City of Williamsburgh in 1851.', u'However, the East River shore was growing too fast for the three-year-old infant City of Williamsburgh; it, along with its Town of Bushwick hinterland, was subsumed within a greater City of Brooklyn in 1854.', u'By 1841, with the appearance of the The Brooklyn Eagle, and Kings County Democrat published by Alfred G. Stevens, the growing city across the East River from Manhattan was producing its own prominent newspaper.', u'The publisher changed to L.

September 5, 1938 it was further shortened to Brooklyn Eagle.', u"Both major institutions were lost in the 1950s: the paper closed in 1955 after unsuccessful attempts at a sale following a reporters' strike, and the baseball team decamped for Los Angeles in a realignment of major league baseball in 1957.", u'The city had a population of 25,000 in 1834, but the police department only comprised 12 men on the day shift and another 12 at night.', u'Finally in 1855, a modern police force was created, employing 150 men.', u'In 1857 the state legislature merged the Brooklyn force with that of New York City.', u'They fought from 1861 to 1864, wore red the entire war, and were the only regiment named after a city; President Lincoln called them into service personally, making them part of a handful of three-year enlisted soldiers in April 1861.', u'==== Twin city ====\nBrooklyn is referred to as a twin city of New York in the 1883 poem, "The New Colossus" by Emma Lazarus, which appears on a plaque inside the Statue of Liberty.', u'The municipal Police Department, however, was abolished in 1854 in favor of a Metropolitan force covering also New York and Westchester Counties.', u'In 1865 the Brooklyn Fire Department (BFD) also gave way to the new Metropolitan Fire District.', u'The only municipal change seen was the secession of the eastern section of the Town of Flatbush as the Town of New Lots in 1852.', u'The building of rail links such as the Brighton Beach Line in 1878 heralded the end of this isolation.', u'In the space of a decade, the city annexed the Town of New Lots in 1886, the Town of Flatbush, the Town of Gravesend, the Town of New Utrecht in 1894, and the Town of Flatlands in 1896.', u'===== Mayors of the City of Brooklyn =====\n\nBrooklyn elected a mayor from 1834 until consolidation in 1898 into the City of Greater New York, whose own second mayor (1902\u20131903), Seth Low, had been Mayor of Brooklyn from 1882 to 1885.', u'Since 1898, Brooklyn has, in place of a separate mayor, elected a Borough President.', u"=== New York City borough ===\n\nIn 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge was completed, transportation to Manhattan was no longer by water only, and the City of Brooklyn's ties to the City of New York were strengthened.", u'In 1894, residents of Brooklyn and the other counties voted by a slight majority to merge, effective in 1898.', u'== Geography ==\nBrooklyn totals 97 square miles (250 km2) in area, of which 71 square miles (180 km2) is land (73%), and 26 square miles (67 km2) is water (27%); the borough is the second-largest in land area among the boroughs of New York City.', u"== Demographics ==\n\nSince 2010, the population of Brooklyn was estimated by the United States Census Bureau to have increased 5.3% to 2,636,735, as of 2015 \u2013 Brooklyn's estimated population represented 30.8% of New York City's estimated population of 8,550,405; 33.6% of Long Island's population of 7,838,722; and 13.3% of New York State's

York were legalized on June 24, 2011 and were authorized to take place beginning 30 days thereafter.', u'== Government and politics ==\n\nSince consolidation with New York City in 1898, Brooklyn has been governed by the New York City Charter that provides for a "strong" mayor-council system.', u'The office of Borough President was created in the consolidation of 1898 to balance centralization with local authority.', u'In 1989, the Supreme Court of the United States declared the Board of Estimate unconstitutional because Brooklyn, the most populous borough, had no greater effective representation on the Board than Staten Island, the least populous borough; it was a violation of the high court\'s 1964 "one man, one vote" reading of the Fourteenth Amendment.', u'Since 1990 the Borough President has acted as an advocate for the borough at the mayoral agencies, the City Council, the New York state government, and corporations.', u"Brooklyn's current Borough President is Eric Adams, elected as a Democrat in November 2013 with 90.8% of the vote.", u'As of 2005, 69.7% of registered voters in Brooklyn were Democrats.', u'Jobs in the borough have traditionally been concentrated in manufacturing, but since 1975, Brooklyn has shifted from a manufacturing-based to a service-based economy.', u'In 2004, 215,000 Brooklyn residents worked in the services sector, while 27,500 worked in manufacturing.', u'The pharmaceutical company Pfizer was founded in Brooklyn in 1869 and had a manufacturing plant in the borough for many years that once employed thousands of

{'title': 'First Rose Bowl game held in Pasadena California', 'year': '1902-01-01', 'sentences': [u"When New Year's Day falls on a Sunday, the game is played on Monday, January 2 (14 times now).", u'It was first played in 1902, and has been played annually since 1916.', u'Since 1945, it has been the highest attended college football bowl game.', u'Beginning with the 2015 game, the official name for sponsorship reasons is the "Rose Bowl Game presented by Northwestern Mutual".', u'Vizio was the previous sponsor from 2012; prior sponsors included AT&T, Sony, and Citi.', u'In 2015, the game was also officially known as the "College Football Playoff semifinal at the Rose Bowl Game presented by Northwestern Mutual."', u'The Rose Bowl Game has traditionally hosted the conference champions from the Big Ten and Pac-12 conferences (or their predecessors), but due to its past and present membership in two consortiums that seek to determine a national champion in Division I FBS, in 2002, the Rose Bowl began to infrequently deviate from its traditional match-up in order to facilitate championship games.', u'In 2002 and 2006 (2001 and 2005 football seasons), under the Bowl Championship Series system, the Rose Bowl was designated as its championship game, and hosted the top two teams determined by the BCS system.', u'Beginning in 2015, the Rose Bowl has been part of the College Football Playoff system and hosts one of its semi-final games every three years.', u'== History ==\nOriginally titled the "Tournament East\u2013West football game", the first Rose Bowl was played on January 1, 1902, starting the tradition of New Year\'s Day bowl games.', u'The football game was added in 1902 to help fund the cost of the Rose Parade.', u"The inaugural game featured Fielding H. Yost's dominating 1901 Michigan team, representing the East, which crushed a previously 3-1-2 team from Stanford University, representing the West, by a score of 49\u20130 after Stanford quit in the third quarter.", u"But, on New Year's Day 1916 football returned to stay as The State College of Washington (now Washington State University) defeated Brown University in the first annual Rose Bowl with that explicit name.", u"=== Tournament Park and Rose Bowl stadium ===\nBefore the Rose Bowl was built for the January 1, 1923 match, games were played in Pasadena's Tournament Park, approximately three miles southeast of the current Rose Bowl stadium near the campus of Caltech.", u'The Rose Bowl stadium, designed after the Yale Bowl in New Haven, then hosted the first "Rose Bowl" game in 1923.', u'The name of the stadium was alternatively "Tournament of Roses Stadium" or "Tournament of Roses Bowl", until the name "Rose Bowl" was settled on before the 1923 Rose Bowl game.', u'The stadium seating has been reconfigured several times since its original construction in 1922.', u'For many years, the Rose Bowl stadium had the largest football stadium capacity in the United States, eventually being surpassed by Michigan Stadium in 1998.', u'The maximum stated seating capacity was 104,594 from 1972 to 1997.', u'Capacity was lowered following the 1998 Rose Bowl.', u'The 2006 Rose Bowl game, which was also the BCS championship game, had a crowd of 93,986; and a crowd of 94,118 saw the 2011 Rose Bowl game between TCU and Wisconsin.', u'As of 2012, the Rose Bowl is number seven on the List of American football stadiums by capacity with a current official seating capacity of 92,542 and is still the largest stadium that hosts post-season bowl games.', u'These include the 1925 Rose Bowl, featuring Knute Rockne\'s Notre Dame team, featuring the Four Horsemen, against "Pop" Warner\'s Stanford team; the 1926 Rose Bowl, featuring Alabama Crimson Tide\u2019s win over Washington; and the 1940 Rose Bowl, featuring Howard Jones\' USC Trojans against Bob Neyland\'s Tennessee Volunteers.', u'=== 1942 venue change to Durham, North Carolina ===\n\nAfter the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and a series of attacks on West Coast shipping beginning on December 18, 1941, there were concerns about a possible Japanese attack on the West Coast.', u"On December 16, 1941, Duke University invited the game and Oregon State to Duke's home stadium in Durham, North Carolina.", u'The 1946 season was the first true post-war college football season with travel restrictions lifted and civilian college opponents returning to schedules.', u'None of the Southeastern Conference schools had an African American athlete until 1966.', u'The Cotton Bowl, Orange Bowl, and Sugar Bowl would not be integrated until 1948, 1955, and 1956 respectively.', u'=== Big Ten\u2013AAWU/Pac-8/10 agreement ===\nWhen the PCC dissolved prior to the 1959 season following a pay-for-play scandal in 1958, there was no official agreement in force.', u'The Tournament of Roses selected from the former members of PCC and invited Washington, the first champion of the newly formed Athletic Association of Western Universities (AAWU), to play Big Ten champion Wisconsin in the 1960 Rose Bowl.', u'The AAWU signed an agreement with the Rose Bowl that remained in force from the 1961 Rose Bowl until the advent of the BCS era in 1998.', u'In 1962, after Minnesota changed its vote against pursuing a new agreement (resolving a 5\u20135 voting deadlock which had prevented any new negotiations for years), a Big Ten agreement was finalized, which went into effect with the 1963 Rose Bowl and lasted until the BCS era.', u'While the Big Ten supplied the "East" representative and the PCC, AAWU, or Pac-8/10 supplied the "West" representative from the 1947 Rose Bowl to the BCS era, statements about an "exclusive" Rose Bowl agreement existing during this period are not entirely accurate: the Big Ten was not part of any agreement for the 1961 and 1962 games and the status of the agreement for 1960 is questionable, at best.', u'The fact that the 1961 Big Ten champion, Ohio State, declined the invitation to play in the 1962 Rose Bowl (without penalty) is the clearest evidence that this "exclusive agreement" did not exist in these years.', u'It officially adopted the "Pacific-8" name for the 1968 season.', u'The name changed to "Pacific-10" with the arrival of Arizona and Arizona State in 1978, its last official name change prior to the formation of the BCS in 1998.', u'The Big Ten Conference retained the same name throughout this period, even though it had eleven members by the start of the BCS era due to the addition of Penn State in 1990.', u'The notable exceptions to this rule were Washington playing in the 1960 and 1961 games and Minnesota playing in the 1961 and 1962 games during the period when the conference agreements were in a state of flux.', u'The Big Ten abolished this rule in 1972.', u'The AAWU/Pac-8 had abandoned its no-repeat rule by the time Southern California played in four consecutive Rose Bowl games from 1967 to 1970.', u'Both conferences abolished this rule before the 1975 college football season.', u'As a result, Michigan and USC were allowed to play in the 1976 Orange Bowl and the 1975 Liberty Bowl, respectively.', u'=== Bowl Championship Series ===\n\nAs of the 1998 season, with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series (BCS), team selection for the Rose Bowl was tied to the other three BCS bowls, although in any given year the Rose Bowl still attempted, if possible, to maintain the traditional Pac-10 (Pac-12 after the addition of Utah and Colorado in 2011) versus Big Ten format.', u'The 2002 game served as the BCS championship game between the BCS No.', u'This prevented a West Coast team playing in the Rose Bowl for their first time, and it also marked the first match up since 1946 to not feature the traditional pairing of Pac-10 vs. Big Ten teams.', u'The 2006 Rose Bowl game featured offensive powerhouses Texas, riding a 19-game winning streak, and USC, which entered the game with a 34-game winning streak and two Heisman Trophy winners.', u'The game had a television viewership of 35.6 million, the highest for college football contest since the 1987 Fiesta Bowl between Penn State and Miami.', u"The 2003 Rose Bowl couldn't select Big Ten co-champion and automatic qualifier Ohio State, who finished No.", u'The 2005 game featured Texas of the Big 12 Conference, selected, amid some controversy, over California of the Pac-10, marking the second time a West Coast team did not make the Rose Bowl.', u'Texas went on to defeat Michigan in the 2005 game, featuring a four-touchdown performance by Vince Young, foreshadowing his 467-yard performance a year later in the 2006 defeat of USC that won the National Title for Texas.', u'The 2004 game is also noteworthy.', u'The second BCS-era Rose Bowl arrangement ran from 2004 through 2014.', u'The 2010 TCU Horned Frogs finished their second consecutive regular season at 12\u20130, were back-to-back champions of the Mountain West Conference, and ranked No.', u'5 Wisconsin 21\u201319 in the 2011 Rose Bowl.', u'The 100th Rose Bowl Game featured a traditional pairing of Big Ten champion versus Pac-12 champion, with Michigan State playing against Stanford on January 1, 2014.', u'The Bowl Championship Series format ended with the 2014 BCS National Championship Game, played at the Rose Bowl stadium on January 6.', u'=== College Football Playoff ===\nThe BCS was replaced in 2014 by the College Football Playoff, which selects four teams for two national semifinal games, leading to a championship game.', u'The first game under the new arrangement was played on January 1, 2015 and was known as the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Rose Bowl Game presented by Northwestern Mutual.', u"Oregon defeated Florida State, 59\u201320, ending the Seminoles' 29 game-winning streak, which dated back to the end of the 2012 season.", u'As a result, Oregon advanced to the 2015 College Football Playoff National Championship played on January 12.', u"In the end, the College Football Playoff Committee ranked Iowa ahead of Ohio State, which led to Iowa's first Rose Bowl berth since 1991.", u'== Sponsorship and broadcasting rights ==\n\nFor many years the Rose Bowl eschewed sponsorship, but for the 1999 Rose Bowl, the game became known as The Rose Bowl Game presented by AT&T.', u'In 2002 it was branded The Rose Bowl Game presented by PlayStation 2.', u'From 2003 to 2010, after the agreement with Sony expired, the game was presented by Citi.', u'In June 2010, Citi decided to end sponsorship of the Rose Bowl games, including the National Championship game.', u'In October 2010, HDTV maker Vizio signed a 4-year contract to be the official sponsor of the Rose Bowl games through 2014.', u'After Vizio declined to renew sponsorship in 2014, financial services giant Northwestern Mutual became the new presenting sponsor.', u'The 1952 Rose Bowl game was the first nationally televised bowl game and the first nationally televised college game of any sport.', u"From 1952 to 1988, the Rose Bowl was televised by NBC at 2 p.m. PST, and in most years was the only New Year's Day bowl airing at that time.", u'The 1962 Rose Bowl was the first college football game broadcast in color.', u'From 1989 to 2010, the game was broadcast on ABC, usually at 2 p.m. PST; the 2005 Rose Bowl was the first one broadcast in HDTV.', u'Though, beginning in 2007, FOX had the broadcast rights to the other Bowl Championship Series games, the Rose Bowl, which negotiates its own television contract independent of the BCS, had agreed to keep the game on ABC.', u"Beginning with the 2010 season, ESPN (majority-owned by ABC's parent company, The Walt Disney Company) now broadcasts all the BCS games, including the Rose Bowl game.", u'In 2013 ESPN Deportes provided the first Spanish language telecast in the U.S. of the Rose Bowl Game.', u'The Rose Bowl game contract with ESPN was extended on June 28, 2012, to 2026, for a reportedly $80 million per year.', u'Northwestern Mutual takes over as presenting sponsor beginning in 2015 and will continue until 2020.', u'Pittsburgh appeared four times in a nine-year period, from 1927 to 1936.', u"Among Pac-8/10/12 and Big Ten schools, the record for longest drought since a team's last Rose Bowl appearance is held by California (1959), followed by Minnesota (1962), Oregon State (1965), and Indiana (1968).", u'Among Pac-8/10/12 and Big Ten schools who have played in at least one Rose Bowl, the record for the longest period since a win is held jointly by Indiana and Nebraska, who have never won, followed by Washington State (1916), Cal (1939), Oregon State (1942), Northwestern (1949), and Iowa (1959).', u'The most frequent Rose Bowl matchup is USC\u2013Michigan, occurring for the eighth time in 2007, with USC holding a 6\u20132 advantage (including rare meetings outside the Rose Bowl, USC leads this series 6\u20134).', u'The next most frequent matchup is USC\u2013Ohio State, occurring for the seventh time in 1985, with USC holding a 4\u20133 advantage.', u'From the 1946 season (1947 Rose Bowl), when the Big Ten-Rose Bowl agreement began, through the 1971 season (1972 Rose Bowl), the Big Ten did not permit the same team to represent that Conference in the Rose Bowl in consecutive years.', u'There was one exception: Minnesota played in the 1961 Rose Bowl and 1962 Rose Bowl games, as previously explained in the section on the conference agreements after the collapse of the Pacific Coast Conference.', u'Also of note, during this era Big Ten and Pac-8 teams could play only in the Rose Bowl; this restriction was not lifted until the 1975 season.', u'Legendary coach Woody Hayes led Ohio State to the Rose Bowl from 1973 to 1976, while USC head coach Pete Carroll led the Trojans to the Rose Bowl from 2006 to 2009.', u'Current members of the Pac-12 or the Big Ten to have not appeared in the Rose Bowl are Arizona (who joined the then-Pac-10 in 1978), Colorado and Utah (who both joined the Pac-12 in 2011), and Maryland and Rutgers (who both joined the Big Ten in 2014), though California appeared in the Rose Bowl only as a member of a predecessor league to the Pac-12.', u'Similar to Cal, Nebraska played in the 1941 and 2002 games, but was not a member of the Big Ten Conference at these times.', u'The Idaho and Montana, who were members of the Pacific Coast Conference from 1922 until 1958 and 1950 respectively, never finished near the top in the PCC football standings.', u'Relatively new Pac-12 members Colorado and Utah have yet to appear in one, having joined the Pac-12 on July 1, 2011.', u'The most recent additions to the Big Ten, Maryland and Rutgers, have yet to appear in one, having joined the Big Ten on July 1, 2014.', u'The Rose Bowl was exclusively a Big Ten-Pac-10 affair for 52 years, from 1946 (1947 Rose Bowl) through 1997 (1998 Rose Bowl).', u'The BCS era covered sixteen games, starting with the 1999 (85th) Rose Bowl to the 2014 (100th) Rose Bowl .', u'However, the 2007 (93rd) Rose Bowl and 2008 (94th) Rose Bowl, each Big Ten losses to the Pac-12, actually featured the Big Ten runner-up, as conference champion Ohio State was selected to play each of those years in the BCS National Championship Game.', u'The 2002 and 2006 Rose Bowls represented the National Championship game.', u'In 2002, there was neither a Big Ten or Pac-10 school, as Oregon was in the Fiesta Bowl while Illinois was in the Sugar Bowl.', u'In 2006, top-ranked USC represented the Pac-10 in the National Championship Game in the Rose Bowl against second-ranked Texas from the Big 12 Conference.', u'The other two non-Big Ten vs. Pac-10 matchups in the BCS era involved Big 12 Conference teams: Oklahoma in the 2003 (89th) Rose Bowl and Texas in the 2005 (91st) Rose Bowl.', u'The 2011 Rose Bowl Game marked the sole time during the BCS era that a school from a non-BCS conference played in the game (as Oregon, the Pacific-10 champion, was selected to play in the BCS National Championship Game).', u'== Game arrangements ==\n\nBeginning with the 1947 Rose Bowl, the Pacific Coast representative was the home team, and the Big Nine representative was the visitor.', u'UCLA wore their home jerseys in the 1962, 1966, and 1976 Rose Bowl games.', u'From 1947 through 2001, the Big Ten team was the home team in odd-numbered years, and the Pac-10 team was the home team in even-numbered years.', u'In 2003, Washington State was the home team, as a non-Big Ten or Pac-10 school (Oklahoma of the Big 12) was the opponent; the same applied in 2005, when Michigan played another Big 12 school, Texas.', u'Beginning with the 2002 Rose Bowl, Nebraska was home, with team and fans on the East sideline.', u'Since 2006, the home team has been the team with the highest BCS season ending ranking.', u'For the 2005 Rose Bowl, the Michigan team was on the East sideline, Texas was the visiting team and was on the West sideline.', u'For the 2006 Rose Bowl, USC was the home team and Texas was the visiting team on the West sideline.', u'In BCS Championship years, a performer was invited to sing the Anthem, the last being LeAnn Rimes in 2006.', u"== Appearances and win-loss records ==\n\n^ The Pacific Coast Conference, predecessor to the Pac-12 Conference, had their first football season in 1916, so Washington State's appearance in 1916 for the 1915 season and Stanford's appearance in 1902 for the 1901 season do not count toward the conference's total.", u"* Penn State was not a member of the Big Ten at the time of their 1923 Rose Bowl appearance, so Penn State's appearance in 1923 for the 1922 season does not count toward the Big Ten's conference's total\n\u2020 Nebraska was not a member of the Big Ten at the time of either of their appearances.", u'Therefore, as of 2014, they have not represented the Big Ten in the Rose Bowl.', u'Alabama made additional appearances in 1926, 1927, and 1931 before becoming a charter member of the SEC in 1932.', u'Another SEC charter member, Georgia Tech, made an appearance in 1929, and left the SEC in 1964.', u"Tulane, also a charter member, made an appearance in 1932, prior to the SEC's establishment in December of that year.", u'Tulane left the SEC in 1966.', u'The award was created in 1953 and awarded retroactively for players all the way back to the 1902 Rose Bowl.', u'Beginning with the 2005 Rose Bowl Game, the Rose Bowl Player of the Game Award has been given to both offensive and defensive players of the game.', u'Only four players have

15 February 1564 \u2013 8 January 1642) was an Italian polymath: astronomer, physicist, engineer, philosopher, and mathematician, he played a major role in the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century.', u'The matter was investigated by the Roman Inquisition in 1615, which concluded that heliocentrism was "foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of Holy Scripture."', u'== Early life and family ==\nGalileo was born in Pisa (then part of the Duchy of Florence), Italy, on 15 February 1564, the first of six children of Vincenzo Galilei, a famous lutenist, composer, and music theorist, and Giulia (n\xe9e Ammannati), who had married in 1562.', u'=== Name ===\nThe surname Galilei derives from the given name of an ancestor, Galileo Bonaiuti, a physician, university teacher and politician who lived in Florence from 1370 to 1450; his descendents had changed their family name from Bonaiuti (or Buonaiuti) to Galilei in his honor in the late 14th century.', u"In 1614, during the Galileo affair, one of Galileo's opponents, the Dominican priest Tommaso Caccini, delivered against Galileo a controversial and influential sermon.", u'She died on 2 April 1634, and is buried with Galileo at the Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence.', u'In 1581, when he was studying medicine, he noticed a swinging chandelier, which air currents shifted about to swing in larger and smaller arcs.', u'He created a thermoscope, a forerunner of the thermometer, and in 1586 published a small book on the design of a hydrostatic balance he had invented (which first brought him to the attention of the scholarly world).', u'Galileo also studied disegno, a term encompassing fine art, and in 1588 obtained the position of instructor in the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno in Florence, teaching perspective and chiaroscuro.', u'In 1589, he was appointed to the chair of mathematics in Pisa.', u'In 1591, his father died, and he was entrusted with the care of his younger brother Michelagnolo.', u'In 1592, he moved to the University of Padua where he taught geometry, mechanics, and astronomy until 1610.', u'=== Galileo, Kepler and theories of tides ===\n\nCardinal Bellarmine had written in 1615 that the Copernican system could not be defended without "a true physical demonstration that the sun does not circle the earth but the earth circles the sun".', u'He circulated his first account of the tides in 1616, addressed to Cardinal Orsini.', u'=== Controversy over comets and The Assayer ===\n\nIn 1619, Galileo became embroiled in a controversy with Father Orazio Grassi, professor of mathematics at the Jesuit Collegio Romano.', u'It began as a dispute over the nature of comets, but by the time Galileo had published The Assayer (Il Saggiatore) in 1623, his last salvo in the dispute, it had become a much wider controversy over the very nature of science itself.', u'Early in 1619, Father Grassi had anonymously published a pamphlet, An Astronomical Disputation on the Three Comets of the Year 1618, which discussed the nature of a comet that had appeared late in November of the previous year.', u"Nevertheless, following the death of Copernicus and before Galileo, heliocentrism was relatively uncontroversial; Copernicus's work was used by Pope Gregory XIII to reform the calendar in 1582.", u'Galileo defended heliocentrism based on his astronomical observations of 1609 (Sidereus Nuncius 1610).', u"In December 1613 the Grand Duchess Christina of Florence confronted one of Galileo's friends and followers, Benedetto Castelli, with biblical objections to the motion of the earth.", u"By 1615 Galileo's writings on heliocentrism had been submitted to the Roman Inquisition by Father Niccolo Lorini, who claimed that Galileo and his followers were attempting to reinterpret the Bible, which was seen as a violation of the Council of Trent and looked dangerously like Protestantism.", u'At the start of 1616, Monsignor Francesco Ingoli initiated a debate with Galileo, sending him an essay disputing the Copernican system.', u'In February 1616, an Inquisitorial commission declared heliocentrism to be "foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of Holy Scripture."', u'He revived his project of writing a book on the subject, encouraged by the election of Cardinal Maffeo Barberini as Pope Urban VIII in 1623.', u'Barberini was a friend and admirer of Galileo, and had opposed the condemnation of Galileo in 1616.', u"Galileo's resulting book, Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, was published in 1632, with formal authorization from the Inquisition and papal permission.", u'Galileo had alienated one of his biggest and most powerful supporters, the Pope, and was called to Rome to defend his writings in September 1632.', u'He finally arrived in February 1633 and was brought before inquisitor Vincenzo Maculani to be charged.', u'Throughout his trial Galileo steadfastly maintained that since 1616 he had faithfully kept his promise not to hold any of the condemned opinions, and initially he denied even defending them.', u"In view of Galileo's rather implausible denial that he had ever held Copernican ideas after 1616 or ever intended to defend them in the Dialogue, his final interrogation, in July 1633, concluded with his being threatened with torture if he did not tell the truth, but he maintained his denial despite the threat.", u'A 1640s painting by the Spanish painter Bartolom\xe9 Esteban Murillo or an artist of his school, in which the words were hidden until restoration work in 1911, depicts an imprisoned Galileo apparently gazing at the words "E pur si muove" written on the wall of his dungeon.', u'After a period with the friendly Ascanio Piccolomini (the Archbishop of Siena), Galileo was allowed to return to his villa at Arcetri near Florence in 1634, where he spent the remainder of his life under house arrest.', u'He went completely blind in 1638 and was suffering from a painful hernia and insomnia, so he was permitted to travel to Florence for medical advice.', u"Dava Sobel argues that prior to Galileo's 1633 trial and judgement for heresy, Pope Urban VIII had become preoccupied with court intrigue and problems of state, and began to fear persecution or threats to his own life.", u'== Death ==\n\nGalileo continued to receive visitors until 1642, when, after suffering fever and heart palpitations, he died on 8 January 1642, aged 77.', u'He was reburied in the main body of the basilica in 1737 after a monument had been erected there in his honour; during this move, three fingers and a tooth were removed from his remains.', u'== Astronomy ==\n\nBased only on uncertain descriptions of the first practical telescope which Hans Lippershey tried to patent in the Netherlands in 1608, Galileo, in the following year, made a telescope with about 3x magnification.', u'On 25 August 1609, he demonstrated one of his early telescopes, with a magnification of about 8 or 9, to Venetian lawmakers.', u'He published his initial telescopic astronomical observations in March 1610 in a brief treatise entitled Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger).', u"=== Kepler's supernova ===\nTycho and others had observed the supernova of 1572.", u"Ottavio Brenzoni's letter of 15 January 1605 to Galileo brought the 1572 supernova and the less bright nova of 1601 to Galileo's notice.", u"Galileo observed and discussed Kepler's supernova in 1604.", u'=== Jupiter\'s moons ===\nOn 7 January 1610, Galileo observed with his telescope what he described at the time as "three fixed stars, totally invisible by their smallness", all close to Jupiter, and lying on a straight line through it.', u"His observations were confirmed by the observatory of Christopher Clavius and he received a hero's welcome when he visited Rome in 1611.", u'Galileo continued to observe the satellites over the next eighteen months, and by mid-1611, he had obtained remarkably accurate estimates for their periods\u2014a feat which Kepler had believed impossible.', u'=== Venus, Saturn, and Neptune ===\nFrom September 1610, Galileo observed that Venus exhibited a full set of phases similar to that of the Moon.', u'The rings reappeared when he observed the planet in 1616, further confusing him.', u'Galileo also observed the planet Neptune in 1612.', u'He observed the double star Mizar in Ursa Major in 1617.', u'In his Dialogue, he reported that he had found the apparent diameter of a star of first magnitude to be no more than 5 arcseconds, and that of one of sixth magnitude to be about 5/6 arcseconds.', u'Between 1595 and 1598, Galileo devised and improved a Geometric and military compass suitable for use by gunners and surveyors.', u'In about 1593, Galileo constructed a thermometer, using the expansion and contraction of air in a bulb to move water in an attached tube.', u'In 1609, Galileo was, along with Englishman Thomas Harriot and others, among the first to use a refracting telescope as an instrument to observe stars, planets or moons.', u'The name "telescope" was coined for Galileo\'s instrument by a Greek mathematician, Giovanni Demisiani, at a banquet held in 1611 by Prince Federico Cesi to make Galileo a member of his Accademia dei Lincei.', u'In 1610, he used a telescope at close range to magnify the parts of insects.', u'By 1624 Galileo had used a compound microscope.', u"Illustrations of insects made using one of Galileo's microscopes, and published in 1625, appear to have been the first clear documentation of the use of a compound microscope.", u"In 1612, having determined the orbital periods of Jupiter's satellites, Galileo proposed that with sufficiently accurate knowledge of their orbits, one could use their positions as a universal clock, and this would make possible the determination of longitude.", u'The method was first successfully applied by Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1681 and was later used extensively for large land surveys; this method, for example, was used to survey France, and later by Zebulon Pike of the midwestern United States in 1806.', u"Galileo's son, Vincenzo, sketched a clock based on his father's theories in 1642.", u"In 1638, Galileo described an experimental method to measure the speed of light by arranging that two observers, each having lanterns equipped with shutters, observe each other's lanterns at some distance.", u"Sometime between Galileo's death and 1667, the members of the Florentine Accademia del Cimento repeated the experiment over a distance of about a mile and obtained a similarly inconclusive result.", u'The experiment described was actually performed by Simon Stevin (commonly known as Stevinus) and Jan Cornets de Groot, although the building used was actually the church tower in Delft in 1586.', u"In his 1638 Discorsi, Galileo's character Salviati, widely regarded as Galileo's spokesman, held that all unequal weights would fall with the same finite speed in a vacuum.", u"== Writings ==\n\nGalileo's early works describing scientific instruments include the 1586 tract entitled The Little Balance (La Billancetta) describing an accurate balance to weigh objects in air or water and the 1606 printed manual Le Operazioni del Compasso Geometrico et Militare on the operation of a geometrical and military compass.", u'His early works in dynamics, the science of motion and mechanics were his 1590 Pisan De Motu (On Motion) and his circa 1600 Paduan Le Meccaniche (Mechanics).', u"Galileo's 1610 The Starry Messenger (Sidereus Nuncius) was the first scientific treatise to be published based on observations made through a telescope.", u"It reported his discoveries of:\nthe Galilean moons\nthe roughness of the Moon's surface\nthe existence of a large number of stars invisible to the naked eye, particularly those responsible for the appearance of the Milky Way\ndifferences between the appearances of the planets and those of the fixed stars\u2014the former appearing as small discs, while the latter appeared as unmagnified points of light\nGalileo published a description of sunspots in 1613 entitled Letters on Sunspots suggesting the Sun and heavens are corruptible.", u'The Letters on Sunspots also reported his 1610 telescopic observations of the full set of phases of Venus, and his discovery of the puzzling "appendages" of Saturn and their even more puzzling subsequent disappearance.', u'In 1615 Galileo prepared a manuscript known as the Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina which was not published in printed form until 1636.', u'In 1616, after the order by the inquisition for Galileo not to hold or defend the Copernican position, Galileo wrote the Discourse on the Tides (Discorso sul flusso e il reflusso del mare) based on the Copernican earth, in the form of a private letter to Cardinal Orsini.', u"In 1619, Mario Guiducci, a pupil of Galileo's, published a lecture written largely by Galileo under the title Discourse on the Comets (Discorso Delle Comete), arguing against the Jesuit interpretation of comets.", u"In 1623, Galileo published The Assayer\u2014Il Saggiatore, which attacked theories based on Aristotle's authority and promoted experimentation and the mathematical formulation of scientific ideas.", u'Following the success of The Assayer, Galileo published the Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo) in 1632.', u"Despite taking care to adhere to the Inquisition's 1616 instructions, the claims in the book favouring Copernican theory and a non Geocentric model of the solar system led to Galileo being tried and banned on publication.", u'Despite the publication ban, Galileo published his Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences (Discorsi e Dimostrazioni Matematiche, intorno a due nuove scienze) in 1638 in Holland, outside the jurisdiction of the Inquisition.', u'=== Published written works ===\nGalileo\'s main written works are as follows:\nThe Little Balance (1586;

with the Decembrist revolt of 1825.', u'Although serfdom was abolished in 1861, it was done on terms unfavorable to the peasants and served to encourage revolutionaries.', u'A parliament\u2014the State Duma\u2014was established in 1906 after the Russian Revolution of 1905, but Tsar Nicholas II resisted attempts to move from absolute to constitutional monarchy.', u"A spontaneous popular uprising in Petrograd, in response to the wartime decay of Russia's economy and morale, culminated in the February Revolution and the toppling of the imperial government in March 1917.", u'On 7 November 1917, the Red Guards stormed the Winter Palace in Petrograd, ending the rule of the Provisional Government and leaving all political power to the Soviets.', u'In December, the Bolsheviks signed an armistice with the Central Powers, though by February 1918, fighting had resumed.', u"A long and bloody Civil War ensued between the Reds and the Whites, starting in 1917 and ending in 1923 with the Reds' victory.", u'It included foreign intervention, the execution of the former tsar and his family, and the famine of 1921, which killed about five million people.', u'In March 1921, during a related conflict with Poland, the Peace of Riga was signed, splitting disputed territories in Belarus and Ukraine between the Republic of Poland and Soviet Russia.', u'=== Unification of republics ===\n\nOn 28 December 1922, a conference of plenipotentiary delegations from the Russian SFSR, the Transcaucasian SFSR, the Ukrainian SSR and the Byelorussian SSR approved the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR and the Declaration of the Creation of the USSR, forming the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.', u'These two documents were confirmed by the 1st Congress of Soviets of the USSR and signed by the heads of the delegations, Mikhail Kalinin, Mikhail Tskhakaya, Mikhail Frunze, Grigory Petrovsky, and Alexander Chervyakov, on 30 December 1922.', u'On 1 February 1924, the USSR was recognized by the British Empire.', u'The same year, a Soviet Constitution was approved, legitimizing the December 1922 union.', u'An intensive restructuring of the economy, industry and politics of the country began in the early days of Soviet power in 1917.', u'The plan was developed in 1920 and covered a 10 to 15-year period.', u'The plan became the prototype for subsequent Five-Year Plans and was fulfilled by 1931.', u"Debate over the future of the economy provided the background for a power struggle in the years after Lenin's death in 1924.", u'On 3 April 1922, Stalin was named the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.', u'In October 1927, Grigory Zinoviev and Leon Trotsky were expelled from the Central Committee and forced into exile.', u'In 1928, Stalin introduced the First Five-Year Plan for building a socialist economy.', u'According to declassified Soviet archives, in 1937 and 1938, the NKVD arrested more than one and a half million people, of whom 681,692 were shot.', u'From 1932 to 1934, the Soviet Union participated in the World Disarmament Conference.', u"In 1933, diplomatic relations between the United States and the USSR were established when in November, the newly elected President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt chose to formally recognize Stalin's Communist government and negotiated a new trade agreement between the two nations.", u'In September 1934, the Soviet Union joined the League of Nations.', u'After the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, the USSR actively supported the Republican forces against the Nationalists, who were supported by Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany.', u'In December 1936, Stalin unveiled a new Soviet Constitution.', u'In 1939, almost a year after the United Kingdom and France had concluded the Munich Agreement with Germany, the USSR dealt with the Nazis as well, both militarily and economically during extensive talks.', u'The two countries concluded the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact and the German\u2013Soviet Commercial Agreement in August 1939.', u'In the east, the Soviet military won several decisive victories during border clashes with the Empire of Japan in 1938 and 1939.', u'However, in April 1941, USSR signed the Soviet\u2013Japanese Neutrality Pact with the Empire of Japan, recognizing the territorial integrity of Manchukuo, a Japanese puppet state.', u'==== World War II ====\n\nAlthough it has been debated whether the Soviet Union intended to invade Germany once it was strong enough, Germany itself broke the treaty and invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, starting what was known in the USSR as the "Great Patriotic War".', u'The Battle of Stalingrad, which lasted from late 1942 to early 1943, dealt a severe blow to the Germans from which they never fully recovered and became a turning point in the war.', u'After Stalingrad, Soviet forces drove through Eastern Europe to Berlin before Germany surrendered in 1945.', u'The same year, the USSR, in fulfillment of its agreement with the Allies at the Yalta Conference, denounced the Soviet\u2013Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1945 and invaded Manchukuo and other Japan-controlled territories on 9 August 1945.', u'A member of the United Nations at its foundation in 1945, the Soviet Union became one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, which gave it the right to veto any of its resolutions.', u'It aided post-war reconstruction in the countries of Eastern Europe, while turning them into satellite states, binding them in a military alliance (the Warsaw Pact) in 1955, and an economic organization (The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance or Comecon) from 1949 to 1991, the latter a counterpart to the European Economic Community.', u'=== Khrushchev era ===\n\nStalin died on 5 March 1953.', u"He shortly aftwerward denounced Stalin's use of repression in 1956 and proceeded to ease Stalin's repressive controls over party and society.", u'Soviet military force was used to suppress anti-Stalinist uprisings in Hungary and Poland in 1956.', u'During this period of the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Soviet Union continued to realize scientific and technological exploits in the Space Race, rivaling the United States: launching the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1 in 1957; a living dog named Laika in 1957; the first human being, Yuri Gagarin in 1961; the first woman in space, Valentina Tereshkova in 1963; Alexey Leonov, the first person to walk in space in 1965; the first soft landing on the moon by spacecraft Luna 9 in 1966 and the first moon rovers, Lunokhod 1 and Lunokhod 2.', u'In 1962, he precipitated a crisis with the United States over the Soviet deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba.', u'This event caused Khrushchev much embarrassment and loss of prestige, resulting in his removal from power in 1964.', u'In 1968, the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact allies invaded Czechoslovakia to halt the Prague Spring reforms.', u'In October 1977, the third Soviet Constitution was unanimously adopted.', u"The prevailing mood of the Soviet leadership at the time of Brezhnev's death in 1982 was one of aversion to change.", u'Yuri Andropov was 68 years old and Konstantin Chernenko 72 when they assumed power; both died in less than two years.', u'In an attempt to avoid a third short-lived leader, in 1985, the Soviets turned to the next generation and selected Mikhail Gorbachev.', u'In 1988, the Soviet Union abandoned its nine-year war in Afghanistan and began to withdraw its forces.', u"In the late 1980s, he refused military support to the Soviet Union's former satellite states, which paved the way for Revolutions of 1989.", u'In the late 1980s, the constituent republics of the Soviet Union started legal moves towards potentially declaring sovereignty over their territories, citing Article 72 of the USSR constitution, which stated that any constituent republic was free to secede.', u'On 7 April 1990, a law was passed allowing a republic to secede if more than two-thirds of its residents voted for it in a referendum.', u'Many held their first free elections in the Soviet era for their own national legislatures in 1990.', u"In 1989, the Russian SFSR, which was then the largest constituent republic (with about half of the population) convened a newly elected Congress of People's Deputies.", u"On 12 June 1990, the Congress declared Russia's sovereignty over its territory and proceeded to pass laws that attempted to supersede some of the USSR's laws.", u'After a landslide victory of S\u0105j\u016bdis in Lithuania, that country declared its independence restored on 11 March 1990.', u'A referendum for the preservation of the USSR was held on 17 March 1991 in nine republics (the remainder having boycotted the vote), with the majority of the population in those nine republics voting for preservation of the Union.', u'In the summer of 1991, the New Union Treaty, which would have turned the Soviet Union into a much looser Union, was agreed upon by eight republics.', u"In August 1991, Latvia and Estonia immediately declared the restoration of their full independence (following Lithuania's 1990 example).", u'By the fall, Gorbachev could no longer influence events outside of Moscow, and he was being challenged even there by Yeltsin, who had been elected President of Russia in July 1991.', u'On 8 December 1991, the presidents of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus (formerly Byelorussia), signed the Belavezha Accords, which declared the Soviet Union dissolved and established the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in its place.', u'While doubts remained over the authority of the accords to do this, on 21 December 1991, the representatives of all Soviet republics except Georgia signed the Alma-Ata Protocol, which confirmed the accords.', u'On 25 December 1991, Gorbachev resigned as the President of the USSR, declaring the office extinct.', u'The few remaining Soviet institutions that had not been taken over by Russia ceased to function by the end of 1991.', u'Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991, Russia was internationally recognized as its legal successor on the international stage.', u'Under the 1992 Lisbon Protocol, Russia also agreed to receive all nuclear weapons remaining in the territory of other former Soviet republics.', u'Ukraine has refused to recognize exclusive Russian claims to succession of the USSR and claimed such status for Ukraine as well, which was codified in Articles 7 and 8 of its 1991 law On Legal Succession of Ukraine.', u'Since its independence in 1991 Ukraine has continued to pursue claims against Russia in foreign courts, seeking to recover its share of the foreign property that was owned by the Soviet Union.', u'Data shows Russia, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia saw a tripling of unemployment and a 42% increase in male death rates between 1991 and 1994.', u'The Baltic states are not successor states to the Soviet Union; they are instead considered to have de jure continuity with their pre-World War II governments through the non-recognition of the original Soviet incorporation in 1940.', u'The Central Committee in turn voted for a Politburo (called the Presidium between 1952\u20131966), Secretariat and the General Secretary (First Secretary from 1953 to 1966), the de facto highest office in the USSR.', u"The Supreme Soviet elected a Presidium to wield its power between plenary sessions, ordinarily held twice a year, and appointed the Supreme Court, the Procurator General and the Council of Ministers (known before 1946 as the Council of People's Commissars), headed by the Chairman (Premier) and managing an enormous bureaucracy responsible for the administration of the economy and society.", u'State and party structures of the constituent republics largely emulated the structure of the central institutions, although the Russian SFSR, unlike the other constituent republics, for most of its history had no republican branch of the CPSU, being ruled directly by the union-wide party until 1990.', u'Under Yuri Andropov, KGB chairman in 1967\u20131982 and General Secretary from 1982 to 1983, the KGB engaged in the suppression of political dissent and maintained an extensive network of informers, reasserting itself as a political actor to some extent independent of the party-state structure, culminating in the anti-corruption campaign targeting high party officials in the late 1970s and early 1980s.', u'=== Separation of power and reform ===\n\nThe Union constitutions, which were promulgated in 1918, 1924, 1936 and 1977, did not limit state power.', u'Between 1988 and 1990, facing considerable opposition, Mikhail Gorbachev enacted reforms shifting power away from the highest bodies of the party and making the Supreme Soviet less dependent on them.', u"The Congress of People's Deputies was established, the majority of whose members were directly elected in competitive elections held in March 1989.", u'In 1990, Gorbachev introduced and assumed the position of the President of the Soviet Union, concentrated power in his executive office, independent of the party, and subordinated the government, now renamed the Cabinet of Ministers of the USSR, to himself.', u'On 19\u201321 August 1991, a group of hardliners staged an abortive coup attempt.', u'== Administrative divisions ==\n\nConstitutionally, the USSR was a federation of constituent Union Republics, which were either unitary states, such as Ukraine or Byelorussia (SSRs), or federal states, such as Russia or Transcaucasia (SFSRs), all four being the founding republics who signed the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR in December 1922.', u"In 1924, during the national delimitation in Central Asia, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan were formed from parts of the Russia's Turkestan ASSR and two Soviet dependencies, the Khorezm and Bukharan SSRs.", u'In 1929, Tajikistan was split off from the Uzbekistan.', u'With the constitution of 1936, the Transcaucasian SFSR was dissolved, resulting in its constituent republics of Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan being elevated to Union Republics, while Kazakhstan and Kirghizia were split off from Russian SFSR, resulting in the same status.', u'In August 1940, Moldavia was formed from parts of the Ukraine and Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina.', u'Karelia was split off from Russia as a Union Republic in March 1940 and was reabsorbed in 1956.', u'Between July 1956 and September 1991, there were 15 union republics (see map below).', u'After the severe economic collapse caused by the war, Lenin replaced War Communism with the New Economic Policy (NEP) in 1921, legalising free trade and private ownership of smaller businesses.', u'From the 1930s until its dissolution in late 1991, the way the Soviet economy operated remained essentially unchanged.', u'Legalization of some elements of the decentralized economy was attempted with the reform of 1965.', u'However, after 1970, the growth, while still positive, steadily declined much more quickly and consistently than in other countries despite a rapid increase in the capital stock (the rate of increase in capital was only surpassed by Japan).', u'Overall, between 1960 and 1989, the growth rate of per capita income in the Soviet Union was slightly above the world average (based on 102 countries).', u'By their calculation, per capita income of Soviet Union in 1989 should have been twice as high as it was considering the amount of investment, education and population.', u'In 1987, Mikhail Gorbachev tried to reform and revitalize the economy with his program of perestroika.', u'For most of the period after World War II up to its collapse, the Soviet economy was the second largest in the world by GDP (PPP), and was 3rd in the world during the middle of the 1980s to 1989, though in per capita terms the Soviet GDP was behind that of the First World countries.', u'When compared to countries who had a similar GDP per capita to the Soviet Union in 1928, the Soviets experienced significant growth.', u'In 1990, the Soviet Union had a Human Development Index of 0.920, placing them in the "high" category of human development.', u'At the start, this decline grew very rapidly but gradually slowed down between 1970 and 1975.', u'From 1975 and 1980, it grew even slower, only 2.6 percent.', u'In 1991, the Soviet Union had a pipeline network of 82,000 kilometres (51,000 mi) for crude oil and another 206,500 kilometres (128,300 mi) for natural gas.', u'At its peak in 1988, it was the largest producer and second largest exporter of crude oil, surpassed only by Saudi Arabia.', u"By 1989, Soviet scientists were among the world's best-trained specialists in several areas, such as energy physics, selected areas of medicine, mathematics, welding and military technologies.", u'The birth rate of the USSR decreased from 44.0 per thousand in 1926 to 18.0 in 1974, largely due to increasing urbanization and the rising average age of marriages.', u'The mortality rate demonstrated a gradual decrease as well \u2013 from 23.7 per thousand in 1926 to 8.7 in 1974.', u'The infant mortality rate increased from 24.7 in 1970 to 27.9 in 1974.', u'=== Education ===\n\nBefore 1917, education was not free in the Russian Empire and was therefore either inaccessible or barely accessible for many children from lower-class working and peasant families.', u'Estimates from 1917 recorded that 75\u201385 percent of the Russian population was illiterate.', u'By 1940, Joseph Stalin could announce that illiteracy had been eliminated.', u'According to statistics from 1986, the number of higher education students per the population of 10,000 was 181 for the USSR, compared to 517 for the U.S.\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nThe Soviet Union was a very ethnically diverse country, with more than 100 distinct ethnic groups.', u'The total population was estimated at 293 million in 1991.', u'According to a 1990 estimate, the majority were Russians (50.78%), followed by Ukrainians (15.45%) and Uzbeks (5.84%).', u'=== Health ===\n\nIn 1917, before the revolution, health conditions were significantly behind those of developed countries.', u"The Soviet principle of health care was conceived by the People's Commissariat for Health in 1918.", u'Article 42 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution gave all citizens the right to health protection and free access to any health institutions in the USSR.', u'After 1974, the government stopped publishing statistics on this.', u'The USSR had several centers of excellence, such as the Fyodorov Eye Microsurgery Complex, founded in 1988 by Russian eye surgeon Svyatoslav Fyodorov.', u'As the most widely spoken of the Soviet Union\'s many languages, Russian de facto functioned as an official language, as the "language of interethnic communication" (Russian: \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a \u043c\u0435\u0436\u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f), but only assumed the de jure status as the official national language in 1990.', u'In 1990, the religious makeup was 20% Russian Orthodox, 10% Muslim, 7% Protestant, Armenian Apostolic, Georgian Orthodox, and Roman Catholic, less than 1% Jewish and 60% atheist.', u"About 90 percent of the Soviet Union's Muslims were Sunnis, with Shias concentrated in Azerbaijan.", u'The 1918 Council of People\'s Commissars decree establishing the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) as a secular state also decreed that "the teaching of religion in all [places] where subjects of general instruction are taught, is forbidden.', u"Among further restrictions, those adopted in 1929, a half-decade into Stalin's rule, included express prohibitions on a range of church activities, including meetings for organized Bible study.", u'By 1940, as many as 90 percent of the churches, synagogues, and mosques that had been operating in 1917 were closed.', u'Amid other accommodations to religious faith after Hitler attacked the Soviet Union, churches were reopened, Radio Moscow began broadcasting a religious hour, and a historic meeting between Stalin and Orthodox Church leader Patriarch Sergius of Moscow was held in 1943.', u'During this period, the number of churches fell from 20,000 to 10,000 from 1959 to 1965, and the number of synagogues dropped from 500 to 97.', u'A poll conducted by Soviet authorities in 1982 recorded 20 percent of the Soviet population as "active religious believers."', u'Retrieved 26 May 2012.', u'RT, 21 December 2013.']}
{'title': 'Daguerrotype process announced at French Academy of Science', 'year': '1839-01-09', 'sentences': [u'Invented by Louis-Jaques-Mand\xe9 Daguerre and introduced worldwide in 1839, daguerreotypy was almost completely superseded by 1860 with new, less expensive processes yielding more readily viewable images.', u'The discovery and commercial availability of the halides: iodine, bromine and chlorine a few years earlier (iodine was discovered in 1811, bromine in 1825, and chlorine by Scheele in 1774) meant that silver photographic processes that rely on the reduction of silver chloride, silver iodide and silver chloride to metallic silver became feasible.', u"Previous discoveries of photosensitive methods and substances\u2014including silver nitrate by Albertus Magnus in the 13th century, a silver and chalk mixture by Johann Heinrich Schulze in 1724, and Joseph Ni\xe9pce's bitumen-based heliography in 1822 contributed to development of the daguerreotype.", u'The first reliably documented attempt to capture the image formed in a camera obscura was made by Thomas Wedgwood as early as the 1790s, but according to an 1802 account of his work by Sir Humphry Davy:\n\n"The images formed by means of a camera obscura have been found too faint to produce, in any moderate time, an effect upon the nitrate of silver.', u'=== Development in France ===\nIn 1829 French artist and chemist Louis Jacques-Mand\xe9 Daguerre, when obtaining a camera obscura for his work on theatrical scene painting from the optician Chevalier, was put into contact with Nic\xe9phore Ni\xe9pce, who had already managed to make a record of an image from a camera obscura using the process Ni\xe9pce invented, heliography.', u'15, for example, signified the tanning action of the sun on human skin; 34 - a camera obscura; 74 - sulphuric acid.', u"After Ni\xe9pce's death in 1833, his son, Isidore, inherited rights in the contract and a new version was drawn up between Daguerre and Isidore.", u'Daguerre wrote to Isidore Niepce on 2 January 1839 about his discussion with Arago:\n\nHe sees difficulty with this proceeding by subscription; it is almost certain \u2014 just as I myself have been convinced ever since looking on my first specimens \u2014 that subscription would not serve.', u"Miles Berry, a patent agent acting on Daguerre's and Isidore Ni\xe9pce's behalf in England, wrote a six-page memorial to the Board of the Treasury in an attempt to repeat the French arrangement in Great Britain, \u2018for the purpose of throwing it open in England for the benefit of the public.\u2019\nInform party that Parliament has placed no funds\nat the disposal of the Treasury\nfrom which a purchase of this description could be made\n(indecipherable signature)\nThe Treasury wrote to Miles Berry on 3 April to inform him of their decision:\n(To) Miles Berry Esq 66 Chancery Lane Sir, Having laid before the Lords &c your application on behalf of Messrs Daguerre & Niepce, that Government would purchase their Patent Right to the Invention known as the \u201cDaguerreotype\u201d I have it in command to acquaint you that Parliament has placed no Funds at the disposal of their Lordships from which a purchase of this description could be made 3rd April 1840 (signed) A. Gordon\n(entry in margin) Application Refused\n\nWithout bills being passed by Parliament, as had been arranged in France, Arago having presented a bill in the House of Deputies and Gay-Lussac in the Chamber of Peers, there was no possibility of repeating the French arrangement in England which is why the daguerreotype was given free to the world by the French government with the exception of England and Wales for which Richard Beard controlled the patent rights.", u'Noticing this, Daguerre supposedly wrote to Ni\xe9pce on 21 May 1831 suggesting the use of iodized silver plates as a means of obtaining light images in the camera.', u"Letters from Ni\xe9pce to Daguerre dated 24 June and 8 November 1831, show that Ni\xe9pce was unsuccessful in obtaining satisfactory results following Daguerre's suggestion, although he had produced a negative on an iodized silver plate in the camera.", u"Ni\xe9pce's letters to Daguerre dated 29 January and 3 March 1832 show that the use of iodized silver plates was due to Daguerre and not Ni\xe9pce.", u'According to Austrian chemist Josef Maria Eder, Daguerre was not versed in chemistry and it was Dumas who suggested Daguerre use sodium hyposulfite, discovered by Herschel in 1819, as a fixer to dissolve the unexposed silver salts.', u'== First mention in print (1835) and public announcement (1839) ==\nA paragraph tacked onto the end of a review of one of Daguerre\'s Diorama spectacles in the Journal des artistes on 27 September 1835, a Diorama painting of a landslide that occurred in "La Vall\xe9e de Goldau", made passing mention of rumour that was going around the Paris studios of Daguerre\'s attempts to make a visual record on metal plates of the fleeting image produced by the camera obscura:\n\n"It is said that Daguerre has found the means to collect, on a plate prepared by him, the image produced by the camera obscura, in such a way that a portrait, a landscape, or any view, projected upon this plate by the ordinary camera obscura, leaves an imprint in light and shade there, and thus presents the most perfect of all drawings ... a preparation put over this image preserves it for an indefinite time ... the physical sciences have perhaps never presented a marvel comparable to this one."', u'A further clue to fixing the date of invention of the process is that when the Paris correspondent of the London periodical The Athenaeum reported the public announcement of the daguerreotype in 1839, he mentioned that the daguerreotypes now being produced were considerably better than the ones he had seen "four years earlier".', u'Fran\xe7ois Arago briefly mentioned the heliograph, the physautotype and the daguerreotype process at a joint meeting of the French Academy of Sciences and the Acad\xe9mie des Beaux-Arts held at the Institut de Fran\xe7e on Monday, 19 August 1839.', u'Together, these announcements cause commentators to choose the 1839 as the year photography was born, or made public.', u"The phrase the birth of photography has been used by different authors to mean different things: - either the publicizing of the process (in 1839) as a metaphor to indicate that previous to that the daguerreotype process had been kept secret; or, the date the first photograph was taken by or with a camera (using the asphalt process or heliography thought to have been 1822, but Eder's research indicates that the date was more probably 1826 or later.", u'The government would then present the daguerreotype process "free to the world" as a gift, which it did on 19 August 1839.', u'This was the usual wording of English patent specifications before 1852.', u'It was only after the 1852 Act, which unified the patent systems of England, Ireland and Scotland, that a single patent protection was automatically extended to the whole of the British Isles, including the Channel Isles and the Isle of Man.', u"Much of Daguerre's early work was destroyed when his home and studio caught fire on 8 March 1839, while the painter Samuel Morse was visiting from the US.", u'In the Becquerel variation of the process, published in 1840 but very seldom used in the 19th century, the plate, sensitized by fuming with iodine alone, was developed by overall exposure to sunlight passing through yellow or red glass.', u"Gilding, also called gold toning, was an addition to Daguerre's process introduced by Hippolyte Fizeau in 1840.", u'The word "Union" referred to the sawdust and varnish mixture\u2014the manufacture of Union cases began in 1856.', u'A much "faster" lens could have been provided\u2014simply omitting the integral fixed diaphragm from the Chevalier lens would have increased its working aperture to about f/4.7 and reduced the exposure time by nearly 90 percent\u2014but because of the existing state of lens design the much shorter exposure would have been at the cost of a peripherally distorted and very much less clear image.', u'With uncommon exceptions, daguerreotypes made before 1841 were of immobile subjects such as landscapes, public or historic buildings, monuments, statuary, and still life arrangements.', u'In 1841, the Petzval Portrait Lens was introduced.', u'The directions for the use of the Voigtl\xe4nder camera read as follows:\n\nDirections for the use of the new daguerreotype apparatus for the making of portraits, executed according to the calculations of Professor Petzval by Voigtl\xe4nder and Son, Vienna, printed by J.P.Sollinger, August 1, 1841.', u'In 1845 Friedrich von Martens invented the first panoramic camera for curved daguerreotype plates with a lens that turned to cover an angle of 150 degrees.', u'Netto constructed, in 1841, a studio in which the front part of the camera with the lens was built into the wall between the studio and the adjoining darkroom, the rear part of the camera being inside the darkroom.', u'The daguerreotypes of the 1852 Omaha Indian (Native American) delegation in the Smithsonian include a daguerrotype copied in the camera, recognizable by the contrast being high and a black line down the side of the plate.', u'In Britain, however, Richard Beard bought the British daguerreotype patent from Miles Berry in 1841 and closely controlled his investment, selling licenses throughout the country and prosecuting infringers.', u'Daguerreotype photography spread rapidly across the United States after the discovery first appeared in US newspapers in February 1839.', u'By 1853, an estimated three million daguerreotypes per year were being produced in the United States alone.', u'This method spread to other parts of the world as well:\nThe first daguerreotype in Australia was taken in 1841, but no longer survives.', u'The oldest surviving Australian daguerreotype is a portrait of Dr. William Bland taken in 1845.', u'In Jamaica Adolphe Duperly, a Frenchman, produced a booklet of Daguerreotypes, Daguerian Excursions in Jamaica, being a collection of views ... taken on the spot with the Daguerreotype which probably appeared in 1844.', u'In 1857, Ichiki Shir\u014d created the first known Japanese photograph, a portrait of his daimyo Shimazu Nariakira.', u'== Astronomical application in the 1870s ==\nIn 1839, Fran\xe7ois Arago had in his address to the French Chamber of Deputies outlined a wealth of possible applications including astronomy, and indeed the daguerreotype was still occasionally used for astronomical photography in the 1870s.', u"International group exhibitions of contemporary daguerreotypists' works have been held, notably the 2009 exhibition in Bry Sur Marne, France, with 182 daguerreotypes by forty-four artists, and the 2013 ImageObject exhibition in New York City, showcasing seventy-five works by thirty-three artists.", u'Facing the Light: Historic American Portrait Daguerreotypes: An Exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery, September 22, 1978-January 15, 1979.', u"Paris 1839 (French) Daguerre's Daguerreotype Manual."]}

(/\u02c8nju\u02d0t\u0259n/; 25 December 1642 \u2013 20 March 1726/27) was an English physicist and mathematician (described in his own day as a "natural philosopher") who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time and a key figure in the scientific revolution.', u'His book Philosophi\xe6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica ("Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"), first published in 1687, laid the foundations for classical mechanics.', u'== Life ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\n\nIsaac Newton was born according to the Julian calendar (in use in England at the time) on Christmas Day, 25 December 1642 (NS 4 January 1643), at Woolsthorpe Manor in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, a hamlet in the county of Lincolnshire.', u'He was removed from school, and by October 1659, he was to be found at Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, where his mother, widowed for a second time, attempted to make a farmer of him.', u'In June 1661, he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, on the recommendation of his uncle Rev William Ayscough who had studied there.', u"He started as a subsizar\u2014paying his way by performing valet's duties\u2014until he was awarded a scholarship in 1664, which guaranteed him four more years until he would get his M.A.", u'In 1665, he discovered the generalised binomial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory that later became calculus.', u'degree in August 1665, the university temporarily closed as a precaution against the Great Plague.', u'In April 1667, he returned to Cambridge and in October was elected as a fellow of Trinity.', u'However, by 1675 the issue could not be avoided and by then his unconventional views stood in the way.', u'His studies had impressed the Lucasian professor, Isaac Barrow, who was more anxious to develop his own religious and administrative potential (he became master of Trinity two years later), and in 1669, Newton succeeded him, only one year after he received his M.A.', u'He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1672.', u"His work on the subject usually referred to as fluxions or calculus, seen in a manuscript of October 1666, is now published among Newton's mathematical papers.", u'The author of the manuscript De analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas, sent by Isaac Barrow to John Collins in June 1669, was identified by Barrow in a letter sent to Collins in August of that year as:\n\nMr Newton, a fellow of our College, and very young ... but of an extraordinary genius and proficiency in these things.', u'Occasionally it has been suggested that Newton published almost nothing about it until 1693, and did not give a full account until 1704, while Leibniz began publishing a full account of his methods in 1684.', u'(Leibniz\'s notation and "differential Method", nowadays recognised as much more convenient notations, were adopted by continental European mathematicians, and after 1820 or so, also by British mathematicians.)', u'Such a suggestion, however, fails to notice the content of calculus which critics of Newton\'s time and modern times have pointed out in Book 1 of Newton\'s Principia itself (published 1687) and in its forerunner manuscripts, such as De motu corporum in gyrum ("On the motion of bodies in orbit"), of 1684.', u'His use of methods involving "one or more orders of the infinitesimally small" is present in his De motu corporum in gyrum of 1684 and in his papers on motion "during the two decades preceding 1684".', u"In 1691, Duillier started to write a new version of Newton's Principia, and corresponded with Leibniz.", u'In 1693, the relationship between Duillier and Newton deteriorated and the book was never completed.', u'Starting in 1699, other members of the Royal Society (of which Newton was a member) accused Leibniz of plagiarism.', u'The dispute then broke out in full force in 1711 when the Royal Society proclaimed in a study that it was Newton who was the true discoverer and labelled Leibniz a fraud.', u"Thus began the bitter controversy which marred the lives of both Newton and Leibniz until the latter's death in 1716.", u'This was published in 2013 as a chapter in a book edited by Bechler.', u'When Newton received his MA and became a Fellow of the "College of the Holy and Undivided Trinity" in 1667, he made the commitment that "I will either set Theology as the object of my studies and will take holy orders when the time prescribed by these statutes [7 years] arrives, or I will resign from the college."', u"He was appointed Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in 1669 on Barrow's recommendation.", u'==== Optics ====\nIn 1666, Newton observed that the spectrum of colours exiting a prism in the position of minimum deviation is oblong, even when the light ray entering the prism is circular, which is to say, the prism refracts different colours by different angles.', u'From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics.', u'In late 1668 he was able to produce this first reflecting telescope.', u'In 1671, the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope.', u'In his Hypothesis of Light of 1675, Newton posited the existence of the ether to transmit forces between particles.', u'In 1704, Newton published Opticks, in which he expounded his corpuscular theory of light.', u"==== Mechanics and gravitation ====\n\nIn 1679, Newton returned to his work on (celestial) mechanics by considering gravitation and its effect on the orbits of planets with reference to Kepler's laws of planetary motion.", u"Newton communicated his results to Edmond Halley and to the Royal Society in De motu corporum in gyrum, a tract written on about nine sheets which was copied into the Royal Society's Register Book in December 1684.", u'The Principia was published on 5 July 1687 with encouragement and financial help from Edmond Halley.', u'He found 72 of the 78 species of cubics.', u"He also divided them into four types, satisfying different equations, and in 1717 Stirling, probably with Newton's help, proved that every cubic was one of these four types.", u'Newton also claimed that the four types could be obtained by plane projection from one of them, and this was proved in 1731.', u'A manuscript Newton sent to John Locke in which he disputed the fidelity of 1 John 5:7 and its fidelity to the original manuscripts of the New Testament, remained unpublished until 1785.', u'Newton moved to London to take up the post of warden of the Royal Mint in 1696, a position that he had obtained through the patronage of Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax, then Chancellor of the Exchequer.', u'Newton became perhaps the best-known Master of the Mint upon the death of Thomas Neale in 1699, a position Newton held for the last 30 years of his life.', u'These appointments were intended as sinecures, but Newton took them seriously, retiring from his Cambridge duties in 1701, and exercising his power to reform the currency and punish clippers and counterfeiters.', u'As Warden, and afterwards Master, of the Royal Mint, Newton estimated that 20 percent of the coins taken in during the Great Recoinage of 1696 were counterfeit.', u'Then he conducted more than 100 cross-examinations of witnesses, informers, and suspects between June 1698 and Christmas 1699.', u"As a result of a report written by Newton on 21 September 1717 to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury the bimetallic relationship between gold coins and silver coins was changed by Royal proclamation on 22 December 1717, forbidding the exchange of gold guineas for more than 21 silver shillings.", u'Newton was made President of the Royal Society in 1703 and an associate of the French Acad\xe9mie des Sciences.', u'In April 1705, Queen Anne knighted Newton during a royal visit to Trinity College, Cambridge.', u"The knighthood is likely to have been motivated by political considerations connected with the Parliamentary election in May 1705, rather than any recognition of Newton's scientific work or services as Master of the Mint.", u'Towards the end of his life, Newton took up residence at Cranbury Park, near Winchester with his niece and her husband, until his death in 1727.', u'Newton died in his sleep in London on 20 March 1727 (OS 20 March 1726; NS 31 March 1727) and was buried in Westminster Abbey.', u'Newton did have a close friendship with the Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, whom he met in London around 1690.', u'Their intense relationship came to an abrupt and unexplained end in 1693, and at

Manhattan Project successfully detonated an atomic bomb in the New Mexico desert and by August had produced atomic weapons based on two alternate designs.', u'== Background ==\n\n\n=== Pacific War ===\n\nIn 1945, the Pacific War between the Empire of Japan and the Allies entered its fourth year.', u'Of the 1.25 million battle casualties incurred by the United States in World War II, including both military personnel killed in action and wounded in action, nearly one million occurred in the twelve-month period from June 1944 to June 1945.', u'December 1944 saw American battle casualties hit an all-time monthly high of 88,000 as a result of the German Ardennes Offensive.', u'In April 1945, American forces landed on Okinawa, where heavy fighting continued until June.', u"Japan's merchant fleet declined from 5,250,000 gross tons in 1941 to 1,560,000 tons in March 1945, and 557,000 tons in August 1945.", u'Lack of raw materials forced the Japanese war economy into a steep decline after the middle of 1944.', u'The civilian economy, which had slowly deteriorated throughout the war, reached disastrous levels by the middle of 1945.', u'The loss of shipping also affected the fishing

twenty-five for the entire war.", u'In February 1945, Prince Fumimaro Konoe advised the Emperor Hirohito that defeat was inevitable, and urged him to abdicate.', u'=== Preparations to invade Japan ===\n\nEven before the surrender of Nazi Germany on May 8, 1945, plans were underway for the largest operation of the Pacific War, Operation Downfall, the invasion of Japan.', u'Set to begin in October 1945, Olympic involved a series of landings by the U.S. Sixth Army intended to capture the southern third of the southernmost main Japanese island, Ky\u016bsh\u016b.', u'Operation Olympic was

States had developed plans for an air campaign against Japan prior to the Pacific War, the capture of Allied bases in the western Pacific in the first weeks of the conflict meant that this offensive did not begin until mid-1944 when the long-ranged Boeing B-29 Superfortress became ready for use in combat.', u'Strategies were shifted to accommodate the air war, and the islands were captured between June and August 1944.', u'Air bases were developed, and B-29 operations commenced from the Marianas in October 1944.', u'The XXI Bomber Command began missions against Japan on November 18,

by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, and its theoretical explanation by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, made the development of an atomic bomb a theoretical possibility.', u'This prompted preliminary research in the United States in late 1939.', u'Progress was slow until the arrival of the British MAUD Committee report in late 1941, which indicated that only 5\u201310

for bombing for final approval by himself and Stimson.', u'The target was unlikely to be attacked by August 1945.', u'=== Proposed demonstration ===\nIn early May 1945, the Interim Committee was created by Stimson at the urging of leaders of the Manhattan Project and with the approval of Truman to advise on matters pertaining to nuclear energy.', u'Under the 1943 Quebec Agreement with the United Kingdom, the United States had agreed that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent.', u'In June 1945 the head of the British Joint Staff Mission, Field Marshal Sir Henry Maitland Wilson, agreed that the use of nuclear weapons against Japan would be officially recorded as a decision of the Combined Policy Committee.', u'=== Bombs ===\nThe Little Boy bomb, except for the uranium payload, was ready at the beginning of May 1945.', u'More realistic city officials had ordered buildings torn down to create long, straight firebreaks, beginning in 1944.', u'Firebreaks continued to be expanded and extended up to the morning of August 6, 1945.', u'Radar detected 65 bombers headed for Saga, 102 bound for Maebashi, 261 en route to Nishinomiya, 111 headed for Ube and 66 bound for Imabari.', u'It created a blast equivalent to 16 kilotons of TNT (67 TJ), \xb1 2 kt.', u'The radius of total destruction was about 1 mile (1.6 km), with resulting fires

freedom and promote the common good and did everything possible to save his life."', u'=== A martyr of science ===\nSome authors have characterized Bruno as a "martyr of science," suggesting parallels

certainly not a heresy.', u"== Artistic depictions ==\nFollowing the 1870 Capture of Rome by the newly created Kingdom of Italy and the end of the Church's temporal power over the city, the erection of a monument to Bruno on the site of his execution became feasible.", u'The monument was sharply opposed by the clerical party, but was finally erected by the Rome Municipality and inaugurated in

McClellan general-in-chief of all the Union armies.', u'Lincoln removed McClellan as general-in-chief in March 1862, after McClellan\'s "Harrison\'s Landing Letter", in which he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort.', u'However, lacking requested reinforcements from McClellan, now commanding the Army of the Potomac, Pope was soundly defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time.', u'The war also expanded with naval operations in 1862 when the CSS Virginia, formerly the USS Merrimack, damaged or destroyed three Union vessels in Norfolk, Virginia, before being engaged and damaged by the USS Monitor.', u"Two days after McClellan's return to command, General Robert E. Lee's forces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland, leading to the Battle of Antietam in September 1862.", u'As a result, Lincoln replaced Buell with William Rosecrans; and, after the 1862 midterm elections, he replaced McClellan with Republican Ambrose Burnside.', u'Desertions during 1863 were in the thousands and they increased after Fredericksburg.', u'The mid-term elections in 1862 brought the Republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor with the administration over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war, as well as rising inflation, new high taxes, rumors of corruption, the suspension of habeas corpus, the military draft law, and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market.', u"In the spring of 1863, Lincoln was optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together; these plans included Hooker's attack on Lee north of Richmond, Rosecrans' on Chattanooga, Grant's on Vicksburg, and a naval assault on Charleston.", u"=== Emancipation Proclamation ===\n\nLincoln understood that the Federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution, which before 1865, committed the issue to individual states.", u'President Lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by Major General John C. Fr\xe9mont in August 1861 and by Major General David Hunter in May 1862, on the grounds that it was not within their power, and it would upset the border states loyal to the Union.', u'On June 19, 1862, endorsed by Lincoln, Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory.', u'In July, the Confiscation Act of 1862 was passed, which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion.', u'In it, he stated that "as a fit and necessary military measure, on January 1, 1863, all persons held as slaves in the Confederate states will thenceforward, and forever, be free".', u'Republican editor Horace Greeley of the highly influential New York Tribune fell for the ploy, and Lincoln refuted it directly in a shrewd letter of August 22, 1862.', u'The Emancipation Proclamation, issued on September 22, 1862, and put into effect on January 1, 1863, declared free the slaves in 10 states not then under Union control, with exemptions specified for areas already under Union control in two states.', u'Lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation, while Democrats rallied their voters in the 1862 off-year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites.', u'By the spring of 1863, Lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers.', u"By the end of 1863, at Lincoln's direction, General Lorenzo Thomas had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the Mississippi Valley.", u'=== Gettysburg Address (1863) ===\n\nWith the great Union victory at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, and the defeat of the Copperheads in the Ohio election in the fall, Lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort, despite the New York City draft riots.', u'The stage was set for his address at the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery on November 19, 1863.', u'In 272 words, and three minutes, Lincoln asserted the nation was born not in 1789, but in 1776, "conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal".', u'Nevertheless, Lincoln was concerned that Grant might be considering a candidacy for President in 1864, as McClellan was.', u'Grant waged his bloody Overland Campaign in 1864.', u"The damage caused by Sherman's March to the Sea through Georgia in 1864 was limited to a 60-mile (97 km) swath, but neither Lincoln nor his commanders saw destruction as the main goal, but rather defeat of the Confederate armies.", u'During Early\'s raid on Washington, D.C. in 1864, Lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position; Captain Oliver Wendell Holmes shouted at him, "Get down, you damn fool, before you get shot!"', u"On April 1, 1865, Grant successfully outflanked Lee's forces in the Battle of Five Forks and nearly encircled Petersburg, and the Confederate government evacuated Richmond.", u'=== 1864 re-election ===\n\nWhile the war was still being waged, Lincoln faced reelection in 1864.', u'Lincoln spent many hours a week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powers\u2014greatly expanded over peacetime\u2014to hold the factions of his party together, build support for his own policies, and fend off efforts by Radicals to drop him from the 1864 ticket.', u'At its 1864 convention, the Republican Party selected Johnson, a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate.', u"When Grant's 1864 spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates and Union casualties mounted, the lack of military success wore heavily on the President's re-election prospects, and many Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated.", u"On November 8, Lincoln was re-elected in a landslide, carrying all but three states, and receiving 78 percent of the Union soldiers' vote.", u'On March 4, 1865, Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address.', u'His Amnesty Proclamation of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.', u'On the other hand, the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the Wade-Davis Bill, in 1864.', u'By December 1863, a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery was brought to Congress for passage.', u'This first attempt at an amendment failed to pass, falling short of the required two-thirds majority on June 15, 1864, in the House of Representatives.', u'Passage of the proposed amendment became part of the Republican/Unionist platform in the election of 1864.', u'After a long debate in the House, a second attempt passed Congress on January 31, 1865, and was sent to the state legislatures for ratification.', u'Upon ratification, it became the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution on December 6, 1865.', u'He believed, as most Republicans did in April 1865, that the voting requirements should be determined by the states.', u'As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech of early 1860, "Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself."', u'Nevertheless, in 1861, Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state.', u"In March 1861, in Lincoln's first inaugural address, he explored the nature of democracy.", u'He signed the Homestead Act in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost.', u'The Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state.', u"The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' First Transcontinental Railroad, which was completed in 1869.", u'In 1861, Lincoln signed the second and third Morrill Tariff, the first having become law under James Buchanan.', u'Also in 1861, Lincoln signed the Revenue Act of 1861, creating the first U.S. income tax.', u'This created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 ($21,100 in current dollar terms), which was later changed by the Revenue Act of 1862 to a progressive rate structure.', u"In 1862, Congress created, with Lincoln's approval, the Department of Agriculture.", u'In 1862, Lincoln sent a senior general, John Pope, to put down the "Sioux Uprising" in Minnesota.', u'In 1863, Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November of that year to be a day of Thanksgiving.', u'In June 1864, Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress, which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as Yosemite National Park.', u'=== Judicial appointments ===\n\n\n==== Supreme Court appointments ====\nNoah Haynes Swayne \u2013 1862\nSamuel Freeman Miller \u2013

Chase, was nominated as Chief Justice, and appointed the same day, on December 6, 1864.", u'=== States admitted to the Union ===\nWest Virginia, admitted to the Union June 20, 1863, contained the former north-westernmost counties of Virginia that seceded from Virginia after that commonwealth declared its secession from the Union.', u'Nevada, which became the third State in the far-west of the continent, was admitted as a free state on October 31, 1864.', u"== Assassination and funeral ==\n\nAbraham Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth on Good Friday, April 14, 1865, while attending a play at Ford's Theatre as the American Civil War was drawing to a close.", u'In 1864, Booth formulated a plan (very similar to one of Thomas N.
