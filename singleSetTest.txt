returned to its status as a public park, in much better shape than its original swampy form.', u'The lagoon was reshaped to give it a more natural appearance, except for the straight-line northern end where it still laps up against the steps on the south side of the Palace of Fine Arts/Museum of Science & Industry building.', u'The Midway Plaisance, a park-like boulevard which extends west from Jackson Park, once formed the southern boundary of the University of Chicago, which was being built as the fair was closing (the university has since developed south of the Midway).', u'The university\'s football team, the Maroons, were the original "Monsters of the Midway".', u'The exposition is mentioned in the university\'s alma mater: "The City White hath fled the earth,/But where the azure waters lie,/A nobler city hath its birth,/The City Gray that ne\'er shall die."', u'== Electricity at the fair ==\n\nThe effort to power the Fair with electricity, which became a demonstration piece for Westinghouse Electric and the alternating current system they had been developing for many years, took place at the end of what has been called the War of the currents between DC and AC.', u'Westinghouse initially did not put in a bid to power the Fair but agreed to be the contractor for a local Chicago company that put in a low bid of US$510,000 to supply an alternating current based system.', u'Edison General Electric, which at the time was merging with the Thomson-Houston Electric Company to form General Electric, put in a US$1,720,000 bid to power the Fair and its planned 93,000 incandescent lamps with direct current.', u'After the Fair committee went over both proposals Edison General Electric re-bid their costs at $554,000 but Westinghouse under bid them by 70 cents per lamp to get the contract.', u'Westinghouse could not use the Edison incandescent lamp since the patent belonged to General Electric and they had successfully sued to stop use of all patent infringing designs.', u'Since Edison specified a sealed globe of glass in his design Westinghouse found a way to sidestep the Edison patent by quickly developing a lamp with a ground glass stopper in one end, based on a Sawyer-Man "stopper" lamp patent they already had.', u'The lamps worked well but were short lived, requiring a small army of workmen to constantly replace them.', u'Westinghouse Electric had severely underbid the contract and struggled to supply all the equipment specified including twelve 1,000 horsepower single phase AC generators and all the lighting and other equipment required.', u'They also had to fend off a last minute lawsuit by General Electric claiming the Westinghouse Sawyer-Man based stopper lamp infringed on the Edison incandescent lamp patent.', u'The International Exposition held an Electricity Building which was devoted to electrical exhibits.', u'A statue of Benjamin Franklin was displayed at the entrance.', u"The exposition featured interior and exterior light and displays as well as displays of Thomas Edison's kinetoscope, search lights, a seismograph, electric incubators for chicken eggs, and Morse code telegraph.", u'All the exhibits were from commercial enterprises.', u'Participants included General Electric, Brush, Western Electric, and Westinghouse.', u'The Westinghouse Company displayed several polyphase systems.', u'The exhibits included a switchboard, polyphase generators, step-up transformers, transmission line, step-down transformers, commercial size induction motors and synchronous motors, and rotary direct current converters (including an operational railway motor).', u'The working scaled system allowed the public a view of a system of polyphase power which could be transmitted over long distances, and be utilized, including the supply of direct current.', u'Meters and other auxiliary devices were also present.', u'Part of the space occupied by the Westinghouse Company was devoted to demonstrations of electrical devices developed by Nikola Tesla including a two-phase induction motor, and generators to power the system.', u'Tesla demonstrated a series of electrical effects, some which were in previous lectures performed in America and Europe.', u'This included using high-voltage, high-frequency alternating current to light a wireless gas-discharge lamp.', u'Also at the Fair, the Chicago Athletic Association Football team played one of the very first night football games against West Point (the earliest being on September 28, 1892 between Mansfield State Normal and Wyoming

{'sentences': [u'Tony Sheridan (Anthony Esmond Sheridan McGinnity; 21 May 1940 \u2013 16 February 2013) was an English rock and roll singer-songwriter and guitarist.', u'He was best known as an early collaborator of the Beatles (though the record was labelled as being with "The Beat Brothers"), one of two non-Beatles (the other being Billy Preston) to receive label performance credit on a record with the group, and the only non-Beatle to appear as lead singer on a Beatles recording which charted as a single.', u'== Biography ==\nSheridan was born in Norwich, Norfolk, where he grew up at 2 Hansell Road in Thorpe St Andrew and attended the City of Norwich School.', u"In his early life, Sheridan was influenced by his parents' interest in classical music, and by age seven, he had learned to play the violin.", u'He eventually came to play guitar, and in 1956, formed his first band.', u'He showed enough talent that he soon found himself playing in London\'s "Two I\'s" club for some six months straight.', u'In 1958, aged 18, he began appearing on Oh Boy, made by the ITV contractor ABC, playing electric guitar on such early rock classics as "Blue Suede Shoes", "Glad All Over", "Mighty Mighty Man" and "Oh Boy!".', u'He was soon employed backing a number of singers, reportedly including Gene Vincent and Conway Twitty while they were in England.', u"In 1958 Johnny Foster sought to recruit Sheridan as a guitar player in Cliff Richard's backing band (soon renamed the Shadows), but after failing to find him at the 2i's Coffee Bar opted for another guitarist who was there, Hank Marvin.", u'Early in 1960, he performed in a tour of the UK, along with Vincent and Eddie Cochran.', u'On 16 April, Vincent and Cochran rebuffed his request to ride along with them to the next venue, but he thereby escaped the road accident which would leave Cochran dead and Vincent badly injured.', u'Sheridan played guitar for Cherry Wainer on her recording of "Happy Organ".', u'Despite these successes, his penchant for being late, showing up without his guitar, etc., soon got him a reputation for having gone a bit "haywire", and cost him much of his professional standing in England.', u'Providentially, an offer for a gig came from Bruno Koschmider\'s "Kaiserkeller" club in Hamburg, Germany for an English group to play there.', u'Sheridan and others (including Colin "Melander" Crawley) joined an ad hoc group promptly dubbed "The Jets" and were put on the ship headed for Hamburg.', u'As fate would have it, legal woes (i.e.', u'lack of proper papers) caused "The Jets" to not last long, but Sheridan (and now-friend Colin "Melander" Crawley) were soon back onstage in Hamburg.', u'While performing in Hamburg between 1960 and 1963, Sheridan employed various backup bands, most of which were really "pickup bands", or simply an amalgam of various musicians, rather than a group proper (though almost always including now bassist Colin "Melander" Crawley).', u'However, in 1961, the young Beatles (with their line-up at the time of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Pete Best) who had met and admired Sheridan during their first visit to Hamburg in 1960, and who openly worked with him on their second visit, became even closer.', u'The Beatles sometimes backed Sheridan, who, in turn, often joined the Beatles during their own sets backing them on guitar.', u"They even visited Sheridan's home and had jamming sessions in the back garden \nWhen German Polydor producer/A and R man Bert Kaempfert saw the pairing on stage, he suggested that Sheridan and the Beatles make some recordings together.", u'Kaempfert viewed Sheridan as the one with "star" potential, and though they signed the Beatles to play on Sheridan\'s records their contract with them stipulated that the four Beatles (Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Best) were insured to play on a minimum of two songs.', u"Of the seven songs recorded during Sheridan's two-day-long sessions for Polydor in June 1961, it should be pointed out that at times the band behind Sheridan would be down to only two Beatles, and that conversely only on their two solo songs do all four Beatles play (minus Sheridan), while Sheridan plays on all of his tracks.", u"John Lennon's rhythm guitar is heard only on the two Beatle solo tracks (though his voice is heard in background vocals on Sheridan's tracks).", u'These sessions produced Sheridan\'s "My Bonnie" and "The Saints", and the Beatles\' "Ain\'t She Sweet" and "Cry for a Shadow" (formerly titled "Beatle Bop"), plus three other songs.', u"Polydor's beliefs in Sheridan's coming stardom were so strong that they buried the two solo Beatle tracks until much later.", u'Both John Lennon and Tony Sheridan swore that there were several other Beatle tracks that were recorded during the two-day session, but they have not resurfaced.', u'In 1962, after a series of singles (the first of which, "My Bonnie"/"The Saints" made it to number 5 in the German chart), the record was released in America on Decca with a black label and also in a pink label for demo play.', u'The record has the distinction of being one of the most expensive collectible 45 rpm with the black label in mint condition selling for $15,000 in 2007 and the pink label selling for $3000.', u"Ringo Starr briefly played in Sheridan's backing band during very early 1962, before returning to Rory Storm and the Hurricanes.", u"Starr was reportedly unhappy with Sheridan performing songs he had not rehearsed with his band (other musicians made the same complaint, as well as about Sheridan's penchant for fist-fights).", u'Also in 1962, Polydor released the album My Bonnie across Germany.', u'The word "Beatles" was judged to sound too similar to the Hamburgisch dialect word "Pidels" (pronounced "peedles"), the plural of a slang term for penis, hence the album was credited to "Tony Sheridan and the Beat Brothers".', u'Amusingly, that very unintentional-naughty-pun was one thing that so many young German fans had found amusing but enchanting.', u'After the Beatles had gained fame, the album was re-released in the United Kingdom, with the credit altered to "Tony Sheridan and the Beatles".', u"The Beatles' Hamburg studio recordings, as well as some live recordings from the same period, have been reissued many times.", u"In the mid-1960s, Sheridan's musical style underwent a drastic transformation, away from his rock and roll roots and towards a more blues- and jazz-oriented sound.", u'Though these recordings were praised by some, many fans of his earlier work felt wildly disappointed.', u'This change was presaged by liner notes from his 1964 album Just a Little Bit of Tony Sheridan in which his musical preferences are listed as "jazz and classical" rather than rock.', u'The liner notes also mention his wanting to visit the southern US "to hear at first hand the original negro music and experience the atmosphere that has been instrumental in creating negro jazz and the spiritual, for which he has a great liking."', u'Polydor continued releasing Sheridan singles through 1966 (though they only ever released two albums by him).', u'By 1967, Sheridan had become disillusioned with his Beatle-brought fame.', u'As he was more concerned by the Vietnam War and the thought of further Communist aggression, as such Sheridan agreed to perform for the Allied troops.', u'While in Vietnam however, the band that he had assembled was fired upon and one of the members was killed.', u'For his work entertaining the Allies, Sheridan was made an honorary Captain of the United States Army.', u'Due to the repeated shellings encountered there, Sheridan henceforth suffered a great sensitivity to the sounds of any kind of explosions, even fireworks.', u'With his Polydor contract gone Sheridan did what he could to survive.', u"In the early '70's he managed to cut a single as a pop duo teamed with Carole Bell, and they toured Europe together with fair success.", u'Following that phase he returned to playing in Germany (usually Hamburg) or London.', u'The mid-1970s, saw him deejaying a West German radio programme of blues music, which was well received.', u'Somehow he then managed to record an entire live album of early rock classics, a number of which had been part of his and the young Beatles early live act but of which had never gotten recorded.', u"Fortuitously in 1978 a record producer in America heard Sheridan's early Polydor recordings (with and without the young Beatles), and was enthralled by Tony's singing and playing.", u'Immediately Sheridan was offered and wisely accepted the offer to come and record a whole studio album in Los Angeles.', u"Making the entire thing sweeter was the fact that Elvis' (now out of work) TCB Band was hired to play on the album along with top bassist (and former Hamburg friend) Klaus Voormann.", u'A fine album of rock classics plus a few country tunes resulted, but with no major label release, it was doomed to direct TV sales.', u'Thus the possible prospect of a long American career in Las Vegas evaporated.', u"In 1978, the Star Club was reopened, and Sheridan performed there along with Elvis Presley's TCB Band.", u"In 1991, Joe Sunseri, Sheridan biographer and then-manager, completed Nobody's Child: The Tony Sheridan Story.", u'However, due to a falling-out, the biography remained unpublished.', u'A biography of Sheridan, titled The Teacher (ISBN 0957528507), was eventually published in 2013 by Norfolk author Alan Mann, a childhood-friend of Sheridan.', u'This book was essentially an email question and answer interview.', u"While repeated probings by the author did bring out Sheridan's one time of two weeks spent in an English jail, aside from that the author unfortunately takes Sheridan's memory of things at total face value.", u'On 13 August 2002, Sheridan released Vagabond, a collection largely of his own material, but also including a new cover version of "Skinny Minnie", a song he had years earlier recorded for his first album.', u'Tony played guitar and sang for the Argentinian rock musician Charly Garcia.', u'The album was called Influencia and it was released in 2002.', u'In 2015, Colin "Melander" Crawley - Sheridan\'s former bassist, published another biography, Tony Sheridan - The One The Beatles Called "The Teacher".', u"Of the two published biographies it definitely gives the most insight into Sheridan's major career of the early '60's.", u'== Other ==\nSheridan lived in Seesterm\xfche, a village north of Hamburg, and in addition to music, in his later life he was interested in heraldry and designed coats of arms.', u"Sheridan was extremely secretive about his personal life though it's known that he was married three times, lastly to the very young Anna Sievers, and previously to Rosi Heitmann and to Hazel Byng.", u'His friend and former bassist Colin "Melander" Crawley stated that in 1960 Sheridan confided that (despite his mixed Irish-Catholic and Jewish background) he was at that point viewing himself as a Buddhist.', u"Later in life Sheridan became a fervently devoted follower of the Hindu guru Bhagwan Sri Rajneesh (and lived for a while in the commune in the Pacific northwest in the '80's).", u'== Death ==\nTony Sheridan died on 16 February 2013 in Hamburg, after undergoing heart surgery.', u'== Discography ==\n1961: My Bonnie with The Beat Brothers (later corrected to read with The Beatles)\n1962: single "Ich Lieb\' Dich So

a rare LP on Philips.', u'As noted Sheridan is credited as "Dan Sherry" though HIS PICTURE is very clearly displayed on the front cover singing at \'The Star Club\' (with bassist Colin "Melander"

{'sentences': [u'The United States Marine Corps (USMC) is a branch of the United States Armed Forces responsible for providing power projection, using the mobility of the United States Navy, by Congressional mandate, to deliver rapidly, combined-arms task forces on land, at sea, and in the air.', u'The U.S. Marine Corps is one of the four armed service branches in the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States.', u'The current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the highest-ranking military officer in the U.S. armed forces, is a Marine Corps general.', u'The Marine Corps has been a component of the U.S. Department of the Navy since 30 June 1834, working closely with naval forces for training, transportation, and logistics.', u'The USMC operates posts on land and aboard sea-going amphibious warfare ships around the world.', u"Additionally, several of the Marines' tactical aviation squadrons, primarily Marine Fighter Attack squadrons, are also embedded in Navy carrier air wings and operate from the Navy's nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.", u'Two battalions of Continental Marines were formed on 10 November 1775 in Philadelphia as a service branch of infantry troops capable of fighting for independence both at sea and on shore.', u'The role of the Corps has since grown and evolved, expanding to aerial warfare and earning popular titles such as, "America\'s third air force", and, "second land army".', u'The United States Marine Corps has distinguished itself as it has served in the majority of American wars and armed conflicts, from its inception to the modern era, and attained prominence in the 20th century when its theories and practices of amphibious warfare proved prescient and ultimately formed the cornerstone of the Pacific theater of World War II.', u"By the mid-20th century, the U.S. Marine Corps had become a major theorist of and the world's dominant practitioner of amphibious warfare.", u'Its ability to rapidly respond on short notice to expeditionary crises gives it a strong role in the implementation and execution of American foreign policy.', u'As of 2016, the USMC has around 182,000 active duty members and some 38,500 reserve Marines.', u'It is the smallest of the U.S. Armed Forces within the U.S. DoD.', u'== Mission ==\nThe USMC serves as an expeditionary force-in-readiness.', u'As outlined in 10 U.S.C.', u'\xa7 5063 and as originally introduced under the National Security Act of 1947, it has three primary areas of responsibility:\nThe seizure or defense of advanced naval bases and other land operations to support naval campaigns;\nThe development of tactics, technique, and equipment used by amphibious landing forces in coordination with the Army and Air Force; and\nSuch other duties as the President may direct.', u"This last clause, while seemingly redundant given the President's position as Commander-in-chief, is a codification of the expeditionary responsibilities of the Marine Corps.", u'It derives from similar language in the Congressional acts "For the Better Organization of the Marine Corps" of 1834, and "Establishing and Organizing a Marine Corps" of 1798.', u'In 1951, the House of Representatives\' Armed Services Committee called the clause "one of the most important statutory \u2013 and traditional \u2013 functions of the Marine Corps."', u'It noted that the Corps has more often than not performed actions of a non-naval nature, including its famous actions in Tripoli, the War of 1812, Chapultepec, and numerous counter-insurgency and occupational duties (such as those in Central America), World War I, and the Korean War.', u'While these actions are not accurately described as support of naval campaigns nor as amphibious warfare, their common thread is that they are of an expeditionary nature, using the mobility of the Navy to provide timely intervention in foreign affairs on behalf of American interests.', u'In addition to its primary duties, the Marine Corps conducts Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure (VBSS) operations, as well as missions in direct support of the White House and the State Department.', u'The Marine Band, dubbed the "President\'s Own" by Thomas Jefferson, provides music for state functions at the White House.', u'Marines from Ceremonial Companies A & B, quartered in Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C., guard presidential retreats, including Camp David, and the Marines of the Executive Flight Detachment of HMX-1 provide helicopter transport to the President and Vice President, with the radio call signs "Marine One" and "Marine Two", respectively.', u'The Executive Flight Detachment also provides helicopter transport to Cabinet members and other VIPs.', u'By authority of the 1946 Foreign Service Act, the Marine Security Guards of the Marine Embassy Security Command provide security for American embassies, legations, and consulates at more than 140 posts worldwide.', u'The relationship between the Department of State and the U.S. Marine Corps is nearly as old as the corps itself.', u'For over 200 years, Marines have served at the request of various Secretaries of State.', u'After World War II, an alert, disciplined force was needed to protect American embassies, consulates, and legations throughout the world.', u'In 1947, a proposal was made that the Department of War furnish Marine Corps personnel for Foreign Service guard duty under the provisions of the Foreign Service Act of 1946.', u'A formal Memorandum of Agreement was signed between the Department of State and the Secretary of the Navy on December 15, 1948, and 83 Marines were deployed to overseas missions.', u'During the first year of the MSG program, 36 detachments were deployed worldwide.', u"=== Historical mission ===\nThe Marine Corps was founded to serve as an infantry unit aboard naval vessels and was responsible for the security of the ship and its crew by conducting offensive and defensive combat during boarding actions and defending the ship's officers from mutiny; to the latter end, their quarters on ship were often strategically positioned between the officers' quarters and the rest of the vessel.", u'Continental Marines manned raiding parties, both at sea and ashore.', u"America's first amphibious assault landing occurred early in the Revolutionary War on 3 March 1776 as the Marines gained control of Fort Montague and Fort Nassau, a British ammunition depot and naval port in New Providence, the Bahamas.", u'The role of the Marine Corps has expanded significantly since then; as the importance of its original naval mission declined with changing naval warfare doctrine and the professionalization of the naval service, the Corps adapted by focusing on formerly secondary missions ashore.', u'The Advanced Base Doctrine of the early 20th century codified their combat duties ashore, outlining the use of Marines in the seizure of bases and other duties on land to support naval campaigns.', u'Throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries, Marine detachments served aboard Navy cruisers, battleships and aircraft carriers.', u"Marine detachments (generally one platoon per cruiser, a company for battleships or carriers) served in their traditional duties as a ship's landing force, manning the ship's weapons and providing shipboard security.", u"Marine detachments were augmented by members of the ship's company for landing parties, such as in the First Sumatran Expedition of 1832, and continuing in the Caribbean and Mexican campaigns of the early 20th centuries.", u'Marines would develop tactics and techniques of amphibious assault on defended coastlines in time for use in World War II.', u'During World War II, Marines continued to serve on capital ships.', u'They often were assigned to man anti-aircraft batteries.', u'When gun cruisers were retired by the 1960s, the remaining Marine detachments were only seen on battleships and carriers.', u'Its original mission of providing shipboard security finally ended in the 1990s as the battleships were retired and nuclear weapons were withdrawn from deployment on aircraft carriers.', u'=== Capabilities ===\n\nThe Marine Corps fulfills a vital role in national security as an amphibious, expeditionary, air-ground combined arms task force, capable of forcible entry from the air, land, and sea.', u'It is capable of asymmetric warfare with conventional, irregular, and hybrid forces.', u'While the Marine Corps does not employ any unique combat arms, as a force it can rapidly deploy a combined-arms task force to almost anywhere in the world within days.', u'The basic structure for all deployed units is a Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) that integrates a ground combat element, an aviation combat element and a logistics combat element under a common command element.', u"While the creation of joint commands under the Goldwater\u2013Nichols Act has improved inter-service coordination between each branch, the Corps' ability to permanently maintain integrated multi-element task forces under a single command provides a smoother implementation of combined-arms warfare principles.", u'The close integration of disparate Marine units stems from an organizational culture centered on the infantry.', u'Every other Marine capability exists to support the infantry.', u'Unlike some Western militaries, the Corps remained conservative against theories proclaiming the ability of new weapons to win wars independently.', u'For example, Marine aviation has always been focused on close air support and has remained largely uninfluenced by air power theories proclaiming that strategic bombing can single-handedly win wars.', u'This focus on the infantry is matched with the doctrine of "Every Marine [is] a rifleman", a focus of Commandant Alfred M. Gray, Jr., emphasizing the infantry combat abilities of every Marine.', u'All Marines, regardless of military specialization, receive training as a rifleman; and all officers receive additional training as infantry platoon commanders.', u'For example, at Wake Island, when all of the Marine aircraft were shot down, pilots continued the fight as ground officers, leading supply clerks and cooks in a final defensive effort.', u'As a result, a large degree of initiative and autonomy is expected of junior Marines, particularly the NCOs (corporals and sergeants), as compared with many other military organizations.', u'The Marine Corps emphasizes authority and responsibility downward to a greater degree than the other military services.', u'Flexibility of execution is implemented via an emphasis on "commander\'s intent" as a guiding principle for carrying out orders; specifying the end state but leaving open the method of execution.', u'The amphibious assault techniques developed for World War II evolved, with the addition of air assault and maneuver warfare doctrine, into the current "Operational Maneuver from the Sea" doctrine of power projection from the seas.', u'The Marines are credited with the development of helicopter insertion doctrine and were the earliest in the American military to widely adopt maneuver-warfare principles which emphasize low-level initiative and flexible execution.', u"In light of recent warfare that has strayed from the Corps' traditional missions, it has renewed an emphasis on amphibious capabilities.", u'The Marine Corps relies on the Navy for sealift to provide its rapid deployment capabilities.', u'In addition to basing a third of the Fleet Marine Force in Japan, Marine Expeditionary Units (MEU) are typically stationed at sea.', u'This allows the ability to function as first responders to international incidents.', u'The United States Army maintains light infantry units capable of rapid worldwide deployment, but those units do not match the combined-arms integration of an MAGTF and lack the logistics that the Navy provides.', u'Therefore, the Marine Corps is often assigned to non-combat missions such as the evacuation of Americans from unstable countries and providing humanitarian relief during natural disasters.', u'In larger conflicts, Marines act as a stopgap, to get into and hold an area until larger units can be mobilized.', u'The Corps performed this role in World War I and the Korean War, where Marines were the first significant combat units deployed from the United States and held the line until the country could mobilize for war.', u'To aid rapid deployment, the Maritime Pre-Positioning System was developed: fleets of container ships are positioned throughout the world with enough equipment and supplies for a Marine Expeditionary Force to deploy for 30 days.', u'The USMC is planning to reduce its logistical requirements and by 2025 eliminate all liquid fuel use for Marine Expeditionary Forces, except for highly efficient vehicles.', u'=== Doctrine ===\nTwo small manuals published during the 1930s would establish USMC doctrine in two areas.', u'The Small Wars Manual laid the framework for Marine counter-insurgency operations from Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan while the Tentative Landing Operations Manual established the doctrine for the amphibious operations of World War II.', u'"Operational Maneuver from the Sea" is the current doctrine of power projection.', u'== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nThe United States Marine Corps traces its institutional roots to the Continental Marines of the American Revolutionary War, formed by Captain Samuel Nicholas by a resolution of the Second Continental Congress on 10 November 1775, to raise two battalions of Marines.', u"That date is regarded and celebrated as the date of the Marine Corps' birthday.", u'At the end of the American Revolution, both the Continental Navy and Continental Marines were disbanded in April 1783.', u'The institution itself would not be resurrected until 11 July 1798.', u'At that time, in preparation for the Quasi-War with France, Congress created the United States Marine Corps.', u'Marines had been enlisted by the War Department as early as August 1797 for service in the new-build frigates authorized by the Congressional "Act to provide a Naval Armament" of 18 March 1794, which specified the numbers of Marines to be recruited for each frigate.', u"The Marines' most famous action of this period occurred during the First Barbary War (1801\u20131805) against the Barbary pirates, when William Eaton and First Lieutenant Presley O'Bannon led eight Marines and 500 mercenaries in an effort to capture Tripoli.", u"Though they only reached Derna, the action at Tripoli has been immortalized in the Marines' hymn and the Mameluke Sword carried by Marine officers.", u'During the War of 1812, Marine naval detachments took part in some of the great frigate duels that characterized the war, which were the first and last engagements of the conflict.', u"Their most significant contribution, however, was holding the center of General Jackson's defensive line at the Battle of New Orleans, the final major battle and most one-sided engagement of the war.", u'With widespread news of the battle and the capture of the HMS Cyane, HMS Levant and HMS Penguin, the final engagements between British and American forces, the Marines had acquired a well-deserved reputation as expert marksmen, especially in defensive and ship-to-ship actions.', u'After the war, the Marine Corps fell into a malaise that ended with the appointment of Archibald Henderson as its fifth Commandant in 1820.', u'Under his tenure, the Corps took on expeditionary duties in the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, Key West, West Africa, the Falkland Islands, and Sumatra.', u"Commandant Henderson is credited with thwarting President Jackson's attempts to combine and integrate the Marine Corps with the Army.", u'Instead, Congress passed the Act for the Better Organization of the Marine Corps in 1834, stipulating that the Corps was part of the Department of the Navy as a sister service to the Navy.', u'This would be the first of many times that the existence of the Corps was challenged.', u'Commandant Henderson volunteered the Marines for service in the Seminole Wars of 1835, personally leading nearly half of the entire Corps (two battalions) to war.', u'A decade later, in the Mexican\u2013American War (1846\u20131848), the Marines made their famed assault on Chapultepec Palace in Mexico City, which would be later celebrated by the phrase "From The Halls of Montezuma" in Marines\' hymn.', u"In the 1850s, the Marines would see further service in Panama and Asia, escorting Matthew Perry's East India Squadron on its historic trip to the Far East.", u'With their vast service in foreign engagements, the Marine Corps played a moderate role in the Civil War (1861\u20131865); their most prominent task was blockade duty.', u"As more and more states seceded from the Union, about a third of the Corps' officers left the Union to join the Confederacy and form the Confederate States Marine Corps, which ultimately played little part in the war.", u'The battalion of recruits formed for the First Battle of Bull Run (First Manassas) performed poorly, retreating with the rest of the Union forces.', u'Blockade duty included sea-based amphibious operations to secure forward bases.', u'In late November 1861, Marines and sailors landed a reconnaissance in force from the USS Flag at Tybee Island, Georgia, to occupy the Lighthouse and Martello Tower on the northern end of the island.', u'It would later be the Army base for bombardment of Fort Pulaski.', u'=== American Civil War to World War I ===\nThe remainder of the 19th century was marked by declining strength and introspection about the mission of the Marine Corps.', u"The Navy's transition from sail to steam put into question the need for Marines on naval ships.", u'Meanwhile, Marines served as a convenient resource for interventions and landings to protect American lives and interests overseas.', u'The Corps was involved in over 28 separate interventions in the 30 years from the end of the American Civil War to the end of 19th century, with 148 U.S. Marines killed in action fighting against the Confederates in the U.S. Civil War.', u'They would be called upon to stem political and labor unrest within the United States.', u"Under Commandant Jacob Zeilin's tenure, Marine customs and traditions took shape: the Corps adopted the Marine Corps emblem on 19 November 1868.", u'It was during this time that "The Marines\' Hymn" was first heard.', u'Around 1883, the Marines adopted their current motto "Semper Fidelis" (Always Faithful).', u'John Philip Sousa, the musician and composer, enlisted as a Marine apprentice at the age of 13, serving from 1867 until 1872, and again from 1880 to 1892 as the leader of the Marine Band.', u'During the Spanish\u2013American War (1898), Marines led American forces ashore in the Philippines, Cuba, and Puerto Rico, demonstrating their readiness for deployment.', u'At Guant\xe1namo Bay, Cuba, the Marines seized an advanced naval base that remains in use today.', u'Between 1899 and 1916, the Corps continued its record of vigorous participation in foreign expeditions, including the Philippine\u2013American War, the Boxer Rebellion in China (1899\u20131901), Panama, the Cuban Pacifications, the Perdicaris Incident in Morocco, Veracruz, Santo Domingo, and the Banana Wars in Haiti and Nicaragua; the experiences gained in counter-insurgency and guerrilla operations during this period were consolidated into the Small Wars Manual.', u'=== World War I ===\n\nDuring World War I veteran Marines served a central role in the late American entry into the conflict, on 6 April 1917.', u'The Marine Corps had a deep pool of officers and NCOs with battle experience, and experienced a small expansion.', u"During the war, the Marines, fighting on the Western Front in France, fought their famed battle at Belleau Wood, creating the Marines' reputation in modern history.", u"While its previous expeditionary experiences had not earned it much acclaim in the Western world, the Marines' ferocity and toughness in France earned them the respect of the Germans.", u'Though Marines and American media reported that Germans had nicknamed them Teufel Hunden as meaning "Devil Dogs", for their reputation as shock troops and marksmen at ranges up to 900 meters, there is no evidence of this in German records (as Teufelshunde would be the proper German phrase).', u'Nevertheless, the name stuck.', u'The Corps entered the war with 511 officers and 13,214 enlisted personnel, and by 11 November 1918 had reached a strength of 2,400 officers and 70,000 enlisted.', u'African-Americans were entirely excluded from the Marine Corps during this conflict.', u'Opha May Johnson was the first woman to enlist in the Marines; she joined the Marine Corps Reserve in 1918 during World War I, officially becoming the first female Marine.', u'From then until the end of World War I, 305 women enlisted in the Corps.', u'Between the World Wars, the Marine Corps was headed by Commandant John A. Lejeune, and under his leadership, the Corps presciently studied and developed amphibious techniques that would be of great use in World War II.', u'Many officers, including Lieutenant Colonel Earl Hancock "Pete" Ellis, foresaw a war in the Pacific with Japan and undertook preparations for such a conflict.', u'Through 1941, as the prospect of war grew, the Corps pushed urgently for joint amphibious exercises and acquired amphibious equipment that would prove of great use in the upcoming conflict.', u'=== World War II ===\n\n.', u'In World War II, the Marines played a central role in the Pacific War.', u'The battles of Guadalcanal, Bougainville, Tarawa, Guam, Tinian, Cape Gloucester, Saipan, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa saw fierce fighting between Marines and the Imperial Japanese Army.', u'The island of Iwo Jima served as the next area of battle, which began on 19 February 1945.', u'The Japanese had learned from their defeats in the Marianas campaign and prepared many fortified positions on the island, including pillboxes and underground tunnels.', u'The Japanese put up fierce resistance, but American forces reached the summit of Mount Suribachi on 23 February.', u'The mission was accomplished at very high losses, with 26,000 American casualties and 22,000 Japanese.', u'By the end of the war, the Corps expanded from two brigades to six divisions, five air wings, and supporting troops, totaling about 485,000 Marines.', u'In addition, 20 defense battalions and a parachute battalion were set raised.', u'Nearly 87,000 Marines were casualties during World War II (including nearly 20,000 killed), and 82 were awarded the Medal of Honor.', u"Despite Secretary Forrestal's prediction, the Corps faced an immediate institutional crisis following the war due to the low budget.", u'Army generals pushing for a strengthened and reorganized defense establishment attempted to fold the Marine mission and assets into the Navy and Army.', u'Drawing on hastily assembled Congressional support, and with the assistance of the so-called "Revolt of the Admirals", the Marine Corps rebuffed such efforts to dismantle the Corps, resulting in statutory protection of the Marine Corps in the National Security Act of 1947.', u'Shortly afterward, in 1952 the Douglas\u2013Mansfield Act afforded the Commandant an equal voice with the Joint Chiefs of Staff on matters relating to the Marines and established the structure of three active divisions and air wings that remain today.', u'=== Korean War ===\n\nThe Korean War (1950\u20131953) saw the hastily formed Provisional Marine Brigade holding the defensive line at the Pusan Perimeter.', u'To execute a flanking maneuver, General Douglas MacArthur called on Marine air and ground forces to make an amphibious landing at Inchon.', u"The successful landing resulted in the collapse of North Korean lines and the pursuit of North Korean forces north near the Yalu River until the entrance of the People's Republic of China into the war.", u'Chinese troops surrounded, surprised and overwhelmed the overextended and outnumbered American forces.', u"X Corps, which included the 1st Marine Division and the Army's 7th Infantry Division, regrouped and inflicted heavy casualties during their fighting withdrawal to the coast, now known as the Battle of Chosin Reservoir.", u'The fighting calmed after the Battle of the Chosin Reservoir, but late in March 1953 the relative quiet of the war was broken when the Chinese Army launched a massive offensive on three outposts manned by the 5th Marine Regiment.', u'These outposts were codenamed "Reno", "Vegas", and "Carson".', u'The campaign was collectively known as the Nevada Cities Campaign.', u'There was brutal fighting on Reno hill, which was eventually captured by the Chinese.', u'Although Reno was lost, the 5th Marines held both Vegas and Carson through the rest of the campaign.', u'In this one campaign, the Marines suffered approximately 1,000 casualties, while the Chinese suffered at least twice as many.', u'Marines would continue a battle of attrition around the 38th Parallel until the 1953 armistice.', u'The Korean War saw the Corps expand from 75,000 regulars to a force of 261,000 Marines, mostly reservists.', u'30,544 Marines were killed or wounded during the war and 42 were awarded the Medal of Honor.', u'=== Vietnam War ===\n\nThe Marine Corps served an important role in the Vietnam War taking part in such battles as the Battle of Hue and the Battle of Khe Sanh in 1968.', u'Individuals from the USMC generally operated in the Northern I Corps Regions of South Vietnam.', u'While there, they were constantly engaged in a guerrilla war against the Viet Cong, along with an intermittent conventional war against the North Vietnamese Army (NVA).', u'Portions of the Corps were responsible for the less-known Combined Action Program (CAP) that implemented unconventional techniques for counter-insurgency and worked as military advisers to the Republic of Vietnam Marine Corps.', u'Marines were withdrawn in 1971, and returned briefly in 1975 to evacuate Saigon and attempt a rescue of the crew of the Mayag\xfcez.', u'Vietnam was the longest war for Marines; by its end, 13,091 had been killed in action, 51,392 had been wounded, and 57 Medals of Honor had been awarded.', u'Due to policies concerning rotation, more Marines were deployed for service during Vietnam than World War II.', u'While recovering from Vietnam, the Corps hit a detrimental low point in its service history caused by courts-martial and non-judicial punishments related partially to increased unauthorized absences and desertions during the war.', u'Overhauling of the Corps began in the late 1970s, discharging the most delinquent, and once quality of new recruits improved, the Corps focused on reforming the NCO Corps, a vital functioning part of its forces.', u'=== Interim: Vietnam War to the War on Terrorism ===\n\nAfter the Vietnam War, the U.S. Marines resumed their expeditionary role, participating in the failed 1980 Iran hostage rescue attempt Operation Eagle Claw, the invasion of Grenada (Operation Urgent Fury) and the invasion of Panama (Operation Just Cause).', u'On 23 October 1983, the Marine headquarters building in Beirut, Lebanon, was bombed, causing the highest peacetime losses to the Corps in its history (220 Marines and 21 other service members were killed) and leading to the American withdrawal from the country.', u'The year 1990 saw Marines of the Joint Task Force Sharp Edge save thousands of lives by evacuating British, French and American nationals from the violence of the Liberian Civil War.', u'During the Gulf War (1990\u20131991), Marine task forces formed the initial core for Operation Desert Shield, while United States and Coalition troops mobilized, and later liberated Kuwait in Operation Desert Storm.', u'Marines participated in combat operations in Somalia (1992\u20131995) during Operations Restore Hope, Restore Hope II, and United Shield to provide humanitarian relief.', u'In 1997, Marines took part in Operation Silver Wake, the evacuation of American citizens from the US Embassy in Tirana, Albania.', u'=== Global War on Terrorism ===\n\nFollowing the attacks on 11 September 2001, President George W. Bush announced the Global War on Terrorism.', u'The stated objective of the Global War on Terror is "the defeat of Al-Qaeda, other terrorist groups and any nation that supports or harbors terrorists."', u'Since then, the Marine Corps, alongside other military and federal agencies, has engaged in global operations around the world in support of that mission.', u"In spring 2009, President Barack Obama's goal of reducing spending in the Defense Department was led by Secretary Robert Gates in a series of budget cuts which did not result in significant changes in the Corps' budget and programs, cutting only the VH-71 Kestrel and resetting the VXX program.", u'However, the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform singled the Corps out for the brunt of a series of recommended cuts in late 2010.', u'In light of budget sequestration in 2013, commandant Amos set a goal of a force of 174,000 Marines.', u'He testified that this was the minimum number that would allow for an effective response to even a single contingency operation, but it would reduce the peacetime ratio of time at home bases to time deployed down to a historical low level.', u'==== Afghanistan Campaign (Operation Enduring Freedom-Afghanistan) ====\n\nMarines and other American forces began staging in Pakistan and Uzbekistan on the border of Afghanistan as early as October 2001 in preparation for Operation Enduring Freedom.', u'The 15th and 26th Marine Expeditionary Units were the first conventional forces into Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in November 2001, and in December, the Marines seized Kandahar International Airport.', u'Since then, Marine battalions and squadrons have been rotating through, engaging Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces.', u'Marines of the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit flooded into the Taliban-held town of Garmsir on 29 April 2008, in Helmand Province, in the first major American operation in the region in years.', u'In June 2009, 7,000 Marines with the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade deployed to Afghanistan in an effort to improve security, and began Operation Strike of the Sword the next month.', u'In February 2010, the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade launched the largest offensive of the Afghan Campaign since 2001, the Battle of Marjah, to clear the Taliban from their key stronghold in Helmand Province.', u'After Marjah, Marines progressed north up the Helmand River and cleared the towns of Kajahki and Sangin.', u'Marines remained in Helmand Province until 2014.', u"==== Iraq Campaign (Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation New Dawn, Operation Inherent Resolve) ====\n\nThe U.S. Marines served prominently in the Iraq War's Operation Iraqi Freedom.", u"The I Marine Expeditionary Force, along with the U.S. Army's 3rd Infantry Division, spearheaded the 2003 invasion of Iraq.", u'The Marines left Iraq in the summer of 2003, but returned for occupation duty in the beginning of 2004.', u'They were given responsibility for the Al Anbar Province, the large desert region to the west of Baghdad.', u"During this occupation, the Marines spearheaded both assaults on the city of Fallujah in April (Operation Vigilant Resolve) and November 2004 (Operation Phantom Fury) and saw intense fighting in such places as Ramadi, Al-Qa'im and H\u012bt.", u'Their time in Iraq has courted controversy with the Haditha killings and the Hamdania incident.', u'The Anbar Awakening and 2007 surge reduced levels of violence.', u'On 1 March 2009, at Camp Lejeune, President Obama announced an accelerated withdrawal, promising all troops out by August 2010.', u'The Marine Corps officially ended its role in Iraq on 23 January 2010 when they handed over responsibility for Al Anbar Province to the United States Army.', u'US Marines would ultimately return to Iraq in the summer of 2014, in response to growing violence there.', u'Horn of Africa Operations\nThroughout the Global War on Terrorism, the US Marines have supported operations in Africa to counter Islamic extremism and piracy in the Red Sea.', u'In late 2002, Combined Joint Task Force \u2013 Horn of Africa was stood up at Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti to provide regional security.', u'Despite transferring overall command to the Navy in 2006, the Marines continued to operate in the Horn of Africa into 2007.', u'See Operation Enduring Freedom- Horn of Africa.', u'== Organization ==\n\n\n=== Department of the Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps ===\nThe Department of the Navy, led by the Secretary of the Navy, is the service-level department of the cabinet-level U.S. Department of Defense that oversees the Marine Corps and the Navy.', u'The most senior Marine officer is the Commandant, responsible to the Secretary of the Navy for organizing, recruiting, training, and equipping the Marine Corps so that its forces are ready for deployment under the operational command of the Combatant Commanders.', u'The Marine Corps is organized into four principal subdivisions: Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC), the Operating Forces, the Supporting Establishment, and the Marine Forces Reserve (MARFORRES or USMCR).', u'=== Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC) ===\nHeadquarters Marine Corps consists of the Commandant of the Marine Corps, the Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps, the Director Marine Corps Staff, the several Deputy Commandants, the Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps, and various special staff officers and Marine Corps agency heads that report directly to either the Commandant or Assistant Commandant.', u'HQMC is supported by the Headquarters and Service Battalion, USMC providing administrative, supply, logistics, training, and services support to the Commandant and his staff.', u'=== Operating Forces ===\nThe Operating Forces are divided into three categories: Marine Corps Forces (MARFOR) assigned to unified commands (viz., the Fleet Marine Forces (FMF), Security Forces guarding high-risk naval installations, and Security Guard detachments at American embassies.', u'Under the "Forces for Unified Commands" memo, in accordance with the Unified Command Plan approved by the President, Marine Corps Forces are assigned to each of the Combatant Commands at the discretion of the Secretary of Defense.', u'Since 1991, the Marine Corps has maintained component headquarters at each of the regional unified combatant commands.', u'Marine Corps Forces are divided into Forces Command (MARFORCOM) and Pacific Command (MARFORPAC), each headed by a Lieutenant General dual-posted as the commanding general of either FMF Atlantic (FMFLANT) or FMF Pacific (FMFPAC), respectively.', u'MARFORCOM/FMFLANT has operational control of the II Marine Expeditionary Force; MARFORPAC/FMFPAC has operational control of the I Marine Expeditionary Force and III Marine Expeditionary Force.', u'==== Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) ====\n\nThe basic framework for deployable Marine units is the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF), a flexible structure of varying size.', u'A MAGTF integrates a ground combat element (GCE), an aviation combat element (ACE), and a logistics combat element (LCE) under a common command element (CE), capable of operating independently or as part of a larger coalition.', u'The MAGTF structure reflects a strong tradition in the Corps towards self-sufficiency and a commitment to combined arms, both essential assets to an expeditionary force often called upon to act independently in discrete, time-sensitive situations.', u'The history of the Marine Corps as well has led to a wariness of over reliance on its sister services, and towards joint operations in general.', u'=== Supporting Establishment ===\nThe Supporting Establishment includes the Combat Development Command, the Logistics Command, the Systems Command, the Recruiting Command, the Installations Command, and the Marine Band.', u'==== Marine Corps bases and stations ====\n\nThe Marine Corps operates many major bases, 14 of which host operating forces, several support and training installations, as well as satellite facilities.', u"Marine Corps' bases are concentrated around the locations of the Marine Expeditionary Forces, though reserve units are scattered throughout the United States.", u'The principal bases are Camp Pendleton on the West Coast, home to I MEF; Camp Lejeune on the East Coast, home to II MEF; and Camp Butler in Okinawa, Japan, home to III MEF.', u'Other important bases include air stations, recruit depots, logistics bases, and training commands.', u"Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms in California is the Marine Corps' largest base and home to the Corps' most complex, combined-arms, live-fire training.", u'Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia is home to Marine Corps Combat Development Command, and nicknamed the "Crossroads of the Marine Corps".', u'The Marine Corps maintains a significant presence in the National Capital Region, with Headquarters Marine Corps scattered amongst the Pentagon, Henderson Hall, Washington Navy Yard, and Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C. Additionally, Marines operate detachments at many installations owned by other branches, to better share resources, such as specialty schools.', u'Marines are also present at, and operate many, forward bases during expeditionary operations.', u'=== Marine Forces Reserve (MARFORRES/USMCR) ===\nMarine Forces Reserve consists of the Force Headquarters Group, 4th Marine Division, 4th Marine Aircraft Wing, and the 4th Marine Logistics Group.', u'The MARFORRES/USMCR is capable of forming a 4th Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) or reinforcing/augmenting active-duty forces.', u'== Special Operations ==\n\nMarine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC) includes: the Marine Raider Regiment, the Marine Raider Support Group, and the Marine Special Operations School.', u'Both the Raider Regiment and the Raider Support Group consist of a headquarters company and three operations battalions.', u'The Special Operations School conducts screening, assessment, selection, training and development functions for MARSOC units.', u'Marine Corps Special Operations Capable forces include: Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Companies, the Chemical Biological Incident Response Force, the Marine Division Reconnaissance Battalions, Force Reconnaissance Companies, Maritime Special Purpose Force, and Special Reaction Teams.', u'Additionally, all deployed Marine Expeditionary Units are certified as "Special Operations Capable", viz.', u'"MEU(SOC)".', u'Although the notion of a Marine special forces contribution to the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) was considered as early as the founding of USSOCOM in the 1980s, it was resisted by the Marine Corps.', u'Then-Commandant Paul X. Kelley expressed the popular belief that Marines should support Marines, and that the Corps should not fund a special operations capability that would not support Marine operations.', u'However, much of the resistance from within the Corps dissipated when Marine leaders watched the Corps\' 15th and 26th MEU(SOC)s "sit on the sidelines" during the very early stages of Operation Enduring Freedom while other special operations units actively engaged in operations in Afghanistan.', u'After a three-year development period, the Corps agreed in 2006 to supply a 2,500-strong unit, Marine Forces Special Operations Command, which would answer directly to USSOCOM.', u'== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== Leadership ===\n\nAs stated above, the Commandant of the Marine Corps is the highest-ranking officer of the Marine Corps; though he may not be the senior officer by time in grade and/or position of office.', u'He is both the symbolic and functional head of the Corps, and holds a position of very high esteem among Marines.', u'The Commandant has the U.S. Code Title 10 responsibility to man, train, and equip the Marine Corps.', u'He does not serve as a direct battlefield commander.', u'The Commandant is a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and reports to the Secretary of the Navy.', u'The Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps acts as a deputy to the Commandant.', u'The Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps is the senior enlisted Marine, and acts as an adviser to the Commandant.', u"Headquarters Marine Corps comprises the rest of the Commandant's counsel and staff, with deputy Commandants that oversee various aspects of the Corps assets and capabilities.", u'The current and 37th Commandant is Robert Neller, who assumed the position on 30 September 2015.', u'The 33rd and current Assistant Commandant is John M. Paxton, Jr., while the 18th and current Sergeant Major is Ronald L. Green.', u'Other Marine generals may be senior to the Commandant or Assistant Commandant in terms of time in grade and/or billet.', u'=== Rank structure ===\n\nAs in the rest of the United States military, Marine Corps ranks fall into one of three categories: commissioned officer, warrant officer, and enlisted, in decreasing order of authority (excluding the Air Force, which does not currently appoint warrant officers).', u'To standardize compensation, each rank is assigned a pay grade.', u'==== Commissioned officers ====\nCommissioned officers are distinguished from other officers by their commission, which is the formal written authority, issued in the name of the President of the United States, that confers the rank and authority of a Marine officer.', u'Commissioned officers carry the "special trust and confidence" of the President of the United States.', u'Marine Corps commissioned officers are promoted based on an "up or out" system in accordance with the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act of 1980.', u'==== Warrant officers ====\n\nWarrant officers are primarily former enlisted experts in a specific specialized field and provide leadership generally only within that speciality.', u'==== Enlisted ====\nEnlisted Marines in the pay grades E-1 to E-3 make up the bulk of the Corps\' ranks, usually referred to simply as "Marines".', u"Although they do not technically hold leadership ranks, the Corps' ethos stresses leadership among all Marines, and junior Marines are often assigned responsibility normally reserved for superiors.", u'Those in the pay grades of E-4 and E-5 are non-commissioned officers (NCOs).', u'They primarily supervise junior Marines and act as a vital link with the higher command structure, ensuring that orders are carried out correctly.', u'Marines E-6 and higher are Staff Non-Commissioned Officers (SNCOs), charged with supervising NCOs and acting as enlisted advisers to the command.', u'The E-8 and E-9 levels have two and three ranks per pay grade, respectively, each with different responsibilities.', u'The First Sergeant and Sergeant Major ranks are command-oriented, serving as the senior enlisted Marines in a unit, charged to assist the commanding officer in matters of discipline, administration and the morale and welfare of the unit.', u'Master Sergeants and Master Gunnery Sergeants provide technical leadership as occupational specialists in their specific MOS.', u'The Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps also E-9, is a billet conferred on the senior enlisted Marine of the entire Marine Corps, personally selected by the Commandant.', u'It is possible however for an enlisted Marine to hold a position senior to Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps as has been the case since the 2011 appointment of Sergeant Major Bryan B. Battaglia to the billet of Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman which is deemed the senior enlisted member of the United States military.', u'Different forms of address can be found at United States Marine Corps rank insignia and List of United States Marine Corps acronyms and expressions.', u'=== Military Occupational Specialty ===\n\nThe Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) is a system of job classification.', u'Using a four digit code, it designates what field and specific occupation a Marine performs.', u'Segregated between officer and enlisted, the MOS determines the staffing of a unit.', u"Some MOSs change with rank to reflect supervisory positions, others are secondary and represent a temporary assignment outside of a Marine's normal duties or special skill.", u'In late June 2016, it was reported that the Marine Corps will be removing the word "man" from 19 key job titles.', u'For example, Basic Infantryman will change to Basic Infantry Marine.', u'Rifleman was to remain unchanged.', u'=== Initial training ===\n\nEvery year, over 2,000 new Marine officers are commissioned, and 38,000 recruits accepted and trained.', u'All new Marines, enlisted or officer, are recruited by the Marine Corps Recruiting Command.', u'Commissioned officers are commissioned mainly through one of three sources: Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC), Officer Candidates School (OCS), or the United States Naval Academy (USNA).', u'Following commissioning, all Marine commissioned officers, regardless of accession route or further training requirements, attend The Basic School (TBS) at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia.', u'At TBS, second lieutenants, warrant officers, and selected foreign officers learn the art of infantry and combined arms warfare.', u'Enlisted Marines attend recruit training, known as boot camp, at either Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego or Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island.', u'Historically, the Mississippi River served as the dividing line which delineated who would be trained where, while more recently, a district system has ensured a more even distribution of male recruits between the two MCRD facilities.', u'Females attend only the Parris Island depot as part of the segregated Fourth Recruit Training Battalion.', u'All recruits must pass a fitness test to start training; those who fail receive individualized attention and training until the minimum standards are reached.', u"Marine recruit training is the longest among the American military services; it is 13 weeks long including processing and out-processing, compared to the Army's 10 weeks, the Navy's 9 weeks, the Air Forces's 8 1/2 weeks, and the Coast Guard's 8 weeks.", u'Following recruit training, enlisted Marines then attend The School of Infantry at Camp Geiger or Camp Pendleton.', u'Infantry Marines begin their combat training, which varies in length, immediately with the Infantry Training Battalion (ITB).', u'Marines in all other MOSs other than infantry train for 29 days in Marine Combat Training (MCT), learning common infantry skills, before continuing on to their MOS schools which vary in length.', u'== Uniforms ==\n\nThe Marine Corps has the most stable and most recognizable uniforms in the American military; the Blue Dress dates back to the early 19th century and the service uniform to the early 20th century.', u"Marines' uniforms are distinct in their simplicity; Marines do not wear unit patches or United States flags on any of their uniforms, nor name tags on their service and formal uniforms.", u'Only a handful of skills (parachutist, air crew, explosive ordnance disposal, etc.)', u"warrant distinguishing badges, and rank insignia is not worn on uniform headgear (with the exception of an officer's garrison service cover).", u'While other servicemembers commonly identify with a sub-group as much as or more than their service (Ranger, submariner, aircrew, etc.', u'), Marine uniforms do not reflect such division.', u'Marines have four main uniforms: Dress, Service, Utility, and Physical Training (PT).', u'These uniforms have a few minor, but very distinct, variations from enlisted personnel to commissioned and non-commissioned officers.', u'The Marine Corps Dress uniform is the most elaborate, worn for formal or ceremonial occasions.', u'There are four different forms of the Dress uniform.', u'The variations of the dress uniforms are known as "Alphas", "Bravos", "Charlies", or "Deltas".', u'The most common being the "Blue Dress Alphas or Bravos", called "Dress Blues" or simply "Blues".It is most often seen in recruiting advertisements and is equivalent to black tie.', u'There is a "Blue-White" Dress for summer, and Evening Dress for formal (white tie) occasions.', u'Versions with a khaki shirt in lieu of the coat (Blue Dress Charlie/Delta) are worn as a daily working uniform by Marine recruiters and NROTC staff.', u'The Service Uniform was once the prescribed daily work attire in garrison; however, it has been largely superseded in this role by the utility uniform.', u'Consisting of olive green and khaki colors, it is commonly referred to as "Greens".', u'It is roughly equivalent in function and composition to a business suit.', u'The Utility Uniform, currently the Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform, is a camouflage uniform intended for wear in the field or for dirty work in garrison, though it has now been standardized for regular duty.', u"It is rendered in a distinctive MARPAT pixelated camouflage (sometimes referred to as digitals or digies) that breaks up the wearer's shape, and serves to distinguish Marine uniforms from those of other services.", u"In garrison, the woodland and desert uniforms are worn depending on the Marine's duty station.", u'Marines consider the utilities a working uniform and do not permit their wear off-base, except in transit to and from their place of duty and in the event of an emergency.', u'This, too, distinguishes them from other services, which have less stringent restrictions.', u'== Culture ==\n\nAs in any military organization, the official and unofficial traditions of the Marine Corps serve to reinforce camaraderie and set the service apart from others.', u"The Corps' embrace of its rich culture and history is cited as a reason for its high esprit de corps.", u"=== Official traditions and customs ===\nThe Marines' Hymn dates back to the 19th century and is the oldest official song in the United States armed forces.", u'The Marine motto Semper Fidelis means always faithful in Latin, often appearing as Semper Fi; also the name of the official march of the Corps, composed by John Philip Sousa.', u'The mottos "Fortitudine" (With Fortitude); By Sea and by Land, a translation of the Royal Marines\' Per Mare, Per Terram;

continue.', u"Japan exploited Vietnam's natural resources to support its military campaigns, culminating in a full-scale takeover of the country in March 1945 and the Vietnamese Famine of 1945, which caused up to two million deaths.", u'=== 1946\u201354: First Indochina War ===\n\nIn 1941, the Viet Minh \u2013 a communist and nationalist liberation movement \u2013 emerged under the Marxist\u2013Leninist revolutionary Ho Chi Minh, who sought independence for Vietnam from France and the end of the Japanese occupation.', u'Following the military defeat of Japan and the fall of its puppet Empire of Vietnam in August 1945, the Viet Minh occupied Hanoi and proclaimed a provisional government, which asserted national independence on 2 September.', u'In the same year, the Provisional Government of the French Republic sent the French Far East Expeditionary Corps to restore colonial rule, and the Viet Minh began a guerrilla campaign against the French in late 1946.', u'The resulting First Indochina War lasted until July 1954.', u'The defeat of French and Vietnamese loyalists in the 1954 Battle of Dien Bien Phu allowed Ho Chi Minh to negotiate a ceasefire from a favorable position at the subsequent Geneva Conference.', u'The colonial administration was ended and French Indochina was dissolved under the Geneva Accords of 1954, which separated the loyalist forces from the communists at the 17th parallel north with the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone.', u"Two states formed after the partition \u2013 Ho Chi Minh's Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the north and Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i's State of Vietnam in the south.", u'A 300-day period of free movement was permitted, during which almost a million northerners, mainly Catholics, moved south, fearing persecution by the communists.', u'The partition of Vietnam was not intended to be permanent by the Geneva Accords, which stipulated that Vietnam would be reunited after elections in 1956.', u"However, in 1955, the State of Vietnam's Prime Minister, Ng\xf4 \u0110\xecnh Di\u1ec7m, toppled B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i in a fraudulent referendum organised by his brother Ng\xf4 \u0110\xecnh Nhu, and proclaimed himself president of the Republic of Vietnam.", u"=== 1954\u20131975: Vietnam War ===\n\nThe pro-Hanoi Viet Cong began a guerrilla campaign in the late 1950s to overthrow Di\u1ec7m's government.", u'Between 1953 and 1956, the North Vietnamese government instituted various agrarian reforms, including "rent reduction" and "land reform," which resulted in significant political oppression.', u'During the land reform, testimony from North Vietnamese witnesses suggested a ratio of one execution for every 160 village residents, which extrapolated nationwide would indicate nearly 100,000 executions.', u'Because the campaign was concentrated mainly in the Red River Delta area, a lower estimate of 50,000 executions became widely accepted by scholars at the time.', u'However, declassified documents from the Vietnamese and Hungarian archives indicate that the number of executions was much lower than reported at the time, although likely greater than 13,500.', u'In 1960 and 1962, the Soviet Union and North Vietnam signed treaties providing for further Soviet military support.', u'In the South, Di\u1ec7m countered North Vietnamese subversion (including the assassination of over 450 South Vietnamese officials in 1956) by detaining tens of thousands of suspected communists in "political reeducation centers."', u'This was a ruthless program that incarcerated many non-communists, although it was also successful at curtailing communist activity in the country, if only for a time.', u'The North Vietnamese government claimed that 2,148 individuals were killed in the process by November 1957.', u'In 1960 and 1962, the Soviet Union and North Vietnam signed treaties providing for further Soviet military support.', u"In 1963, Buddhist discontent with Di\u1ec7m's regime erupted into mass demonstrations, leading to a violent government crackdown.", u"This led to the collapse of Di\u1ec7m's relationship with the United States, and ultimately to the 1963 coup in which Di\u1ec7m and Nhu were assassinated.", u'The Di\u1ec7m era was followed by more than a dozen successive military governments, before the pairing of Air Marshal Nguy\u1ec5n Cao K\u1ef3 and General Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u took control in mid-1965.', u'Thieu gradually outmaneuvered Ky and cemented his grip on power in fraudulent elections in 1967 and 1971.', u'Under this political instability, the communists began to gain ground.', u"To support South Vietnam's struggle against the communist insurgency, the United States began increasing its contribution of military advisers, using the 1964 Tonkin Gulf incident as a pretext for such intervention.", u'US forces became involved in ground combat operations in 1965, and at their peak they numbered more than 500,000.', u'The US also engaged in a sustained aerial bombing campaign.', u'Meanwhile, China and the Soviet Union provided North Vietnam with significant material aid and 15,000 combat advisers.', u'Communist forces supplying the Viet Cong carried supplies along the Ho Chi Minh trail, which passed through Laos.', u'The communists attacked South Vietnamese targets during the 1968 Tet Offensive.', u'Although the campaign failed militarily, it shocked the American establishment, and turned US public opinion against the war.', u'During the offensive, communist troops massacred over 3,000 civilians at Hue.', u'Facing an increasing casualty count, rising domestic opposition to the war, and growing international condemnation, the US began withdrawing from ground combat roles in the early 1970s.', u'This process also entailed an unsuccessful effort to strengthen and stabilize South Vietnam.', u'Following the Paris Peace Accords of 27 January 1973, all American combat troops were withdrawn by 29 March 1973.', u'In December 1974, North Vietnam captured the province of Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Long and started a full-scale offensive, culminating in the Fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975.', u'South Vietnam was briefly ruled by a provisional government while under military occupation by North Vietnam.', u'On 2 July 1976, North and South Vietnam were merged to form the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.', u'The war left Vietnam devastated, with the total death toll standing at between 800,000 and 3.1 million.', u"=== 1976\u2013present: reunification and reforms ===\n\nIn the aftermath of the war, under L\xea Du\u1ea9n's administration, there were no mass executions of South Vietnamese who had collaborated with the U.S. or the Saigon government, confounding Western fears.", u'However, up to 300,000 South Vietnamese were sent to reeducation camps, where many endured torture, starvation, and disease while being forced to perform hard labor.', u'The government embarked on a mass campaign of collectivization of farms and factories.', u'This caused economic chaos and resulted in triple-digit inflation, while national reconstruction efforts progressed slowly.', u'In 1978, the Vietnamese military invaded Cambodia to remove from power the Khmer Rouge, who had been attacking Vietnamese border villages.', u'Vietnam was victorious, installing a government in Cambodia which ruled until 1989.', u'This action worsened relations with the Chinese, who launched a brief incursion into northern Vietnam in 1979.', u'This conflict caused Vietnam to rely even more heavily on Soviet economic and military aid.', u'At the Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam in December 1986, reformist politicians replaced the "old guard" government with new leadership.', u"The reformers were led by 71-year-old Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Linh, who became the party's new general secretary.", u'Linh and the reformers implemented a series of free-market reforms \u2013 known as \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi ("Renovation") \u2013 which carefully managed the transition from a planned economy to a "socialist-oriented market economy".', u'Though the authority of the state remained unchallenged under \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi, the government encouraged private ownership of farms and factories, economic deregulation and foreign investment, while maintaining control over strategic industries.', u'The Vietnamese economy subsequently achieved strong growth in agricultural and industrial production, construction, exports and foreign investment.', u'However, these reforms have also caused a rise in income inequality and gender disparities.', u"== Government and politics ==\n\nThe Socialist Republic of Vietnam, along with China, Cuba, and Laos, is one of the world's four remaining one-party socialist states officially espousing communism.", u'Its current state constitution, 2013 Constitution, asserts the central role of the Communist Party of Vietnam in all organs of government, politics and society.', u"The General Secretary of the Communist Party performs numerous key administrative and executive functions, controlling the party's national organization and state appointments, as well as setting policy.", u'Only political organizations affiliated with or endorsed by the Communist Party are permitted to contest elections in Vietnam.', u'These include the Vietnamese Fatherland Front and worker and trade unionist parties.', u'Although the state remains officially committed to socialism as its defining creed, its economic policies have grown increasingly capitalist, with The Economist characterizing its leadership as "ardently capitalist communists".', u'=== Legislature ===\nThe National Assembly of Vietnam is the unicameral legislature of the state, composed of 498 members.', u'Headed by a Chairman, it is superior to both the executive and judicial branches, with all government ministers being appointed from members of the National Assembly.', u'=== Executive ===\n\nThe President of Vietnam is the titular head of state and the nominal commander-in-chief of the military, serving as the Chairman of the Council of Supreme Defense and Security.', u'The Prime Minister of Vietnam is the head of government, presiding over a council of ministers composed of three deputy prime ministers and the heads of 26 ministries and commissions.', u"=== Judiciary ===\nThe Supreme People's Court of Vietnam, headed by a Chief Justice, is the country's highest court of appeal, though it is also answerable to the National Assembly.", u"Beneath the Supreme People's Court stand the provincial municipal courts and numerous local courts.", u'Military courts possess special jurisdiction in matters of national security.', u'Vietnam maintains the death penalty for numerous offences; as of February 2014, there are around 700 inmates on death row in Vietnam.', u"=== Military ===\n\nThe Vietnam People's Armed Forces consists of the Vietnam People's Army, the Vietnam People's Public Security and the Vietnam Civil Defense Force.", u"The Vietnam People's Army (VPA) is the official name for the active military services of Vietnam, and is subdivided into the Vietnam People's Ground Forces, the Vietnam People's Navy, the Vietnam People's Air Force, the Vietnam Border Defense Force and the Vietnam Coast Guard.", u'The VPA has an active manpower of around 450,000, but its total strength, including paramilitary forces, may be as high as 5,000,000.', u"In 2011, Vietnam's military expenditure totalled approximately US$2.48 billion, equivalent to around 2.5% of its 2010 GDP.", u"=== International relations ===\n\nThroughout its history, Vietnam's key foreign relationship has been with its largest neighbour and one-time imperial master, China.", u"Vietnam's sovereign principles and insistence on cultural independence have been laid down in numerous documents over the centuries, such as the 11th-century patriotic poem Nam qu\u1ed1c s\u01a1n h\xe0 and the 1428 proclamation of independence B\xecnh Ng\xf4 \u0111\u1ea1i c\xe1o.", u'Though China and Vietnam are now formally at peace, significant territorial tensions remain between the two countries.', u'Currently, the formal mission statement of Vietnamese foreign policy is to: "Implement consistently the foreign policy line of independence, self-reliance, peace, cooperation and development; the foreign policy of openness and diversification and multi-lateralization of international relations.', u'Proactively and actively engage in international economic integration while expanding international cooperation in other fields."', u'Vietnam furthermore declares itself to be "a friend and reliable partner of all countries in the international community, actively taking part in international and regional cooperation processes."', u'By December 2007, Vietnam had established diplomatic relations with 172 countries, including the United States, which normalized relations in 1995.', u'Vietnam holds membership of 63 international organizations, including the United Nations, ASEAN, NAM, Francophonie and WTO.', u'It also maintains relations with over 650 non-government organizations.', u'In May 2016, President Obama further normalized relations with Vietnam after he announced the lifting of an arms embargo on sales of lethal arms to Vietnam.', u'=== Administrative subdivisions ===\n\nVietnam is divided into 58 provinces (Vietnamese: t\u1ec9nh, from the Chinese \u7701, sh\u011bng).', u'There are also five municipalities (th\xe0nh ph\u1ed1 tr\u1ef1c thu\u1ed9c trung \u01b0\u01a1ng), which are administratively on the same level as provinces.', u'The provinces are subdivided into provincial municipalities (th\xe0nh ph\u1ed1 tr\u1ef1c thu\u1ed9c t\u1ec9nh), townships (th\u1ecb x\xe3) and counties (huy\u1ec7n), which are in turn subdivided into towns (th\u1ecb tr\u1ea5n) or communes (x\xe3).', u'The centrally controlled municipalities are subdivided into districts (qu\u1eadn) and counties, which are further subdivided into wards (ph\u01b0\u1eddng).', u'== Geography ==\n\nVietnam is located on the eastern Indochina Peninsula between the latitudes 8\xb0 and 24\xb0N, and the longitudes 102\xb0 and 110\xb0E.', u'It covers a total area of approximately 331,210 km2 (127,881 sq mi), making it almost the size of Germany.', u"The combined length of the country's land boundaries is 4,639 km (2,883 mi), and its coastline is 3,444 km (2,140 mi) long.", u'At its narrowest point in the central Qu\u1ea3ng B\xecnh Province, the country is as little as 50 kilometres (31 mi) across, though it widens to around 600 kilometres (370 mi) in the north.', u"Vietnam's land is mostly hilly and densely forested, with level land covering no more than 20%.", u"Mountains account for 40% of the country's land area, and tropical forests cover around 42%.", u'The northern part of the country consists mostly of highlands and the Red River Delta.', u'Phan Xi P\u0103ng, located in L\xe0o Cai Province, is the highest mountain in Vietnam, standing 3,143 m (10,312 ft) high.', u'Southern Vietnam is divided into coastal lowlands, the mountains of the Annamite Range, and extensive forests.', u"Comprising five relatively flat plateaus of basalt soil, the highlands account for 16% of the country's arable land and 22% of its total forested land.", u'The soil in much of southern Vietnam is relatively poor in nutrients.', u'The Red River Delta, a flat, roughly triangular region covering 15,000 km2 (5,792 sq mi), is smaller but more intensely developed and more densely populated than the Mekong River Delta.', u'Once an inlet of the Gulf of Tonkin, it has been filled in over the millennia by riverine alluvial deposits.', u'The delta, covering about 40,000 km2 (15,444 sq mi), is a low-level plain no more than 3 meters (9.8 ft) above sea level at any point.', u'It is criss-crossed by a maze of rivers and canals, which carry so much sediment that the delta advances 60 to 80 meters (196.9 to 262.5 ft) into the sea every year.', u'=== Panoramic view ===\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nBecause of differences in latitude and the marked variety in topographical relief, the climate tends to vary considerably from place to place.', u'During the winter or dry season, extending roughly from November to April, the monsoon winds usually blow from the northeast along the Chinese coast and across the Gulf of Tonkin, picking up considerable moisture.', u'Consequently, the winter season in most parts of the country is dry only by comparison with the rainy or summer season.', u'The average annual temperature is generally higher in the plains than in the mountains, and higher in the south than in the north.', u'Temperatures vary less in the southern plains around Ho Chi Minh City and the Mekong Delta, ranging between 21 and 28 \xb0C (69.8 and 82.4 \xb0F) over the course of the year.', u'Seasonal variations in the mountains and plateaus and in the north are much more dramatic, with temperatures varying from 5 \xb0C (41.0 \xb0F) in December and January to 37 \xb0C (98.6 \xb0F) in July and August.', u'=== Ecology and biodiversity ===\n\nVietnam has two World Natural Heritage Sites \u2013 H\u1ea1 Long Bay and Phong Nha-K\u1ebb B\xe0ng National Park \u2013 and six biosphere reserves, including C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd Mangrove Forest, C\xe1t Ti\xean, C\xe1t B\xe0, Ki\xean Giang, the Red River Delta, and Western Ngh\u1ec7 An.', u'Vietnam lies in the Indomalaya ecozone.', u'According to the 2005 National Environmental Present Condition Report.', u'Vietnam is one of twenty-five countries considered to possess a uniquely high level of biodiversity.', u"It is ranked 16th worldwide in biological diversity, being home to approximately 16% of the world's species.", u"15,986 species of flora have been identified in the country, of which 10% are endemic, while Vietnam's fauna include 307 nematode species, 200 oligochaeta, 145 acarina, 113 springtails, 7,750 insects, 260 reptiles, 120 amphibians, 840 birds and 310 mammals, of which 100 birds and 78 mammals are endemic.", u'Vietnam is furthermore home to 1,438 species of freshwater microalgae, constituting 9.6% of all microalgae species, as well as 794 aquatic invertebrates and 2,458 species of sea fish.', u'In recent years, 13 genera, 222 species, and 30 taxa of flora have been newly described in Vietnam.', u"Six new mammal species, including the saola, giant muntjac and Tonkin snub-nosed monkey have also been discovered, along with one new bird species, the endangered Edwards's pheasant.", u'In the late 1980s, a small population of Javan rhinoceros was found in C\xe1t Ti\xean National Park.', u'However, the last individual of the species in Vietnam was reportedly shot in 2010.', u"In agricultural genetic diversity, Vietnam is one of the world's twelve original cultivar centers.", u'The Vietnam National Cultivar Gene Bank preserves 12,300 cultivars of 115 species.', u'The Vietnamese government spent US$49.07 million on the preservation of biodiversity in 2004 alone, and has established 126 conservation areas, including 28 national parks.', u"== Economy ==\n\nIn 2012, Vietnam's nominal GDP reached US$138 billion, with a nominal GDP per capita of $1,527.", u"According to a December 2005 forecast by Goldman Sachs, the Vietnamese economy will become the world's 21st-largest by 2025, with an estimated nominal GDP of $436 billion and a nominal GDP per capita of $4,357.", u"According to a 2008 forecast by PricewaterhouseCoopers, Vietnam may be the fastest-growing of the world's emerging economies by 2025, with a potential growth rate of almost 10% per annum in real dollar terms.", u"In 2012, HSBC predicted that Vietnam's total GDP would surpass those of Norway, Singapore and Portugal by 2050.", u'Vietnam has been for much of its history a predominantly agricultural civilization based on wet rice cultivation.', u'There is also an industry for bauxite mining in Vietnam, an important material for the production of aluminum.', u'The Vietnamese economy is shaped primarily by the Vietnamese Communist Party in Five Year Plans made through the plenary sessions of the Central Committee and national congresses.', u'The collectivization of farms, factories and economic capital is a part of this central planning, with millions of people working in government programs.', u"Vietnam's economy has been plagued with inefficiency and corruption in state programs, poor quality and underproduction, and restrictions on economic activity.", u'It also suffered from the post-war trade embargo instituted by the United States and most of Europe.', u"These problems were compounded by the erosion of the Soviet bloc, which included Vietnam's main trading partners, in the late 1980s.", u'In 1986, the Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party introduced socialist-oriented market economic reforms as part of the \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi reform program.', u'Private ownership was encouraged in industries, commerce and agriculture.', u"Thanks largely to these reforms, Vietnam achieved around 8% annual GDP growth between 1990 and 1997, and the economy continued to grow at an annual rate of around 7% from 2000 to 2005, making Vietnam one of the world's fastest growing economies.", u"Growth remained strong even in the face of the late-2000s global recession, holding at 6.8% in 2010, but Vietnam's year-on-year inflation rate hit 11.8% in December 2010, according to a GSO estimate.", u'The Vietnamese dong was devalued three times in 2010 alone.', u'Manufacturing, information technology and high-tech industries now form a large and fast-growing part of the national economy.', u'Though Vietnam is a relative newcomer to the oil industry, it is currently the third-largest oil producer in Southeast Asia, with a total 2011 output of 318,000 barrels per day (50,600 m3/d).', u'In 2010, Vietnam was ranked as the 8th largest crude petroleum producers in the Asia and Pacific region.', u'Like its Chinese neighbours, Vietnam continues to make use of centrally planned economic five-year plans.', u'Deep poverty, defined as the percentage of the population living on less than $1 per day, has declined significantly in Vietnam, and the relative poverty rate is now less than that of China, India, and the Philippines.', u'This decline in the poverty rate can be attributed to equitable economic policies aimed at improving living standards and preventing the rise of inequality; these policies have included egalitarian land distribution during the initial stages of the \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi program, investment in poorer remote areas, and subsidising of education and healthcare.', u'According to the IMF, the unemployment rate in Vietnam stood at 4.46% in 2012.', u'=== Trade ===\n\nSince the early 2000s, Vietnam has applied sequenced trade liberalisation, a two-track approach opening some sectors of the economy to international markets while protecting others.', u'In July 2006, Vietnam updated its intellectual property legislation to comply with TRIPS, and it became a member of the WTO on 11 January 2007.', u"Vietnam is now one of Asia's most open economies: two-way trade was valued at around 160% of GDP in 2006, more than twice the contemporary ratio for China and over four times the ratio for India.", u"Vietnam's chief trading partners include China, Japan, Australia, the ASEAN countries, the United States and Western Europe.", u"Vietnam's Customs office reported in July 2013 that the total value of international merchandise trade for the first half of 2013 was US$124 billion, which was 15.7% higher than the same period in 2012.", u'Mobile phones and their parts were both imported and exported in large numbers, while in the natural resources market, crude oil was a top-ranking export and high levels of iron and steel were imported during this period.', u"The U.S. was the country that purchased the highest amount of Vietnam's exports, while Chinese goods were the most popular Vietnamese import.", u'As a result of several land reform measures, Vietnam has become a major exporter of agricultural products.', u"It is now the world's largest producer of cashew nuts, with a one-third global share; the largest producer of black pepper, accounting for one-third of the world's market; and the second-largest rice exporter in the world, after Thailand.", u"Vietnam is the world's second largest exporter of coffee.", u'Vietnam has the highest proportion of land use for permanent crops \u2013 6.93% \u2013 of any nation in the Greater Mekong Subregion.', u'Other primary exports include tea, rubber, and fishery products.', u"However, agriculture's share of Vietnam's GDP has fallen in recent decades, declining from 42% in 1989 to 20% in 2006, as production in other sectors of the economy has risen.", u"In 2014 Vietnam negotiated a free trade agreement with the European Union, giving the country access to the EU's Generalized System of Preferences.", u'This provides preferential access to European markets for developing countries through reduced tariffs.', u'=== Science and technology ===\n\nVietnamese scholars developed many academic fields during the dynastic era, most notably social sciences and the humanities.', u'Vietnam has a millennium-deep legacy of analytical histories, such as the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t s\u1eed k\xfd to\xe0n th\u01b0 of Ng\xf4 S\u0129 Li\xean.', u'Vietnamese monks led by the abdicated Emperor Tr\u1ea7n Nh\xe2n T\xf4ng developed the Tr\xfac L\xe2m Zen branch of philosophy in the 13th century.', u'Arithmetics and geometry have been widely taught in Vietnam since the 15th century, using the textbook \u0110\u1ea1i th\xe0nh to\xe1n ph\xe1p by L\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ebf Vinh as a basis.', u'L\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ebf Vinh introduced Vietnam to the notion of zero, while M\u1ea1c Hi\u1ec3n T\xedch used the term s\u1ed1 \u1ea9n (en: "unknown/secret/hidden number") to refer to negative numbers.', u"Vietnamese scholars furthermore produced numerous encyclopedias, such as L\xea Qu\xfd \u0110\xf4n's V\xe2n \u0111\xe0i lo\u1ea1i ng\u1eef.", u'In recent times, Vietnamese scientists have made many significant contributions in various fields of study, most notably in mathematics.', u'Ho\xe0ng T\u1ee5y pioneered the applied mathematics field of global optimization in the 20th century, while Ng\xf4 B\u1ea3o Ch\xe2u won the 2010 Fields Medal for his proof of fundamental lemma in the theory of automorphic forms.', u'Vietnam is currently working to develop an indigenous space program, and plans to construct the US$600 million Vietnam Space Center by 2018.', u'Vietnam has also made significant advances in the development of robots, such as the TOPIO humanoid model.', u"In 2010, Vietnam's total state spending on science and technology equalled around 0.45% of its GDP.", u"=== Transport ===\n\nMuch of Vietnam's modern transport network was originally developed under French rule to facilitate the transportation of raw materials, and was reconstructed and extensively modernized following the Vietnam War.", u'==== Air ====\n\nVietnam operates 21 major civil airports, including three international gateways: Noi Bai in Hanoi, Da Nang International Airport in Da Nang, and Tan Son Nhat in Ho Chi Minh City.', u"Tan Son Nhat is the nation's largest airport, handling 75% of international passenger traffic.", u'According to a state-approved plan, Vietnam will have 10 international airports by 2015 \u2013 besides the aforementioned three, these include Vinh International Airport, Phu Bai International Airport, Cam Ranh International Airport, Phu Quoc International Airport, Cat Bi International Airport, C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 International Airport and Long Thanh International Airport.', u'The planned Long Thanh International Airport will have an annual service capacity of 100 million passengers once it becomes fully operational in 2020.', u'Vietnam Airlines, the state-owned national airline, maintains a fleet of 69 passenger aircraft, and aims to operate 150 by 2020.', u'Several private airlines are also in operation in Vietnam, including Air Mekong, Jetstar Pacific Airlines, VASCO and VietJet Air.', u"==== Road ====\n\nVietnam's road system includes national roads administered at the central level, provincial roads managed at the provincial level, district roads managed at the district level, urban roads managed by cities and towns, and commune roads managed at the commune level.", u"Bicycles, motor scooters and motorcycles remain the most popular forms of road transport in Vietnam's urban areas, although the number of privately owned automobiles is also on the rise, especially in the larger cities.", u'Public buses operated by private companies are the main mode of long-distance travel for much of the population.', u'Road safety is a serious issue in Vietnam \u2013 on average, 30 people are killed in traffic accidents every day.', u"Traffic congestion is a growing problem in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, as the cities' roads struggle to cope with the boom in automobile use.", u"==== Rail ====\n\nVietnam's primary cross-country rail service is the Reunification Express, which runs from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi, covering a distance of nearly 2,000 kilometres.", u'From Hanoi, railway lines branch out to the northeast, north and west; the eastbound line runs from Hanoi to H\u1ea1 Long Bay, the northbound line from Hanoi to Th\xe1i Nguy\xean, and the northeast line from Hanoi to L\xe0o Cai.', u'In 2009, Vietnam and Japan signed a deal to build a high-speed railway using Japanese technology; numerous Vietnamese engineers were later sent to Japan to receive training in the operation and maintenance of high-speed trains.', u'The railway will be a 1,630-km-long express route, serving a total of 26 stations, including Hanoi and the Thu Thiem terminus in Ho Chi Minh City.', u"Using Japan's Shinkansen technology, the line will support trains travelling at a maximum speed of 360 kilometres (220 mi) per hour.", u'The high-speed lines linking Hanoi to Vinh, Nha Trang and Ho Chi Minh City will be laid by 2015.', u'From 2015 to 2020, construction will begin on the routes between Vinh and Nha Trang and between Hanoi and the northern provinces of L\xe0o Cai and L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n.', u'==== Water ====\nAs a coastal country, Vietnam has many major sea ports, including Cam Ranh, Da Nang, Hai Phong, Ho Chi Minh City, Hong Gai, Qui Nh\u01a1n, V\u0169ng T\xe0u and Nha Trang.', u"Further inland, the country's extensive network of rivers play a key role in rural transportation, with over 17,700 kilometres (11,000 mi) of navigable waterways carrying ferries, barges and water taxis.", u"In addition, the Mekong Delta and Red River Delta are vital to Vietnam's social and economic welfare \u2013 most of the country's population lives along or near these river deltas, and the major cities of Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi are situated near the Mekong and Red River deltas, respectively.", u'Further out in the South China Sea, Vietnam currently controls the majority of the disputed Spratly Islands, which are the source of longstanding disagreements with China and other nearby nations.', u'=== Water supply and sanitation ===\n\nWater supply and sanitation in Vietnam is characterized by challenges and achievements.', u'Among the achievements is a substantial increase in access to water supply and sanitation between 1990 and 2010, nearly universal metering, and increased investment in wastewater treatment since 2007.', u'Among the challenges are continued widespread water pollution, poor service quality, low access to improved sanitation in rural areas, poor sustainability of rural water systems, insufficient cost recovery for urban sanitation, and the declining availability of foreign grant and soft loan funding as the Vietnamese economy grows and donors shift to loan financing.', u'The government also promotes increased cost recovery through tariff revenues and has created autonomous water utilities at the provincial level, but the policy has had mixed success as tariff levels remain low and some utilities have engaged in activities outside their mandate.', u'== Demographics ==\n\nAs of 2014, the population of Vietnam as standing at approximately 90.7 million people.', u'The population had grown significantly from the 1979 census, which showed the total population of reunified Vietnam to be 52.7 million.', u"In 2012, the country's population was estimated at approximately 90.3 million.", u"Currently, the total fertility rate of Vietnam is 1.8 (births per woman), which is largely due to the government's family planning policy, the two-child policy.", u'=== Ethnicity ===\n\nAccording to the 2009 census, the dominant Viet or Kinh ethnic group constituted nearly 73.6 million people, or 85.8% of the population.', u'The Kinh population is concentrated mainly in the alluvial deltas and coastal plains of the country.', u'A largely homogeneous social and ethnic group, the Kinh possess significant political and economic influence over the country.', u'However, Vietnam is also home to 54 ethnic minority groups, including the Hmong, Dao, Tay, Thai, and N\xf9ng.', u"Many ethnic minorities \u2013 such as the Muong, who are closely related to the Kinh \u2013 dwell in the highlands, which cover two-thirds of Vietnam's territory.", u"Before the Vietnam War, the population of the Central Highlands was almost exclusively Degar (including over 40 tribal groups); however, Ng\xf4 \u0110\xecnh Di\u1ec7m's South Vietnamese government enacted a program of resettling Kinh in indigenous areas.", u'The Hoa (ethnic Chinese) and Khmer Krom people are mainly lowlanders.', u'As Sino-Vietnamese relations soured in 1978 and 1979, some 450,000 Hoa left Vietnam.', u'=== Languages ===\n\nThe official national language of Vietnam is Vietnamese (Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t), a tonal Mon\u2013Khmer language which is spoken by the majority of the population.', u'In its early history, Vietnamese writing used Chinese characters.', u'In the 13th century, the Vietnamese developed their own set of characters, referred to as Ch\u1eef n\xf4m.', u'The folk epic Truy\u1ec7n Ki\u1ec1u ("The Tale of Kieu", originally known as \u0110o\u1ea1n tr\u01b0\u1eddng t\xe2n thanh ) by Nguy\u1ec5n Du was written in Ch\u1eef n\xf4m.', u'Qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef, the romanized Vietnamese alphabet used for spoken Vietnamese, was developed in the 17th century by the Jesuit Alexandre de Rhodes and several other Catholic missionaries.', u'Qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef became widely popular and brought literacy to the Vietnamese masses during the French colonial period.', u"Vietnam's minority groups speak a variety of languages, including T\xe0y, M\u01b0\u1eddng, Cham, Khmer, Chinese, N\xf9ng, and H'M\xf4ng.", u'The Montagnard peoples of the Central Highlands also speak a number of distinct languages.', u'A number of sign languages have developed in the cities.', u'The French language, a legacy of colonial rule, is spoken by many educated Vietnamese as a second language, especially among the older generation and those educated in the former South Vietnam, where it was a principal language in administration, education and commerce; Vietnam remains a full member of the Francophonie, and education has revived some interest in the language.', u'Russian \u2013 and to a much lesser extent German, Czech and Polish \u2013 are known among some Vietnamese whose families had ties with the Soviet bloc during the Cold War.', u"In recent years, as Vietnam's contacts with Western nations have increased, English has become more popular as a second language.", u'The study of English is now obligatory in most schools, either alongside or in many cases, replacing French.', u"Japanese and Korean have also grown in popularity as Vietnam's links with other East Asian nations have strengthened.", u"=== Religion ===\n\nAccording to an analysis by the Pew Research Center, in 2010 about 45.3% of the Vietnamese adhere to indigenous religions, 16.4% to Buddhism, 8.2% to Christianity, 0.4% to other faiths, and 29.6% of the population isn't religious.", u"According to the General Statistics Office of Vietnam's report for 1 April 2009, 6.8 million (or 7.9% of the total population) are practicing Buddhists, 5.7 million (6.6%) are Catholics, 1.4 million (1.7%) are adherents of H\xf2a H\u1ea3o, 0.8 million (0.9%) practise Caodaism, and 0.7 million (0.9%) are Protestants.", u'In total, 15,651,467 Vietnamese (18.2%) are formally registered in a religion.', u'According to the 2009 census, while over 10 million people have taken refuge in the Three Jewels of Buddhism, the vast majority of Vietnamese people practice ancestor worship in some form.', u'According to a 2007 report, 81% of the Vietnamese people do not believe in God.', u'About 8% of the population are Christians, totalling around six million Roman Catholics and fewer than one million Protestants.', u'Christianity was first introduced to Vietnam by Portuguese and Dutch traders in the 16th and 17th centuries, and was further propagated by French missionaries in the 19th and 20th centuries, and to a lesser extent, by American Protestant missionaries during the Vietnam War, largely among the Montagnards of South Vietnam.', u'The largest Protestant churches are the Evangelical Church of Vietnam and the Montagnard Evangelical Church.', u"Two-thirds of Vietnam's Protestants are reportedly members of ethnic minorities.", u"Although a small religious minority, Protestantism is claimed to be the country's fastest-growing religion, expanding at a rate of 600% in the previous decade.", u'The Vietnamese government is widely seen as suspicious of Roman Catholicism.', u'This mistrust originated during the 19th century, when some Catholics collaborated with the French colonists in conquering and ruling the country and in helping French attempts to install Catholic emperors, such as in the L\xea V\u0103n Kh\xf4i revolt of 1833.', u"Furthermore, the Catholic Church's strongly anti-communist stance has made it an enemy of the Vietnamese state.", u'The Vatican Church is officially banned, and only government-controlled Catholic organisations are permitted.', u'However, the Vatican has attempted to negotiate the opening of diplomatic relations with Vietnam in recent years.', u'Several other minority faiths exist in Vietnam.', u'A significant number of people are adherents of Caodaism, an indigenous folk religion which has structured itself on the model of the Catholic Church.', u'Sunni and Cham Bani Islam is primarily practiced by the ethnic Cham minority, though there are also a few ethnic Vietnamese adherents in the southwest.', u"In total, there are approximately 70,000 Muslims in Vietnam, while around 50,000 Hindus and a small number of Baha'is are also in evidence.", u'The Vietnamese government rejects allegations that it does not allow religious freedom.', u"The state's official position on religion is that all citizens are free to their belief, and that all religions are equal before the law.", u'Nevertheless, only government-approved religious organisations are allowed; for example, the South Vietnam-founded Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam is banned in favour of a communist-approved body.', u'=== Education ===\n\nVietnam has an extensive state-controlled network of schools, colleges and universities, and a growing number of privately run and partially privatised institutions.', u'General education in Vietnam is divided into five categories: kindergarten, elementary schools, middle schools, high schools, and universities.', u'A large number of public schools have been constructed across the country to raise the national literacy rate, which stood at 90.3% in 2008.', u"A large number of Vietnam's most acclaimed universities are based in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.", u"Facing serious crises, Vietnam's education system is under a holistic program of reform launched by the government.", u'Education is not free; therefore, some poor families may have trouble paying tuition for their children without some form of public or private assistance.', u'Regardless, school enrollment is among the highest in the world, and the number of colleges and universities increased dramatically in the 2000s, from 178 in 2000 to 299 in 2005.', u"=== Health ===\n\nIn 2009, Vietnam's national life expectancy stood at 76 years for women and 72 for men, and the infant mortality rate was 12 per 1,000 live births.", u'By 2009, 85% of the population had access to improved water sources.', u'However, malnutrition is still common in the rural provinces.', u"In 2001, government spending on health care corresponded to just 0.9% of Vietnam's gross domestic product (GDP), with state subsidies covering only about 20% of health care expenses.", u'In 1954, North Vietnam established a public health system that reached down to the hamlet level.', u'After the national reunification in 1975, a nationwide health service was established.', u'In the late 1980s, the quality of healthcare declined to some degree as a result of budgetary constraints, a shift of responsibility to the provinces, and the introduction of charges.', u'Inadequate funding has also contributed to a shortage of nurses, midwives, and hospital beds; in 2000, Vietnam had only 250,000 hospital beds, or 14.8 beds per 10,000 people, according to the World Bank.', u'Since the early 2000s, Vietnam has made significant progress in combating malaria, with the malaria mortality rate falling to about 5% of its 1990s equivalent by 2005, after the country introduced improved antimalarial drugs and treatment.', u'However, tuberculosis cases are on the rise, with 57 deaths per day reported in May 2004.', u'With an intensified vaccination program, better hygiene, and foreign assistance, Vietnam hopes to reduce sharply the number of TB cases and annual new TB infections.', u'As of September 2005, Vietnam had diagnosed 101,291 HIV cases, of which 16,528 progressed to AIDS, and 9,554 died.', u'However, the actual number of HIV-positive individuals is estimated to be much higher.', u'On average, 40\u201350 new infections are reported every day in Vietnam.', u'As of 2007, 0.5% of the population is estimated to be infected with HIV, and this figure has remained stable since 2005.', u'In June 2004, the United States announced that Vietnam would be one of 15 nations to receive funding as part of a US$15 billion global AIDS relief plan.', u"== Culture ==\n\nVietnam's culture has developed over the centuries from indigenous ancient \u0110\xf4ng S\u01a1n culture with wet rice agriculture as its economic base.", u'Some elements of the national culture have Chinese origins, drawing on elements of Confucianism and Taoism in its traditional political system and philosophy.', u'Vietnamese society is structured around l\xe0ng (ancestral villages); all Vietnamese mark a common ancestral anniversary on the tenth day of the third lunar month.', u'The influences of immigrant peoples \u2013 such as the Cantonese, Hakka, Hokkien and Hainan cultures \u2013 can also be seen, while the national religion of Buddhism is strongly entwined with popular culture.', u'In recent centuries, the influences of Western cultures, most notably France and the United States, have become evident in Vietnam.', u'The traditional focuses of Vietnamese culture are humanity (nh\xe2n ngh\u0129a) and harmony (h\xf2a); family and community values are highly regarded.', u"Vietnam reveres a number of key cultural symbols, such as the Vietnamese dragon, which is derived from crocodile and snake imagery; Vietnam's National Father, L\u1ea1c Long Qu\xe2n, is depicted as a holy dragon.", u"The l\u1ea1c \u2013 a holy bird representing Vietnam's National Mother, \xc2u C\u01a1 \u2013 is another prominent symbol, while turtle and horse images are also revered.", u'In the modern era, the cultural life of Vietnam has been deeply influenced by government-controlled media and cultural programs.', u'For many decades, foreign cultural influences \u2013 especially those of Western origin \u2013 were shunned.', u'However, since the 1990s, Vietnam has seen a greater exposure to Southeast Asian, European and American culture and media.', u"=== Media ===\n\nVietnam's media sector is regulated by the government in accordance with the 2004 Law on Publication.", u"It is generally perceived that Vietnam's media sector is controlled by the government to follow the official Communist Party line, though some newspapers are relatively outspoken.", u'The Voice of Vietnam is the official state-run national radio broadcasting service, broadcasting internationally via shortwave using rented transmitters in other countries, and providing broadcasts from its website.', u'Vietnam Television is the national television broadcasting company.', u'Since 1997, Vietnam has extensively regulated public Internet access, using both legal and technical means.', u'The resulting lockdown is widely referred to as the "Bamboo Firewall".', u'The collaborative project OpenNet Initiative classifies Vietnam\'s level of online political censorship to be "pervasive", while Reporters Without Borders considers Vietnam to be one of 15 global "internet enemies".', u'Though the government of Vietnam claims to safeguard the country against obscene or sexually explicit content through its blocking efforts, many politically and religiously sensitive websites are also banned.', u"=== Music ===\n\nTraditional Vietnamese music varies between the country's northern and southern regions.", u"Northern classical music is Vietnam's oldest musical form, and is traditionally more formal.", u'The origins of Vietnamese classical music can be traced to the Mongol invasions of the 13th century, when the Vietnamese captured a Chinese opera troupe.', u'Throughout its history, Vietnamese has been most heavily impacted by the Chinese musical tradition, as an integral part, along with Korea, Mongolia and Japan.', u'Nh\xe3 nh\u1ea1c is the most popular form of imperial court music.', u'Ch\xe8o is a form of generally satirical musical theatre.', u'X\u1ea9m or H\xe1t x\u1ea9m (X\u1ea9m singing) is a type of Vietnamese folk music.', u'Quan h\u1ecd (alternate singing) is popular in H\xe0 B\u1eafc (divided into B\u1eafc Ninh and B\u1eafc Giang Provinces) and across Vietnam.', u'H\xe1t ch\u1ea7u v\u0103n or h\xe1t v\u0103n is a spiritual form of music used to invoke spirits during ceremonies.', u'Nh\u1ea1c d\xe2n t\u1ed9c c\u1ea3i bi\xean is a modern form of Vietnamese folk music which arose in the 1950s.', u'Ca tr\xf9 (also h\xe1t \u1ea3 \u0111\xe0o) is a popular folk music.', u'"H\xf2" can not be thought of as the southern style of Quan h\u1ecd.', u'There are a range of traditional instruments, including the \u0110\xe0n b\u1ea7u (a monochord zither), the \u0110\xe0n g\xe1o (a two-stringed fiddle with coconut body), and the \u0110\xe0n nguy\u1ec7t (a two-stringed fretted moon lute).', u'=== Literature ===\n\nVietnamese literature has a centuries-deep history.', u'The country has a rich tradition of folk literature, based on the typical 6\u2013to-8-verse poetic form named ca dao, which usually focuses on village ancestors and heroes.', u'Written literature has been found dating back to the 10th-century Ng\xf4 dynasty, with notable ancient authors including Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\xe3i, Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o, Nguy\u1ec5n Du and Nguy\u1ec5n \u0110\xecnh Chi\u1ec3u.', u'Some literary genres play an important role in theatrical performance, such as h\xe1t n\xf3i in ca tr\xf9.', u'Some poetic unions have also been formed in Vietnam, such as the Tao \u0110\xe0n.', u'Vietnamese literature has in recent times been influenced by Western styles, with the first literary transformation movement \u2013 Th\u01a1 M\u1edbi \u2013 emerging in 1932.', u'=== Festivals ===\n\nVietnam has a plethora of festivals based on the lunar calendar, the most important being the T\u1ebft New Year celebration.', u'Traditional Vietnamese weddings remain widely popular, and are often celebrated by expatriate Vietnamese in Western countries.', u'=== Tourism ===\n\nVietnam has become a major tourist destination since the 1990s, assisted by significant state and private investment, particularly in coastal regions.', u'About 3.77 million international tourists visited Vietnam in 2009 alone.', u'Popular tourist destinations include the former imperial capital of Hu\xe9, the World Heritage Sites of Phong Nha-K\u1ebb B\xe0ng National Park, H\u1ed9i An and M\u1ef9 S\u01a1n, coastal regions such as Nha Trang, the caves of H\u1ea1 Long Bay and the Marble Mountains.', u'Numerous tourist projects are under construction, such as the B\xecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng tourist complex, which possesses the largest artificial sea in Southeast Asia.', u"On 14 February 2011, Joe Jackson, the father of American pop star Michael Jackson, attended a ground breaking ceremony for what will be Southeast Asia's largest entertainment complex, a five-star hotel and amusement park called Happyland.", u'The US$2 billion project, which has been designed to accommodate 14 million tourists annually, is located in southern Long An Province, near Ho Chi Minh City.', u'It is expected that the complex will be completed in 2014.', u'=== Clothing ===\nThe \xe1o d\xe0i, a formal dress, is worn for special occasions such as weddings and religious festivals.', u'White \xe1o d\xe0i is the required uniform for girls in many high schools across Vietnam.', u'\xc1o d\xe0i was once worn by both genders, but today it is mostly the preserve of women, although men do wear it to some occasions, such as traditional weddings.', u'Other examples of traditional Vietnamese clothing include the \xe1o t\u1ee9 th\xe2n, a four-piece woman\'s dress; the \xe1o ng\u0169, a form of the th\xe2n in 5-piece form, mostly worn in the north of the country; the y\u1ebfm, a woman\'s undergarment; the \xe1o b\xe0 ba, rural working "pyjamas" for men and women; the \xe1o g\u1ea5m, a formal brocade tunic for government receptions;

and recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1979.', u'As of 2014, Vietnam has never participated in the Winter Olympics.', u'In 2016, Vietnam participated in the Rio Olympics, where they won their first gold medal.', u'=== Cuisine ===\n\nVietnamese cuisine traditionally features a combination of five fundamental taste "elements" (Vietnamese: ng\u0169 v\u1ecb): spicy (metal), sour (wood), bitter (fire), salty (water) and sweet (earth).', u'Common ingredients include fish sauce, shrimp paste, soy sauce, rice, fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables.', u"Vietnamese recipes use lemongrass, ginger, mint, Vietnamese mint, long coriander, Saigon cinnamon, bird's eye chili, lime and basil leaves.", u'Traditional Vietnamese cooking is known for its fresh ingredients, minimal use of oil, and reliance on herbs and vegetables, and is considered one of the healthiest cuisines worldwide.', u'In northern Vietnam, local foods are often less spicy than southern dishes, as the colder northern climate limits the production and availability of spices.', u'Black pepper is used in place of chilis to produce spicy flavors.', u'The use of such meats as pork, beef, and chicken was relatively limited in the past, and as a result freshwater fish, crustaceans \u2013 particularly crabs \u2013 and mollusks became widely used.', u'Fish sauce, soy sauce, prawn sauce, and limes are among the main flavoring ingredients.', u'Many signature Vietnamese dishes, such as b\xfan ri\xeau and b\xe1nh cu\u1ed1n, originated in the north and were carried to central and southern Vietnam by

{'sentences': [u'An electric light is a device that produces visible light by the flow of electric current.', u'It is the most common form of artificial lighting and is essential to modern society, providing interior lighting for buildings and exterior light for evening and nighttime activities.', u'In technical usage, a replaceable component that produces light from electricity is called a lamp.', u'Compact lamps are commonly called light bulbs; for example, the incandescent light bulb.', u'Lamps usually have a base made of ceramic, metal, glass or plastic, which secures the lamp in the socket of a light fixture.', u'The electrical connection to the socket may be made with a screw-thread base, two metal pins, two metal caps or a bayonet cap.', u'The three main categories of electric lights are incandescent lamps, which produce light by a filament heated white-hot by electric current, gas-discharge lamps, which produce light by means of an electric arc through a gas, and LED lamps, which produce light by a flow of electrons across a band gap in a semiconductor.', u'Before electric lighting became common in the early 20th century, people used candles, gas lights, oil lamps, and fires.', u'Humphry Davy developed the first incandescent light in 1802, followed by the first practical electric arc light in 1806.', u"By the 1870s, Davy's arc lamp had been successfully commercialized, and was used to light many public spaces.", u'The development of a steadily glowing filament suitable for interior lighting took longer, but by the early twentieth century inventors had successfully developed options, replacing the arc light with incandescents.', u'The energy efficiency of electric lighting has increased radically since the first demonstration of arc lamps and the incandescent light bulb of the 19th century.', u'Modern electric light sources come in a profusion of types and sizes adapted to myriad applications.', u'Most modern electric lighting is powered by centrally generated electric power, but lighting may also be powered by mobile or standby electric generators or battery systems.', u'Battery-powered light is often reserved for when and where stationary lights fail, often in the form of flashlights, electric lanterns, and in vehicles.', u'== Types ==\n\nTypes of electric lighting include:\nIncandescent light bulb, a heated filament inside a glass envelope\nHalogen lamps are incandescent lamps that use a fused quartz envelope filled with halogen gas\n\nLED lamp, a solid-state lamp that uses light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as the source of light\nArc lamp\nXenon arc lamp\nMercury-xenon arc lamp\nUltra-high-performance lamp, an ultra-high-pressure mercury-vapor arc lamp for use in projectors\nMetal-halide lamp\n\nGas-discharge lamp, a light source that generates light by sending an electrical discharge through an ionized gas\nFluorescent lamp\nCompact fluorescent lamp, a fluorescent lamp designed to replace an incandescent lamp\n\nNeon lamp\nMercury-vapor lamp\nSodium-vapor lamp\nSulfur lamp\nElectrodeless lamp, a gas discharge lamp in which the power is transferred from outside the bulb to inside via electromagnetic fields\n\nDifferent types of lights have vastly differing efficiencies and color of light.', u'*Color temperature is defined as the temperature of a black body emitting a similar spectrum; these spectra are quite different from those of black bodies.', u'The most efficient source of electric light is the low-pressure sodium lamp.', u'It produces, for all practical purposes, a monochromatic orange/yellow light, which gives a similarly monochromatic perceprtion of any illuminated scene.', u'For this reason, it is generally reserved for outdoor public lighting usages.', u'Low-pressure sodium lights are favoured for public lighting by astronomers, since the light pollution that they generate can be easily filtered, contrary to broadband or continuous spectra.', u'=== Incandescent light bulb ===\n\nThe modern incandescent light bulb, with a coiled filament of tungsten, was commercialized in the 1920s developed from the carbon filament lamp introduced in about 1880.', u'As well as bulbs for normal illumination, there is a very wide range, including low voltage, low-power types often used as components in equipment, but now largely displaced by LEDs\nThere is currently interest in banning some types of filament lamp in some countries, such as Australia planning to ban standard incandescent light bulbs by 2010, because they are inefficient at converting electricity to light.', u'Sri Lanka has already banned importing filament bulbs because of high use of electricity and less light.', u'Less than 3% of the input energy is converted into usable light.', u'Nearly all of the input energy ends up as heat that, in warm climates, must then be removed from the building by ventilation or air conditioning, often resulting in more energy consumption.', u'In colder climates where heating and lighting is required during the cold and dark winter months, the heat byproduct has at least some value.', u'==== Halogen lamp ====\n\nHalogen lamps are usually much smaller than standard incandescents, because for successful operation a bulb temperature over 200 \xb0C is generally necessary.', u'For this reason, most have a bulb of fused silica (quartz), but sometimes aluminosilicate glass.', u'This is often sealed inside an additional layer of glass.', u'The outer glass is a safety precaution, reducing UV emission and because halogen bulbs can occasionally explode during operation.', u'One reason is if the quartz bulb has oily residue from fingerprints.', u'The risk of burns or fire is also greater with bare bulbs, leading to their prohibition in some places unless enclosed by the luminaire.', u'Those designed for 12 or 24 volt operation have compact filaments, useful for good optical control, also they have higher efficiencies (lumens per watt) and better lives than non-halogen types.', u'The light output remains almost constant throughout life.', u'=== Fluorescent lamp ===\n\nFluorescent lamps consist of a glass tube that contains mercury vapour or argon under low pressure.', u'Electricity flowing through the tube causes the gases to give off ultraviolet energy.', u'The inside of the tubes are coated with phosphors that give off visible light when struck by ultraviolet energy.', u'have much higher efficiency than Incandescent lamps.', u'For the same amount of light generated, they typically use around one-quarter to one-third the power of an incandescent.', u'The typical luminous efficacy of fluorescent lighting systems is 50\u2013100 lumens per watt, several times the efficacy of incandescent bulbs with comparable light output.', u'Fluorescent lamp fixtures are more costly than incandescent lamps because they require a ballast to regulate the current through the lamp, but the lower energy cost typically offsets the higher initial cost.', u'Compact fluorescent lamps are now available in the same popular sizes as incandescents and are used as an energy-saving alternative in homes.', u'Because they contain mercury, many fluorescent lamps are classified as hazardous waste.', u'The United States Environmental Protection Agency recommends that fluorescent lamps be segregated from general waste for recycling or safe disposal, and some jurisdictions require recycling of them.', u'=== LED lamp ===\n\nSolid state LEDs have been popular as indicator lights in consumer electronics and professional audio gear since the 1970s.', u'In the 2000s efficacy and output have risen to the point where LEDs are now being used in lighting applications such as car headlights and brakelights, in flashlights and bike lights, as well as in decorative applications such as holiday lighting.', u'Indicator LEDs are known for their extremely long life, up to 100,000 hours, but lighting LEDs are operated much less conservatively, and consequently have shorter lives.', u'LED technology is useful for lighting designers because of its low power consumption, low heat generation, instantaneous on/off control, and in the case of single color LEDs, continuity of color throughout the life of the diode and relatively low cost of manufacture.', u'LED lifetime depends strongly on the temperature of the diode.', u"Operating an LED lamp in conditions that increase the internal temperature can greatly shorten the lamp's life.", u'=== Carbon arc lamp ===\n\nCarbon arc lamps consist of two carbon rod electrodes in open air, supplied by a current-limiting ballast.', u'The electric arc is struck by touching the rods then separating them.', u'The ensuing arc heats the carbon tips to white heat.', u'These lamps have higher efficiency than filament lamps, but the carbon rods are short lived and require constant adjustment in use.', u'The lamps produce significant ultra-violet output, they require ventilation when used indoors, and due to their intensity they need protecting from direct sight.', u'Invented by Humphry Davy around 1805, the carbon arc was the first practical electric light.', u'They were used commercially beginning in the 1870s for large building and street lighting until they were superseded in the early 20th century by the incandescent light.', u'Carbon arc lamps operate at high powers and produce high intensity white light.', u'They also are a point source of light.', u'They remained in use in limited applications that required these properties, such as movie projectors, stage lighting, and searchlights, until after World War 2.', u'=== Discharge lamp ===\nA discharge lamp has a glass or silica envelope containing two metal electrodes separated by a gas.', u'Gases used include, neon, argon, xenon, sodium, metal halide, and mercury.', u"The core operating principle is much the same as the carbon arc lamp, but the term 'arc lamp' is normally used to refer to carbon arc lamps, with more modern types of gas discharge lamp normally called discharge lamps.", u'With some discharge lamps, very high voltage is used to strike the arc.', u'This requires an electrical circuit called an igniter, which is part of the ballast circuitry.', u'After the arc is struck, the internal resistance of the lamp drops to a low level, and the ballast limits the current to the operating current.', u'Without a ballast, excess current would flow, causing rapid destruction of the lamp.', u'Some lamp types contain a little neon, which permits striking at normal running voltage, with no external ignition circuitry.', u'Low pressure sodium lamps operate this way.', u'The simplest ballasts are just an inductor, and are chosen where cost is the deciding factor, such as street lighting.', u'More advanced electronic ballasts may be designed to maintain constant light output over the life of the lamp, may drive the lamp with a square wave to maintain completely flicker-free output, and shut down in the event of certain faults.', u'== Lamp life expectancy ==\nLife expectancy for many types of lamp is defined as the number of hours of operation at which 50% of them fail, that is the median life of the lamps.', u'Production tolerances as low as 1% can create a variance of 25% in lamp life, so in general some lamps will fail well before the rated life expectancy, and some will last much longer.', u'For LEDs, lamp life is defined as the operation time at which 50% of lamps have experienced a 70% decrease in light output.', u'Some types of lamp are also sensitive to switching cycles.', u'Rooms with frequent switching such as bathrooms can expect much shorter lamp life than what is printed on the box.', u'Compact fluorescent lamps are particularly sensitive to switching cycles.', u'== Public lighting ==\nThe total amount of artificial light (especially from street light) is sufficient for cities to be easily visible at night from the air, and from space.', u'This light is the source of light pollution that burdens astronomers and others.', u"Human-made lights highlight particularly developed or populated areas of the Earth's surface, including the seaboards of Europe, the eastern United States, India, Japan and South Korea.", u'== Uses other than illumination ==\n\nElectric lamps can be used as heat sources, for example in incubators, as heat lamps in fast food restaurants and toys such as the Easy-Bake Oven.', u'Tungsten filament lamps have long been used as fast-acting thermistors in electronic circuits.', u'Popular uses have included:\nStabilisation of sine wave oscillators\nProtection of tweeters in speaker enclosures (excess current that is too high for the tweeter illuminates the light rather than blowing the tweeter).', u'Automatic volume control in telephones\n\n\n== Lamp circuit symbols ==\nIn circuit diagrams lamps usually are shown as symbols.', u'There are two main types of symbols, these are:\n\n\n== See also ==\nLightbulb socket\nLight source\nLight tube\nList of light sources\n\n\n== References =='], 'year': '1879-02-10', 'title': '1st electric arc light used [in California

1894, and in June 1895 Alois retired to Hafeld, near Lambach, where he farmed and kept bees.', u'Hitler attended Volksschule (a state-owned school) in nearby Fischlham.', u"The move to Hafeld coincided with the onset of intense father-son conflicts caused by Hitler's refusal to conform to the strict discipline of his school.", u"Alois Hitler's farming efforts at Hafeld ended in failure, and in 1897 the family moved to Lambach.", u'The eight-year-old Hitler took singing lessons, sang in the church choir, and even considered becoming a priest.', u'In 1898 the family returned permanently to Leonding.', u'The death of his younger brother Edmund, who died from measles in 1900, deeply affected Hitler.', u'He changed from a confident, outgoing, conscientious student to a morose, detached boy who constantly fought with his father and teachers.', u'Alois had made a successful career in the customs bureau and wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.', u'Hitler later dramatised an episode from this period when his father took him to visit a customs office, depicting it as an event that gave rise to an unforgiving antagonism between father and son, who were both strong-willed.', u"Ignoring his son's desire to attend a classical high school and become an artist, Alois sent Hitler to the Realschule in Linz in September 1900.", u'Hitler rebelled against this decision, and in Mein Kampf stated that he intentionally did poorly in school, hoping that once his father saw "what little progress I was making at the technical school he would let me devote myself to my dream".', u'Like many Austrian Germans, Hitler began to develop German nationalist ideas from a young age.', u'He expressed loyalty only to Germany, despising the declining Habsburg Monarchy and its rule over an ethnically variegated empire.', u'Hitler and his friends used the greeting "Heil", and sang the "Deutschlandlied" instead of the Austrian Imperial anthem.', u"After Alois's sudden death on 3 January 1903, Hitler's performance at school deteriorated and his mother allowed him to leave.", u'He enrolled at the Realschule in Steyr in September 1904, where his behaviour and performance improved.', u'In 1905, after passing a repeat of the final exam, Hitler left the school without any ambitions for further education or clear plans for a career.', u"=== Early adulthood in Vienna and Munich ===\n\nFrom 1905, Hitler lived a bohemian life in Vienna, financed by orphan's benefits and support from his mother.", u"He worked as a casual labourer and eventually as a painter, selling watercolours of Vienna's sights.", u'The Academy of Fine Arts Vienna rejected him in 1907 and again in 1908, citing "unfitness for painting".', u'The director recommended that Hitler study architecture, which was also an interest, but he lacked academic credentials as he had not finished secondary school.', u'On 21 December 1907, his mother died of breast cancer at the age of 47.', u"Hitler ran out of money and was forced to live in homeless shelters and men's hostels.", u'At the time Hitler lived there, Vienna was a hotbed of religious prejudice and racism.', u'Fears of being overrun by immigrants from the East were widespread, and the populist mayor Karl Lueger exploited the rhetoric of virulent anti-Semitism for political effect.', u'German nationalism had a widespread following in the Mariahilf district, where Hitler lived.', u'German nationalist Georg Ritter von Sch\xf6nerer, who advocated Pan-Germanism, anti-Semitism, anti-Slavism, and anti-Catholicism, was one influence on Hitler.', u'Hitler read local newspapers such as the Deutsches Volksblatt that fanned prejudice and played on Christian fears of being swamped by an influx of eastern Jews.', u'Hitler also read newspapers that published the main thoughts of philosophers and theoreticians such as Darwin, Nietzsche, Le Bon and Schopenhauer.', u'Hostile to what he saw as "Catholic Germanophobia", he developed an admiration for Martin Luther.', u"The origin and first expression of Hitler's anti-Semitism remain a matter of debate.", u'Hitler states in Mein Kampf that he first became an anti-Semite in Vienna.', u'His close friend, August Kubizek, claimed that Hitler was a "confirmed anti-Semite" before he left Linz.', u'Several sources provide strong evidence that Hitler had Jewish friends in his hostel and in other places in Vienna.', u'Historian Richard J. Evans states that "historians now generally agree that his notorious, murderous anti-Semitism emerged well after Germany\'s defeat [in World War I], as a product of the paranoid "stab-in-the-back" explanation for the catastrophe".', u"Hitler received the final part of his father's estate in May 1913 and moved to Munich.", u'Historians believe he left Vienna to evade conscription into the Austro-Hungarian Army.', u'Hitler later claimed that he did not wish to serve Austria-Hungary because of the mixture of races in its armed forces.', u'After he was deemed unfit for service\u2014he failed his physical exam in Salzburg on 5 February 1914\u2014he returned to Munich.', u'=== World War I ===\n\nIn 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, Hitler was living in Munich and voluntarily enlisted in the Bavarian Army.', u'According to a 1924 report by the Bavarian authorities, allowing Hitler to serve was almost certainly an administrative error, since as an Austrian citizen, he should have been returned to Austria.', u'Posted to the Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 16 (1st Company of the List Regiment), he served as a dispatch runner on the Western Front in France and Belgium, spending nearly half his time at the regimental headquarters in Fournes-en-Weppes, well behind the front lines.', u'He was present at the First Battle of Ypres, the Battle of the Somme, the Battle of Arras, and the Battle of Passchendaele, and was wounded at the Somme.', u'He was decorated for bravery, receiving the Iron Cross, Second Class, in 1914.', u"On a recommendation by Lieutenant Hugo Gutmann, Hitler's Jewish superior, he received the Iron Cross, First Class on 4 August 1918, a decoration rarely awarded to one of Hitler's Gefreiter rank.", u'He received the Black Wound Badge on 18 May 1918.', u'During his service at headquarters, Hitler pursued his artwork, drawing cartoons and instructions for an army newspaper.', u"During the Battle of the Somme in October 1916, he was wounded in the left thigh when a shell exploded in the dispatch runners' dugout.", u'Hitler spent almost two months in hospital at Beelitz, returning to his regiment on 5 March 1917.', u'On 15 October 1918, he was temporarily blinded in a mustard gas attack and was hospitalised in Pasewalk.', u"While there, Hitler learnt of Germany's defeat, and\u2014by his own account\u2014upon receiving this news, he suffered a second bout of blindness.", u'Hitler described the war as "the greatest of all experiences", and was praised by his commanding officers for his bravery.', u"His wartime experience reinforced his German patriotism and he was shocked by Germany's capitulation in November 1918.", u'His bitterness over the collapse of the war effort began to shape his ideology.', u'Like other German nationalists, he believed the Dolchsto\xdflegende (stab-in-the-back myth), which claimed that the German army, "undefeated in the field", had been "stabbed in the back" on the home front by civilian leaders and Marxists, later dubbed the "November criminals".', u'The Treaty of Versailles stipulated that Germany must relinquish several of its territories and demilitarise the Rhineland.', u'The treaty imposed economic sanctions and levied heavy reparations on the country.', u'Many Germans saw the treaty as an unjust humiliation\u2014they especially objected to Article 231, which they interpreted as declaring Germany responsible for the war.', u'The Versailles Treaty and the economic, social, and political conditions in Germany after the war were later exploited by Hitler for political gain.', u'== Entry into politics ==\n\nAfter World War I, Hitler returned to Munich.', u'With no formal education or career prospects, he remained in the army.', u"In July 1919 he was appointed Verbindungsmann (intelligence agent) of an Aufkl\xe4rungskommando (reconnaissance commando) of the Reichswehr, assigned to influence other soldiers and to infiltrate the German Workers' Party (DAP).", u"While monitoring the activities of the DAP, Hitler was attracted to the founder Anton Drexler's anti-Semitic, nationalist, anti-capitalist, and anti-Marxist ideas.", u'Drexler favoured a strong active government, a non-Jewish version of socialism, and solidarity among all members of society.', u"Impressed with Hitler's oratorical skills, Drexler invited him to join the DAP.", u'Hitler accepted on 12 September 1919, becoming party member 555 (the party began counting membership at 500 to give the impression they were a much larger party).', u"At the DAP, Hitler met Dietrich Eckart, one of the party's founders and a member of the occult Thule Society.", u"Eckart became Hitler's mentor, exchanging ideas with him and introducing him to a wide range of Munich society.", u'To increase its appeal, the DAP changed its name to the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (National Socialist German Workers Party; NSDAP).', u"Hitler designed the party's banner of a swastika in a white circle on a red background.", u'Hitler was discharged from the army on 31 March 1920 and began working full-time for the NSDAP.', u'The party headquarters was in Munich, a hotbed of anti-government German nationalists determined to crush Marxism and undermine the Weimar Republic.', u'In February 1921\u2014already highly effective at speaking to large audiences\u2014he spoke to a crowd of over 6,000.', u'To publicise the meeting, two truckloads of party supporters drove around Munich waving swastika flags and distributing leaflets.', u'Hitler soon gained notoriety for his rowdy polemic speeches against the Treaty of Versailles, rival politicians, and especially against Marxists and Jews.', u'In June 1921, while Hitler and Eckart were on a fundraising trip to Berlin, a mutiny broke out within the NSDAP in Munich.', u'Members of its executive committee wanted to merge with the rival German Socialist Party (DSP).', u'Hitler returned to Munich on 11 July and angrily tendered his resignation.', u'The committee members realised that the resignation of their leading public figure and speaker would mean the end of the party.', u'Hitler announced he would rejoin on the condition that he would replace Drexler as party chairman, and that the party headquarters would remain in Munich.', u'The committee agreed, and he rejoined the party on 26 July as member 3,680.', u'Hitler continued to face some opposition within the NSDAP: Opponents of Hitler in the leadership had Hermann Esser expelled from the party, and they printed 3,000 copies of a pamphlet attacking Hitler as a traitor to the party.', u'In the following days, Hitler spoke to several packed houses and defended himself and Esser, to thunderous applause.', u'His strategy proved successful, and at a special party congress on 29 July, he was granted absolute powers as party chairman, replacing Drexler, by a vote of 533 to 1.', u"Hitler's vitriolic beer hall speeches began attracting regular audiences.", u"He became adept at using populist themes, including the use of scapegoats, who were blamed for his listeners' economic hardships.", u'Hitler used personal magnetism and an understanding of crowd psychology to his advantage while engaged in public speaking.', u'Historians have noted the hypnotic effect of his rhetoric on large audiences, and of his eyes in small groups.', u'Alfons Heck, a former member of the Hitler Youth, later recalled:\n\nWe erupted into a frenzy of nationalistic pride that bordered on hysteria.', u'For minutes on end, we shouted at the top of our lungs, with tears streaming down our faces: Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil!', u'From that moment on, I belonged to Adolf Hitler body and soul.', u'Some visitors who met Hitler privately noted that his appearance and demeanour failed to make a lasting impression.', u'Early followers included Rudolf Hess, former air force ace Hermann G\xf6ring, and army captain Ernst R\xf6hm.', u'R\xf6hm became head of the Nazis\' paramilitary organisation, the Sturmabteilung (SA, "Stormtroopers"), which protected meetings and attacked political opponents.', u"A critical influence on Hitler's thinking during this period was the Aufbau Vereinigung, a conspiratorial group of White Russian exiles and early National Socialists.", u'The group, financed with funds channelled from wealthy industrialists, introduced Hitler to the idea of a Jewish conspiracy, linking international finance with Bolshevism.', u'=== Beer Hall Putsch ===\n\nIn 1923 Hitler enlisted the help of World War I General Erich Ludendorff for an attempted coup known as the "Beer Hall Putsch".', u'The NSDAP used Italian Fascism as a model for their appearance and policies.', u'Hitler wanted to emulate Benito Mussolini\'s "March on Rome" of 1922 by staging his own coup in Bavaria, to be followed by a challenge to the government in Berlin.', u"Hitler and Ludendorff sought the support of Staatskommissar (state commissioner) Gustav Ritter von Kahr, Bavaria's de facto ruler.", u'However, Kahr, along with Police Chief Hans Ritter von Seisser and Reichswehr General Otto von Lossow, wanted to install a nationalist dictatorship without Hitler.', u'On 8 November 1923 Hitler and the SA stormed a public meeting of 3,000 people organised by Kahr in the B\xfcrgerbr\xe4ukeller, a beer hall in Munich.', u"Interrupting Kahr's speech, he announced that the national revolution had begun and declared the formation of a new government with Ludendorff.", u'Retiring to a back room, Hitler, with handgun drawn, demanded and got the support of Kahr, Seisser, and Lossow.', u"Hitler's forces initially succeeded in occupying the local Reichswehr and police headquarters, but Kahr and his cohorts quickly withdrew their support.", u'Neither the army nor the state police joined forces with Hitler.', u'The next day, Hitler and his followers marched from the beer hall to the Bavarian War Ministry to overthrow the Bavarian government, but police dispersed them.', u'Sixteen NSDAP members and four police officers were killed in the failed coup.', u'Hitler fled to the home of Ernst Hanfstaengl and by some accounts contemplated suicide.', u'He was depressed but calm when arrested on 11 November 1923 for high treason.', u"His trial before the special People's Court in Munich began in February 1924, and Alfred Rosenberg became temporary leader of the NSDAP.", u"On 1 April, Hitler was sentenced to five years' imprisonment at Landsberg Prison.", u'There, he received friendly treatment from the guards, and he was allowed mail from supporters and regular visits by party comrades.', u"Pardoned by the Bavarian Supreme Court, he was released from jail on 20 December 1924, against the state prosecutor's objections.", u'Including time on remand, Hitler served just over one year in prison.', u'While at Landsberg, Hitler dictated most of the first volume of Mein Kampf (My Struggle; originally entitled Four and a Half Years of Struggle against Lies, Stupidity, and Cowardice) to his deputy, Rudolf Hess.', u'The book, dedicated to Thule Society member Dietrich Eckart, was an autobiography and exposition of his ideology.', u"The book laid out Hitler's plans for transforming German society into one based on race.", u'Some passages implied genocide.', u'Published in two volumes in 1925 and 1926, it sold 228,000 copies between 1925 and 1932.', u"One million copies were sold in 1933, Hitler's first year in office.", u'Shortly before Hitler was eligible for parole, the Bavarian government attempted to have him deported back to Austria.', u'The Austrian federal chancellor rejected the request on the specious grounds that his service in the German Army made his Austrian citizenship void.', u'In response, Hitler formally renounced his Austrian citizenship on 7 April 1925.', u"=== Rebuilding the NSDAP ===\nAt the time of Hitler's release from prison, politics in Germany had become less combative and the economy had improved, limiting Hitler's opportunities for political agitation.", u'As a result of the failed Beer Hall Putsch, the NSDAP and its affiliated organisations were banned in Bavaria.', u'In a meeting with Prime Minister of Bavaria Heinrich Held on 4 January 1925, Hitler agreed to respect the authority of the state and promised that he would seek political power only through the democratic process.', u'The meeting paved the way for the ban on the NSDAP to be lifted on 16 February.', u'Hitler was barred from public speaking by the Bavarian authorities, a ban that remained in place until 1927.', u'To advance his political ambitions in spite of the ban, Hitler appointed Gregor Strasser, Otto Strasser, and Joseph Goebbels to organise and grow the NSDAP in northern Germany.', u"A superb organiser, Gregor Strasser steered a more independent political course, emphasising the socialist elements of the party's programme.", u'The stock market in the United States crashed on 24 October 1929.', u'The impact in Germany was dire: millions were thrown out of work and several major banks collapsed.', u'Hitler and the NSDAP prepared to take advantage of the emergency to gain support for their party.', u'They promised to repudiate the Versailles Treaty, strengthen the economy, and provide jobs.', u'== Rise to power ==\n\n\n=== Br\xfcning administration ===\nThe Great Depression provided a political opportunity for Hitler.', u'Germans were ambivalent about the parliamentary republic, which faced challenges from right- and left-wing extremists.', u'The moderate political parties were increasingly unable to stem the tide of extremism, and the German referendum of 1929 helped to elevate Nazi ideology.', u'The elections of September 1930 resulted in the break-up of a grand coalition and its replacement with a minority cabinet.', u'Its leader, chancellor Heinrich Br\xfcning of the Centre Party, governed through emergency decrees from President Paul von Hindenburg.', u'Governance by decree became the new norm and paved the way for authoritarian forms of government.', u'The NSDAP rose from obscurity to win 18.3 per cent of the vote and 107 parliamentary seats in the 1930 election, becoming the second-largest party in parliament.', u'Hitler made a prominent appearance at the trial of two Reichswehr officers, Lieutenants Richard Scheringer and Hans Ludin, in late 1930.', u'Both were charged with membership in the NSDAP, at that time illegal for Reichswehr personnel.', u'The prosecution argued that the NSDAP was an extremist party, prompting defence lawyer Hans Frank to call on Hitler to testify.', u'On 25 September 1930, Hitler testified that his party would pursue political power solely through democratic elections, which won him many supporters in the officer corps.', u"Br\xfcning's austerity measures brought little economic improvement and were extremely unpopular.", u'Hitler exploited this by targeting his political messages specifically at people who had been affected by the inflation of the 1920s and the Depression, such as farmers, war veterans, and the middle class.', u'Although Hitler had terminated his Austrian citizenship in 1925, he did not acquire German citizenship for almost seven years.', u'This meant he was stateless, unable to run for public office, and still faced the risk of deportation.', u"On 25 February 1932, the interior minister of Brunswick, Dietrich Klagges, who was a member of the NSDAP, appointed Hitler as administrator for the state's delegation to the Reichsrat in Berlin, making Hitler a citizen of Brunswick, and thus of Germany.", u'In 1932, Hitler ran against Hindenburg in the presidential elections.', u"A 27 January 1932 speech to the Industry Club in D\xfcsseldorf won him support from many of Germany's most powerful industrialists.", u'Hindenburg had support from various nationalist, monarchist, Catholic, and republican parties, and some Social Democrats.', u'Hitler used the campaign slogan "Hitler \xfcber Deutschland" ("Hitler over Germany"), a reference to his political ambitions and his campaigning by aircraft.', u'He was one of the first politicians to use aircraft travel for political purposes, and utilised it effectively.', u'Hitler came in second in both rounds of the election, garnering more than 35 per cent of the vote in the final election.', u'Although he lost to Hindenburg, this election established Hitler as a strong force in German politics.', u'=== Appointment as chancellor ===\nThe absence of an effective government prompted two influential politicians, Franz von Papen and Alfred Hugenberg, along with several other industrialists and businessmen, to write a letter to Hindenburg.', u'The signers urged Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as leader of a government "independent from parliamentary parties", which could turn into a movement that would "enrapture millions of people".', u'Hindenburg reluctantly agreed to appoint Hitler as chancellor after two further parliamentary elections\u2014in July and November 1932\u2014had not resulted in the formation of a majority government.', u"Hitler headed a short-lived coalition government formed by the NSDAP and Hugenberg's party, the German National People's Party (DNVP).", u"On 30 January 1933, the new cabinet was sworn in during a brief ceremony in Hindenburg's office.", u'The NSDAP gained three posts: Hitler was named chancellor, Wilhelm Frick Minister of the Interior, and Hermann G\xf6ring Minister of the Interior for Prussia.', u'Hitler had insisted on the ministerial positions as a way to gain control over the police in much of Germany.', u"=== Reichstag fire and March elections ===\nAs chancellor, Hitler worked against attempts by the NSDAP's opponents to build a majority government.", u'Because of the political stalemate, he asked Hindenburg to again dissolve the Reichstag, and elections were scheduled for early March.', u'On 27 February 1933, the Reichstag building was set on fire.', u'G\xf6ring blamed a communist plot, because Dutch communist Marinus van der Lubbe was found in incriminating circumstances inside the burning building.', u'According to the British historian Sir Ian Kershaw, the consensus of nearly all historians is that van der Lubbe actually set the fire.', u'Others, including William L. Shirer and Alan Bullock, are of the opinion that the NSDAP itself was responsible.', u"At Hitler's urging, Hindenburg responded with the Reichstag Fire Decree of 28 February, which suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial.", u'The decree was permitted under Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution, which gave the president the power to take emergency measures to protect public safety and order.', u'Activities of the German Communist Party (KPD) were suppressed, and some 4,000 communist party members were arrested.', u'In addition to political campaigning, the NSDAP engaged in paramilitary violence and the spread of anti-communist propaganda in the days preceding the election.', u"On election day, 6 March 1933, the NSDAP's share of the vote increased to 43.9 per cent, and the party acquired the largest number of seats in parliament.", u"Hitler's party failed to secure an absolute majority, necessitating another coalition with the DNVP.", u'=== Day of Potsdam and the Enabling Act ===\n\nOn 21 March 1933, the new Reichstag was constituted with an opening ceremony at the Garrison Church in Potsdam.', u'This "Day of Potsdam" was held to demonstrate unity between the Nazi movement and the old Prussian elite and military.', u'Hitler appeared in a morning coat and humbly greeted Hindenburg.', u"To achieve full political control despite not having an absolute majority in parliament, Hitler's government brought the Erm\xe4chtigungsgesetz (Enabling Act) to a vote in the newly elected Reichstag.", u'The Act\u2014officially titled the Gesetz zur Behebung der Not von Volk und Reich ("Law to Remedy the Distress of People and Reich")\u2014gave Hitler\'s cabinet the power to enact laws without the consent of the Reichstag for four years.', u'These laws could (with certain exceptions) deviate from the constitution.', u'Since it would affect the constitution, the Enabling Act required a two-thirds majority to pass.', u'Leaving nothing to chance, the Nazis used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to arrest all 81 Communist deputies (in spite of their virulent campaign against the party, the Nazis had allowed the KPD to contest the election) and prevent several Social Democrats from attending.', u'On 23 March 1933, the Reichstag assembled at the Kroll Opera House under turbulent circumstances.', u'Ranks of SA men served as guards inside the building, while large groups outside opposing the proposed legislation shouted slogans and threats towards the arriving members of parliament.', u'The position of the Centre Party, the third largest party in the Reichstag, was decisive.', u'After Hitler verbally promised party leader Ludwig Kaas that Hindenburg would retain his power of veto, Kaas announced the Centre Party would support the Enabling Act.', u'The Act passed by a vote of 441\u201384, with all parties except the Social Democrats voting in favour.', u"The Enabling Act, along with the Reichstag Fire Decree, transformed Hitler's government into a de facto legal dictatorship.", u'=== Dictatorship ===\n\nAt the risk of appearing to talk nonsense I tell you that the National Socialist movement will go on for 1,000 years!', u"... Don't forget how people laughed at me 15 years ago when I declared that one day I would govern Germany.", u'They laugh now, just as foolishly, when I declare that I shall remain in power!', u'Having achieved full control over the legislative and executive branches of government, Hitler and his allies began to suppress the remaining opposition.', u'The Social Democratic Party was banned and its assets seized.', u'While many trade union delegates were in Berlin for May Day activities, SA stormtroopers demolished union offices around the country.', u'On 2 May 1933 all trade unions were forced to dissolve and their leaders were arrested.', u'Some were sent to concentration camps.', u'The German Labour Front was formed as an umbrella organisation to represent all workers, administrators, and company owners, thus reflecting the concept of national socialism in the spirit of Hitler\'s Volksgemeinschaft ("people\'s community").', u'By the end of June, the other parties had been intimidated into disbanding.', u"This included the Nazis' nominal coalition partner, the DNVP; with the SA's help, Hitler forced its leader, Hugenberg, to resign on 29 June.", u'On 14 July 1933, the NSDAP was declared the only legal political party in Germany.', u'The demands of the SA for more political and military power caused anxiety among military, industrial, and political leaders.', u'In response, Hitler purged the entire SA leadership in the Night of the Long Knives, which took place from 30 June to 2 July 1934.', u"Hitler targeted Ernst R\xf6hm and other SA leaders who, along with a number of Hitler's political adversaries (such as Gregor Strasser and former chancellor Kurt von Schleicher), were rounded up, arrested, and shot.", u'While the international community and some Germans were shocked by the murders, many in Germany believed Hitler was restoring order.', u'On 2 August 1934, Hindenburg died.', u'The previous day, the cabinet had enacted the "Law Concerning the Highest State Office of the Reich".', u"This law stated that upon Hindenburg's death, the office of president would be abolished and its powers merged with those of the chancellor.", u'Hitler thus became head of state as well as head of government, and was formally named as F\xfchrer und Reichskanzler (leader and chancellor).', u'With this action, Hitler eliminated the last legal remedy by which he could be removed from office.', u'As head of state, Hitler became supreme commander of the armed forces.', u'The traditional loyalty oath of servicemen was altered to affirm loyalty to Hitler personally, by name, rather than to the office of supreme commander or the state.', u'On 19 August, the merger of the presidency with the chancellorship was approved by 90 per cent of the electorate voting in a plebiscite.', u'In early 1938, Hitler used blackmail to consolidate his hold over the military by instigating the Blomberg\u2013Fritsch Affair.', u"Hitler forced his War Minister, Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg, to resign by using a police dossier that showed that Blomberg's new wife had a record for prostitution.", u'Army commander Colonel-General Werner von Fritsch was removed after the Schutzstaffel (SS) produced allegations that he had engaged in a homosexual relationship.', u"Both men had fallen into disfavour because they objected to Hitler's demand to make the Wehrmacht ready for war as early as 1938.", u"Hitler assumed Blomberg's title of Commander-in-Chief, thus taking personal command of the armed forces.", u'He replaced the Ministry of War with the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Armed Forces High Command: OKW), headed by General Wilhelm Keitel.', u'On the same day, sixteen generals were stripped of their commands and 44 more were transferred; all were suspected of not being sufficiently pro-Nazi.', u'By early February 1938, twelve more generals had been removed.', u'Hitler took care to give his dictatorship the appearance of legality.', u'Many of his decrees were explicitly based on the Reichstag Fire Decree and hence on Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution.', u'The Reichstag renewed the Enabling Act twice, each time for a four-year period.', u'While elections to the Reichstag were still held (in 1933, 1936, and 1938), voters were presented with a single list of Nazis and pro-Nazi "guests" which carried with well over 90 percent of the vote.', u"These elections were held in far-from-secret conditions; the Nazis threatened severe reprisals against anyone who didn't vote or dared to vote no.", u'== Nazi Germany ==\n\n\n=== Economy and culture ===\n\nIn August 1934, Hitler appointed Reichsbank President Hjalmar Schacht as Minister of Economics, and in the following year, as Plenipotentiary for War Economy in charge of preparing the economy for war.', u'Reconstruction and rearmament were financed through Mefo bills, printing money, and seizing the assets of people arrested as enemies of the State, including Jews.', u'Unemployment fell from six million in 1932 to one million in 1936.', u'Hitler oversaw one of the largest infrastructure improvement campaigns in German history, leading to the construction of dams, autobahns, railroads, and other civil works.', u'Wages were slightly lower in the mid to late 1930s compared with wages during the Weimar Republic, while the cost of living increased by 25 per cent.', u'The average work week increased during the shift to a war economy; by 1939, the average German was working between 47 and 50 hours a week.', u"Hitler's government sponsored architecture on an immense scale.", u"Albert Speer, instrumental in implementing Hitler's classicist reinterpretation of German culture, was placed in charge of the proposed architectural renovations of Berlin.", u'Despite a threatened multi-nation boycott, Germany hosted the 1936 Olympic Games.', u'Hitler officiated at the opening ceremonies and attended events at both the Winter Games in Garmisch-Partenkirchen and the Summer Games in Berlin.', u'=== Rearmament and new alliances ===\n\nIn a meeting with German military leaders on 3 February 1933, Hitler spoke of "conquest for Lebensraum in the East and its ruthless Germanisation" as his ultimate foreign policy objectives.', u"In March, Prince Bernhard Wilhelm von B\xfclow, secretary at the Ausw\xe4rtiges Amt (Foreign Office), issued a statement of major foreign policy aims: Anschluss with Austria, the restoration of Germany's national borders of 1914, rejection of military restrictions under the Treaty of Versailles, the return of the former German colonies in Africa, and a German zone of influence in Eastern Europe.", u"Hitler found B\xfclow's goals to be too modest.", u'In speeches during this period, he stressed the peaceful goals of his policies and a willingness to work within international agreements.', u'At the first meeting of his cabinet in 1933, Hitler prioritised military spending over unemployment relief.', u'Germany withdrew from the League of Nations and the World Disarmament Conference in October 1933.', u'In January 1935, over 90 per cent of the people of the Saarland, then under League of Nations administration, voted to unite with Germany.', u'That March, Hitler announced an expansion of the Wehrmacht to 600,000 members\u2014six times the number permitted by the Versailles Treaty\u2014including development of an air force (Luftwaffe) and an increase in the size of the navy (Kriegsmarine).', u'Britain, France, Italy, and the League of Nations condemned these violations of the Treaty, but did nothing to stop it.', u'The Anglo-German Naval Agreement (AGNA) of 18 June allowed German tonnage to increase to 35 per cent of that of the British navy.', u'Hitler called the signing of the AGNA "the happiest day of his life", believing that the agreement marked the beginning of the Anglo-German alliance he had predicted in Mein Kampf.', u'France and Italy were not consulted before the signing, directly undermining the League of Nations and setting the Treaty of Versailles on the path towards irrelevance.', u'Germany reoccupied the demilitarised zone in the Rhineland in March 1936, in violation of the Versailles Treaty.', u'Hitler also sent troops to Spain to support General Franco during the Spanish Civil War after receiving an appeal for help in July 1936.', u'At the same time, Hitler continued his efforts to create an Anglo-German alliance.', u'In August 1936, in response to a growing economic crisis caused by his rearmament efforts, Hitler ordered G\xf6ring to implement a Four Year Plan to prepare Germany for war within the next four years.', u'The plan envisaged an all-out struggle between "Judeo-Bolshevism" and German national socialism, which in Hitler\'s view required a committed effort of rearmament regardless of the economic costs.', u"Count Galeazzo Ciano, foreign minister of Mussolini's government, declared an axis between Germany and Italy, and on 25 November, Germany signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan.", u'Britain, China, Italy, and Poland were also invited to join the Anti-Comintern Pact, but only Italy signed in 1937.', u'Hitler abandoned his plan of an Anglo-German alliance, blaming "inadequate" British leadership.', u'At a meeting in the Reich Chancellery with his foreign ministers and military chiefs that November, Hitler restated his intention of acquiring Lebensraum for the German people.', u'He ordered preparations for war in the East, to begin as early as 1938 and no later than 1943.', u'In the event of his death, the conference minutes, recorded as the Hossbach Memorandum, were to be regarded as his "political testament".', u'He felt that a severe decline in living standards in Germany as a result of the economic crisis could only be stopped by military aggression aimed at seizing Austria and Czechoslovakia.', u'Hitler urged quick action before Britain and France gained a permanent lead in the arms race.', u'In early 1938, in the wake of the Blomberg\u2013Fritsch Affair, Hitler asserted control of the military-foreign policy apparatus, dismissing Neurath as foreign minister and appointing himself Oberster Befehlshaber der Wehrmacht (supreme commander of the armed forces).', u'From early 1938 onwards, Hitler was carrying out a foreign policy ultimately aimed at war.', u'== World War II ==\n\n\n=== Early diplomatic successes ===\n\n\n==== Alliance with Japan ====\n\nIn February 1938, on the advice of his newly appointed foreign minister, the strongly pro-Japanese Joachim von Ribbentrop, Hitler ended the Sino-German alliance with the Republic of China to instead enter into an alliance with the more modern and powerful Japan.', u'Hitler announced German recognition of Manchukuo, the Japanese-occupied state in Manchuria, and renounced German claims to their former colonies in the Pacific held by Japan.', u'Hitler ordered an end to arms shipments to China and recalled all German officers working with the Chinese Army.', u'In retaliation, Chinese General Chiang Kai-shek cancelled all Sino-German economic agreements, depriving the Germans of many Chinese raw materials.', u'==== Austria and Czechoslovakia ====\nOn 12 March 1938, Hitler announced the unification of Austria with Nazi Germany in the Anschluss.', u'Hitler then turned his attention to the ethnic German population of the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia.', u'On 28\u201329 March 1938, Hitler held a series of secret meetings in Berlin with Konrad Henlein of the Sudeten Heimfront (Home Front), the largest of the ethnic German parties of the Sudetenland.', u'The men agreed that Henlein would demand increased autonomy for Sudeten Germans from the Czechoslovakian government, thus providing a pretext for German military action against Czechoslovakia.', u'In April 1938 Henlein told the foreign minister of Hungary that "whatever the Czech government might offer, he would always raise still higher demands ... he wanted to sabotage an understanding by any means because this was the only method to blow up Czechoslovakia quickly".', u'In private, Hitler considered the Sudeten issue unimportant; his real intention was a war of conquest against Czechoslovakia.', u'In April Hitler ordered the OKW to prepare for Fall Gr\xfcn (Case Green), the code name for an invasion of Czechoslovakia.', u'As a result of intense French and British diplomatic pressure, on 5 September Czechoslovakian President Edvard Bene\u0161 unveiled the "Fourth Plan" for constitutional reorganisation of his country, which agreed to most of Henlein\'s demands for Sudeten autonomy.', u"Henlein's Heimfront responded to Bene\u0161' offer by instigating a series of violent clashes with the Czechoslovakian police that led to the declaration of martial law in certain Sudeten districts.", u"Germany was dependent on imported oil; a confrontation with Britain over the Czechoslovakian dispute could curtail Germany's oil supplies.", u'This forced Hitler to call off Fall Gr\xfcn, originally planned for 1 October 1938.', u'On 29 September Hitler, Neville Chamberlain, \xc9douard Daladier, and Mussolini attended a one-day conference in Munich that led to the Munich Agreement, which handed over the Sudetenland districts to Germany.', u'Chamberlain was satisfied with the Munich conference, calling the outcome "peace for our time", while Hitler was angered about the missed opportunity for war in 1938; he expressed his disappointment in a speech on 9 October in Saarbr\xfccken.', u"In Hitler's view, the British-brokered peace, although favourable to the ostensible German demands, was a diplomatic defeat which spurred his intent of limiting British power to pave the way for the eastern expansion of Germany.", u"As a result of the summit, Hitler was selected Time magazine's Man of the Year for 1938.", u'In late 1938 and early 1939, the continuing economic crisis caused by rearmament forced Hitler to make major defence cuts.', u'In his "Export or die" speech of 30 January 1939, he called for an economic offensive to increase German foreign exchange holdings to pay for raw materials such as high-grade iron needed for military weapons.', u'On 15 March 1939, in violation of the Munich accord and possibly as a result of the deepening economic crisis requiring additional assets, Hitler ordered the Wehrmacht to invade Prague, and from Prague Castle he proclaimed Bohemia and Moravia a German protectorate.', u"=== Start of World War II ===\nIn private discussions in 1939, Hitler declared Britain the main enemy to be defeated and that Poland's obliteration was a necessary prelude for that goal.", u"The eastern flank would be secured and land would be added to Germany's Lebensraum.", u'Offended by the British "guarantee" on 31 March 1939 of Polish independence, he said, "I shall brew them a devil\'s drink".', u'In a speech in Wilhelmshaven for the launch of the battleship Tirpitz on 1 April, he threatened to denounce the Anglo-German Naval Agreement if the British continued to guarantee Polish independence, which he perceived as an "encirclement" policy.', u"Poland was to either become a German satellite state or be neutralised to secure the Reich's eastern flank and to prevent a possible British blockade.", u'Hitler initially favoured the idea of a satellite state, but upon its rejection by the Polish government, he decided to invade and made this the main foreign policy goal of 1939.', u'On 3 April, Hitler ordered the military to prepare for Fall Weiss ("Case White"), the plan for invading Poland on 25 August.', u'In a Reichstag speech on 28 April, he renounced both the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the German\u2013Polish Non-Aggression Pact.', u"Historians such as William Carr, Gerhard Weinberg, and Kershaw have argued that one reason for Hitler's rush to war was his fear of an early death.", u'Hitler was concerned that a military attack against Poland could result in a premature war with Britain.', u"Hitler's foreign minister and former Ambassador to London, Joachim von Ribbentrop, assured him that neither Britain nor France would honour their commitments to Poland.", u'Accordingly, on 22 August 1939 Hitler ordered a military mobilisation against Poland.', u'This plan required tacit Soviet support, and the non-aggression pact (the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact) between Germany and the Soviet Union, led by Joseph Stalin, included a secret agreement to partition Poland between the two countries.', u"Contrary to Ribbentrop's prediction that Britain would sever Anglo-Polish ties, Britain and Poland signed the Anglo-Polish alliance on 25 August 1939.", u'This, along with news from Italy that Mussolini would not honour the Pact of Steel, prompted Hitler to postpone the attack on Poland from 25 August to 1 September.', u'Hitler unsuccessfully tried to manoeuvre the British into neutrality by offering them a non-aggression guarantee on 25 August; he then instructed Ribbentrop to present a last-minute peace plan with an impossibly short time limit in an effort to blame the imminent war on British and Polish inaction.', u'On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded western Poland under the pretext of having been denied claims to the Free City of Danzig and the right to extraterritorial roads across the Polish Corridor, which Germany had ceded under the Versailles Treaty.', u'In response, Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September, surprising Hitler and prompting him to angrily ask Ribbentrop, "Now what?"', u'France and Britain did not act on their declarations immediately, and on 17 September, Soviet forces invaded eastern Poland.', u'The fall of Poland was followed by what contemporary journalists dubbed the "Phoney War" or Sitzkrieg ("sitting war").', u'Hitler instructed the two newly appointed Gauleiters of north-western Poland, Albert Forster of Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia and Arthur Greiser of Reichsgau Wartheland, to Germanise their areas, with "no questions asked" about how this was accomplished.', u"Whereas Polish citizens in Forster's area merely had to sign forms stating that they had German blood, Greiser carried out a brutal ethnic cleansing campaign on the Polish population in his purview.", u'Greiser complained that Forster was allowing thousands of Poles to be accepted as "racial" Germans and thus endangered German "racial purity".', u'Hitler refrained from getting involved.', u'This inaction has been advanced as an example of the theory of "working towards the F\xfchrer": Hitler issued vague instructions and expected his subordinates to work out policies on their own.', u'Another dispute pitched one side represented by Himmler and Greiser, who championed ethnic cleansing in Poland, against another represented by G\xf6ring and Hans Frank, governor-general of the General Government territory of occupied Poland, who called for turning Poland into the "granary" of the Reich.', u'On 12 February 1940, the dispute was initially settled in favour of the G\xf6ring\u2013Frank view, which ended the economically disruptive mass expulsions.', u'On 15 May 1940, Himmler issued a memo entitled "Some Thoughts on the Treatment of Alien Population in the East", calling for the expulsion of the entire Jewish population of Europe into Africa and reducing the Polish population to a "leaderless class of labourers".', u'Hitler called Himmler\'s memo "good and correct", and, ignoring G\xf6ring and Frank, implemented the Himmler\u2013Greiser policy in Poland.', u"Hitler began a military build-up on Germany's western border, and in April 1940, German forces invaded Denmark and Norway.", u'On 9 April, Hitler proclaimed the birth of the Greater Germanic Reich, his vision of a united empire of the Germanic nations of Europe, where the Dutch, Flemish, and Scandinavians were joined into a "racially pure" polity under German leadership.', u'In May 1940, Germany attacked France, and conquered Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Belgium.', u'These victories prompted Mussolini to have Italy join forces with Hitler on 10 June.', u'France and Germany signed an armistice on 22 June.', u"Kershaw notes that Hitler's popularity within Germany \u2013 and German support for the war \u2013 reached its peak when he returned to Berlin on 6 July from his tour of Paris.", u'Following the unexpected swift victory, Hitler promoted twelve generals to the rank of field marshal during the 1940 Field Marshal Ceremony.', u'Britain, whose troops were forced to evacuate France by sea from Dunkirk, continued to fight alongside other British dominions in the Battle of the Atlantic.', u'Hitler made peace overtures to the new British leader, Winston Churchill, and upon their rejection he ordered a series of aerial attacks on Royal Air Force airbases and radar stations in south-east England.', u'The German Luftwaffe failed to defeat the Royal Air Force in what became known as the Battle of Britain.', u'By the end of October, Hitler realised that air superiority for the invasion of Britain (in Operation Sea Lion) could not be achieved, and he ordered nightly air raids on British cities, including London, Plymouth, and Coventry.', u'On 27 September 1940, the Tripartite Pact was signed in Berlin by Sabur\u014d Kurusu of Imperial Japan, Hitler, and Italian foreign minister Ciano, and later expanded to include Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, thus yielding the Axis powers.', u"Hitler's attempt to integrate the Soviet Union into the anti-British bloc failed after inconclusive talks between Hitler and Molotov in Berlin in November, and he ordered preparations for the invasion of the Soviet Union.", u'In early 1941, German forces were deployed to North Africa, the Balkans, and the Middle East.', u'In February, German forces arrived in Libya to bolster the Italian presence.', u'In April, Hitler launched the invasion of Yugoslavia, quickly followed by the invasion of Greece.', u'In May, German forces were sent to support Iraqi rebel forces fighting against the British and to invade Crete.', u'=== Path to defeat ===\nOn 22 June 1941, contravening the Hitler\u2013Stalin Non-Aggression Pact of 1939, 4\u20135 million Axis troops attacked the Soviet Union.', u'This offensive (codenamed Operation Barbarossa) was intended to destroy the Soviet Union and seize its natural resources for subsequent aggression against the Western powers.', u'The invasion conquered a huge area, including the Baltic republics, Belarus, and West Ukraine.', u'By early August, Axis troops had advanced 500 km (310 mi) and won the Battle of Smolensk.', u'Hitler ordered Army Group Centre to temporarily halt its advance to Moscow and divert its Panzer groups to aid in the encirclement of Leningrad and Kiev.', u'His generals disagreed with this change, having advanced within 400 km (250 mi) of Moscow, and his decision caused a crisis among the military leadership.', u'The pause provided the Red Army with an opportunity to mobilise fresh reserves; historian Russel Stolfi considers it to be one of the major factors that caused the failure of the Moscow offensive, which was resumed in October 1941 and ended disastrously in December.', u'On 7 December 1941, Japan attacked the American fleet based at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.', u'Four days later, Hitler declared war against the United States.', u'On 18 December 1941, Himmler asked Hitler, "What to do with the Jews of Russia?', u'", to which Hitler replied, "als Partisanen auszurotten" ("exterminate them as partisans").', u'Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer has commented that the remark is probably as close as historians will ever get to a definitive order from Hitler for the genocide carried out during the Holocaust.', u"In late 1942, German forces were defeated in the second battle of El Alamein, thwarting Hitler's plans to seize the Suez Canal and the Middle East.", u'Overconfident in his own military expertise following the earlier victories in 1940, Hitler became distrustful of his Army High Command and began to interfere in military and tactical planning, with damaging consequences.', u"In December 1942 and January 1943, Hitler's repeated refusal to allow their withdrawal at the Battle of Stalingrad led to the almost total destruction of the 6th Army.", u'Over 200,000 Axis soldiers were killed and 235,000 were taken prisoner.', u'Thereafter came a decisive strategic defeat at the Battle of Kursk.', u"Hitler's military judgement became increasingly erratic, and Germany's military and economic position deteriorated, as did Hitler's health.", u'Following the allied invasion of Sicily in 1943, Mussolini was removed from power by Victor Emmanuel III after a vote of no confidence of the Grand Council.', u'Marshal Pietro Badoglio, placed in charge of the government, soon surrendered to the Allies.', u"Throughout 1943 and 1944, the Soviet Union steadily forced Hitler's armies into retreat along the Eastern Front.", u'On 6 June 1944, the Western Allied armies landed in northern France in one of the largest amphibious operations in history, Operation Overlord.', u"Many German officers concluded that defeat was inevitable and that continuing under Hitler's leadership would result in the complete destruction of the country.", u'Between 1939 and 1945, there were many plans to assassinate Hitler, some of which proceeded to significant degrees.', u'The most well known came from within Germany and was at least partly driven by the increasing prospect of a German defeat in the war.', u"In July 1944, in the 20 July plot, part of Operation Valkyrie, Claus von Stauffenberg planted a bomb in one of Hitler's headquarters, the Wolf's Lair at Rastenburg.", u'Hitler narrowly survived because staff officer Heinz Brandt moved the briefcase containing the bomb behind a leg of the heavy conference table, which deflected much of the blast.', u'Later, Hitler ordered savage reprisals resulting in the execution of more than 4,900 people.', u'=== Defeat and death ===\n\nBy late 1944, both the Red Army and the Western Allies were advancing into Germany.', u'Recognising the strength and determination of the Red Army, Hitler decided to use his remaining mobile reserves against the American and British troops, which he perceived as far weaker.', u'On 16 December, he launched the Ardennes Offensive to incite disunity among the Western Allies and perhaps convince them to join his fight against the Soviets.', u'The offensive failed after some temporary successes.', u'With much of Germany in ruins in January 1945, Hitler spoke on the radio: "However grave as the crisis may be at this moment, it will, despite everything, be mastered by our unalterable will."', u"Hitler's hope to negotiate peace with the United States and Britain was encouraged by the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt on 12 April 1945, but contrary to his expectations, this caused no rift among the Allies.", u"Acting on his view that Germany's military failures meant it had forfeited its right to survive as a nation, Hitler ordered the destruction of all German industrial infrastructure before it could fall into Allied hands.", u'Minister for Armaments Albert Speer was entrusted with executing this scorched earth policy, but he secretly disobeyed the order.', u"On 20 April, his 56th birthday, Hitler made his last trip from the F\xfchrerbunker (F\xfchrer's shelter) to the surface.", u'In the ruined garden of the Reich Chancellery, he awarded Iron Crosses to boy soldiers of the Hitler Youth, who were now fighting the Red Army at the front near Berlin.', u"By 21 April, Georgy Zhukov's 1st Belorussian Front had broken through the defences of General Gotthard Heinrici's Army Group Vistula during the Battle of the Seelow Heights and advanced to the outskirts of Berlin.", u'In denial about the dire situation, Hitler placed his hopes on the undermanned and under-equipped Armeeabteilung Steiner (Army Detachment Steiner), commanded by Waffen SS General Felix Steiner.', u'Hitler ordered Steiner to attack the northern flank of the salient, while the German Ninth Army was ordered to attack northward in a pincer attack.', u"During a military conference on 22 April, Hitler asked about Steiner's offensive.", u'He was told that the attack had not been launched and that the Soviets had entered Berlin.', u'Hitler asked everyone except Wilhelm Keitel, Alfred Jodl, Hans Krebs, and Wilhelm Burgdorf to leave the room, then launched into a tirade against the treachery and incompetence of his commanders, culminating in his declaration\u2014for the first time\u2014that "everything was lost".', u'He announced that he would stay in Berlin until the end and then shoot himself.', u'By 23 April the Red Army had surrounded Berlin, and Goebbels made a proclamation urging its citizens to defend the city.', u'That same day, G\xf6ring sent a telegram from Berchtesgaden, arguing that since Hitler was isolated in Berlin, G\xf6ring should assume leadership of Germany.', u'G\xf6ring set a deadline, after which he would consider Hitler incapacitated.', u'Hitler responded by having G\xf6ring arrested, and in his last will and testament, written on 29 April, he removed G\xf6ring from all government positions.', u'On 28 April Hitler discovered that Himmler, who had left Berlin on 20 April, was trying to negotiate a surrender to the Western Allies.', u"He ordered Himmler's arrest and had Hermann Fegelein (Himmler's SS representative at Hitler's HQ in Berlin) shot.", u'After midnight on 29 April, Hitler married Eva Braun in a small civil ceremony in the F\xfchrerbunker.', u'After a wedding breakfast with his new wife, Hitler dictated his will to his secretary Traudl Junge.', u'The event was witnessed and documents signed by Krebs, Burgdorf, Goebbels, and Bormann.', u'Later that afternoon, Hitler was informed of the execution of Mussolini, which presumably increased his determination to avoid capture.', u'On 30 April 1945, when Soviet troops were within a block or two of the Reich Chancellery, Hitler shot himself and Braun bit into a cyanide capsule.', u'Their bodies were carried outside to the bombed-out garden behind the Reich Chancellery, where they were placed in a bomb crater and doused with petrol.', u'The corpses were set on fire as the Red Army shelling continued.', u"Grand Admiral Karl D\xf6nitz and Joseph Goebbels assumed Hitler's roles as head of state and chancellor respectively.", u'Berlin surrendered on 2 May.', u"Records in the Soviet archives obtained after the fall of the Soviet Union state that the remains of Hitler, Braun, Joseph and Magda Goebbels, the six Goebbels children, General Hans Krebs, and Hitler's dogs were repeatedly buried and exhumed.", u'On 4 April 1970, a Soviet KGB team used detailed burial charts to exhume five wooden boxes at the SMERSH facility in Magdeburg.', u'The remains from the boxes were burned, crushed, and scattered into the Biederitz river, a tributary of the Elbe.', u"According to Kershaw, the corpses of Braun and Hitler were fully burned when the Red Army found them, and only a lower jaw with dental work could be identified as Hitler's remains.", u'=== The Holocaust ===\n\nIf the international Jewish financiers in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war, then the result will not be the Bolshevisation of the earth, and thus the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe!', u"The Holocaust and Germany's war in the East were based on Hitler's long-standing view that the Jews were the enemy of the German people and that Lebensraum was needed for Germany's expansion.", u'He focused on Eastern Europe for this expansion, aiming to defeat Poland and the Soviet Union and then removing or killing the Jews and Slavs.', u'The Generalplan Ost (General Plan East) called for deporting the population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to West Siberia, for use as slave labour or to be murdered; the conquered territories were to be colonised by German or "Germanised" settlers.', u'The goal was to implement this plan after the conquest of the Soviet Union, but when this failed, Hitler moved the plans forward.', u'By January 1942, he had decided that the Jews, Slavs, and other deportees considered undesirable should be killed.', u'The genocide was ordered by Hitler and organised and executed by Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich.', u'The records of the Wannsee Conference, held on 20 January 1942 and led by Heydrich, with fifteen senior Nazi officials participating, provide the clearest evidence of systematic planning for the Holocaust.', u'On 22 February, Hitler was recorded saying, "we shall regain our health only by eliminating the Jews".', u'Although no direct order from Hitler authorising the mass killings has surfaced, his public speeches, orders to his generals, and the diaries of Nazi officials demonstrate that he conceived and authorised the extermination of European Jewry.', u'He approved the Einsatzgruppen\u2014killing squads that followed the German army through Poland, the Baltic, and the Soviet Union\u2014and was well informed about their activities.', u'By summer 1942, Auschwitz concentration camp was expanded to accommodate large numbers of deportees for killing or enslavement.', u'Scores of other concentration camps and satellite camps were set up throughout Europe, with several camps devoted exclusively to extermination.', u'Between 1939 and 1945, the Schutzstaffel (SS), assisted by collaborationist governments and recruits from occupied countries, was responsible for the deaths of at least eleven million people, including 5.5 to 6 million Jews (representing two-thirds of the Jewish population of Europe), and between 200,000 and 1,500,000 Romani people.', u'Deaths took place in concentration and extermination camps, ghettos, and through mass executions.', u'Many victims of the Holocaust were gassed to death, whereas others died of starvation or disease or while working as slave labourers.', u'In addition to eliminating Jews, the Nazis planned to reduce the population of the conquered territories by 30 million people through starvation in an action called the Hunger Plan.', u'Food supplies would be diverted to the German army and German civilians.', u'Cities would be razed and the land allowed to return to forest or resettled by German colonists.', u'Together, the Hunger Plan and Generalplan Ost would have led to the starvation of 80 million people in the Soviet Union.', u'These partially fulfilled plans resulted in the democidal deaths of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war.', u"Hitler's policies resulted in the killing of nearly two million Poles, over three million Soviet prisoners of war, communists and other political opponents, homosexuals, the physically and mentally disabled, Jehovah's Witnesses, Adventists, and trade unionists.", u'Hitler did not speak publicly about the killings, and seems never to have visited the concentration camps.', u'The Nazis embraced the concept of racial hygiene.', u'On 15 September 1935, Hitler presented two laws\u2014known as the Nuremberg Laws\u2014to the Reichstag.', u'The laws banned sexual relations and marriages between Aryans and Jews and were later extended to include "Gypsies, Negroes or their bastard offspring".', u'The laws stripped all non-Aryans of their German citizenship and forbade the employment of non-Jewish women under the age of 45 in Jewish households.', u"Hitler's early eugenic policies targeted children with physical and developmental disabilities in a programme dubbed Action Brandt, and he later authorised a euthanasia programme for adults with serious mental and physical disabilities, now referred to as Action T4.", u'== Leadership style ==\nHitler ruled the NSDAP autocratically by asserting the F\xfchrerprinzip (leader principle).', u'The principle relied on absolute obedience of all subordinates to their superiors; thus he viewed the government structure as a pyramid, with himself\u2014the infallible leader\u2014at the apex.', u'Rank in the party was not determined by elections\u2014positions were filled through appointment by those of higher rank, who demanded unquestioning obedience to the will of the leader.', u'Hitler\'s leadership style was to give contradictory orders to his subordinates and to place them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped with those of others, to have "the stronger one [do] the job".', u'In this way, Hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power.', u'His cabinet never met after 1938, and he discouraged his ministers from meeting independently.', u'Hitler typically did not give written orders; instead he communicated verbally, or had them conveyed through his close associate, Martin Bormann.', u'He entrusted Bormann with his paperwork, appointments, and personal finances; Bormann used his position to control the flow of information and access to Hitler.', u"Hitler dominated his country's war effort during World War II to a greater extent than any other national leader.", u"He assumed the role of supreme commander of the armed forces during 1938, and subsequently made all major decisions regarding Germany's military strategy.", u'His decision to mount a risky series of offensives against Norway, France, and the Low Countries in 1940 against the advice of the military proved successful, though the diplomatic and military strategies he employed in attempts to force the United Kingdom out of the war ended in failure.', u'Hitler deepened his involvement in the war effort by appointing himself commander-in-chief of the Army in December 1941; from this point forward he personally directed the war against the Soviet Union, while his military commanders facing the Western Allies retained a degree of autonomy.', u"Hitler's leadership became increasingly disconnected from reality as the war turned against Germany, with the military's defensive strategies often hindered by his slow decision making and frequent directives to hold untenable positions.", u'Nevertheless, he continued to believe that only his leadership could deliver victory.', u'In the final months of the war Hitler refused to consider peace negotiations, regarding the complete destruction of Germany as preferable to surrender.', u"The military did not challenge Hitler's dominance of the war effort, and senior officers generally supported and enacted his decisions.", u'== Legacy ==\n\nHitler\'s suicide was likened by contemporaries to a "spell" being broken.', u'Public support for Hitler had collapsed by the time of his death and few Germans mourned his passing; Kershaw argues that most civilians and military personnel were too busy adjusting to the collapse of the country or fleeing from the fighting to take any interest.', u'According to historian John Toland, National Socialism "burst like a bubble" without its leader.', u'Hitler\'s actions and Nazi ideology are almost universally regarded as gravely immoral; according to Kershaw, "Never in history has such ruination\u2014physical and moral\u2014been associated with the name of one man".', u"Hitler's political programme brought about a world war, leaving behind a devastated and impoverished Eastern and Central Europe.", u'Germany itself suffered wholesale destruction, characterised as Stunde Null (Zero Hour).', u"Hitler's policies inflicted human suffering on an unprecedented scale; according to R. J. Rummel, the Nazi regime was responsible for the democidal killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war.", u'In addition, 29 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European Theatre of World War II.', u'The number of civilians killed during the Second World War was unprecedented in the history of warfare.', u'Historians, philosophers, and politicians often use the word "evil" to describe the Nazi regime.', u'Many European countries have criminalised both the promotion of Nazism and Holocaust denial.', u'Historian Friedrich Meinecke described Hitler as "one of the great examples of the singular and incalculable power of personality in historical life".', u'English historian Hugh Trevor-Roper saw him as "among the \'terrible simplifiers\' of history, the most systematic, the most historical, the most philosophical, and yet the coarsest, cruelest, least magnanimous conqueror the world has ever known".', u"For the historian John M. Roberts, Hitler's defeat marked the end of a phase of European history dominated by Germany.", u'In its place emerged the Cold War, a global confrontation between the Western Bloc, dominated by the United States and other NATO nations, and the Eastern Bloc, dominated by the Soviet Union.', u'Historian Sebastian Haffner avers that without Hitler and the displacement of the Jews, the modern nation state of Israel would not exist.', u'He contends that without Hitler, the de-colonisation of former European spheres of influence would have been postponed.', u'Further, Haffner claims that other than Alexander the Great, Hitler had a more significant impact than any other comparable historical figure, in that he too caused a wide range of worldwide changes in a relatively short time span.', u'== Views on religion ==\n\nHitler was born to a practising Catholic mother and an anticlerical father; after leaving home Hitler never again attended Mass or received the sacraments.', u'Speer states that Hitler made harsh pronouncements against the church to his political associates and though he never officially left it, he had no attachment to it.', u'He adds that Hitler felt that in the absence of the church the faithful would turn to mysticism, which he considered a step backwards.', u'According to Speer, Hitler believed that either Japanese religious beliefs or Islam would have been a more suitable religion for the Germans than Christianity, with its "meekness and flabbiness".', u'Historian John S.

Pike's Peak was.", u"== Overview ==\n\nThe Pike's Peak Gold Rush, which followed the California Gold Rush by approximately one decade, produced a dramatic but temporary influx of immigrants into the Pike's Peak Country of the Southern Rocky Mountains.", u'The rush was exemplified by the slogan "Pike\'s Peak or Bust!', u'", a reference to the prominent mountain at the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains that guided many early prospectors to the region westward over the Great Plains.', u'The prospectors provided the first major European-American population in the region.', u'The rush created a few mining camps such as Denver City and Boulder City that would develop into cities.', u'Many smaller camps such as Auraria and Saint Charles City were absorbed by larger camps and towns.', u'Scores of other mining camps have faded into ghost towns, but quite a few camps such as Central City, Black Hawk, Georgetown, and Idaho Springs survive.', u'== Discovery ==\n\nFor many years people had suspected the mountains had numerous rich gold deposits.', u'In 1835, a French trapper by the name of Eustace Carriere had ended up losing his party and wandered through the mountains for many weeks.', u'During these weeks he found many gold specimens which he later took back to New Mexico for examination.', u'Upon examination, they turned out to be "pure gold".', u'But when he tried to lead an expedition back to the location of where he found the gold, they came up short because he could not quite remember the location.', u'In 1849 and 1850, several parties of gold seekers bound for the California Gold Rush panned small amounts of gold from various streams in the South Platte River valley at the foot of the Rocky Mountains.', u'The Rocky Mountain gold failed to impress or delay men with visions of unlimited wealth in California, and the discoveries were not reported for several years.', u'As the hysteria of the California Gold Rush faded, many discouraged gold seekers returned home.', u'Rumors of gold in the Rocky Mountains persisted and several small parties explored the region.', u'In the summer of 1857, a party of Spanish-speaking gold seekers from New Mexico worked a placer deposit along the South Platte River about 5 miles (8 kilometers) above Cherry Creek in what is today Denver.', u'William Greeneberry "Green" Russell was a Georgian who worked in the California gold fields in the 1850s.', u'Russell was married to a Cherokee woman, and through his connections to the tribe, he heard about an 1849 discovery of gold along the South Platte River.',

u'They began prospecting in the river beds, exploring Cherry Creek and nearby Ralston Creek but without success.', u'In the first week of July 1858, Green Russell and Sam Bates found a small placer deposit near the mouth of Little Dry Creek that yielded about 20 troy ounces (622 grams) of gold, the first significant gold discovery in the Rocky Mountain region.', u'The site of the discovery is in the present-day Denver suburb of Englewood, just north of the junction of U.S. Highway 285 and U.S. Highway 85.', u'== The initial boom ==\n\nThe first decade of the boom was largely concentrated along the South Platte River at the base of the mountains, the canyon of Clear Creek in the mountains west of Golden City, at Breckenridge and in South Park at Como, Fairplay, and Alma.', u'By 1860, Denver City, Golden City, and Boulder City were substantial towns serving the mines.', u'Rapid population growth led to the creation of the Colorado Territory in 1861.', u"The Pike's Peak Gold Rush

start, only to realize that they would have to wait until the snow melted to even begin their mining for gold.', u'=== Free gold ===\n\nHardrock mining boomed for a few years, but then declined in the mid-1860s as the miners exhausted the shallow parts of the veins that contained free gold, and found that their amalgamation mills could not recover gold from the deeper sulfide ores.', u'This problem

{'sentences': [u'A senate is a deliberative assembly, often the upper house or chamber of a bicameral legislature or parliament.', u'The name comes from the ancient Roman Senate (Latin: Senatus), so-called as an assembly of the senior (Latin: senex meaning "the elder" or "the old one") and therefore allegedly wiser and more experienced members of the society or ruling class.', u'Thus, the literal meaning of the word "senate" is: Assembly of Elders.', u'Many countries have an assembly named a senate, composed of senators who may be elected, appointed, have inherited the title, or gained membership by other methods, depending on the country.', u'Modern senates typically serve to provide a chamber of "sober second thought" to consider legislation passed by a lower house, whose members are usually elected.', u'== Overview ==\nThe modern word Senate is derived from the [Latin] word sen\u0101tus (senate), which comes from senex, \u201cold man\u201d.', u'The members or legislators of a senate are called senators.', u'The Latin word senator was adopted into English with no change in spelling.', u'Its meaning is derived from a very ancient form of social organization, in which advisory or decision-making powers are reserved for the eldest men.', u'For the same reason, the word senate is correctly used when referring to any powerful authority characteristically composed by the eldest members of a community, as a deliberative body of a faculty in an institution of higher learning is often called a senate.', u'This form adaptation was used to show the power of those in body and for the decision-making process to be thorough, which could take a long period of time.', u'The original senate was the Roman Senate, which lasted until 580 (various efforts to revive it were made in Medieval Rome).', u'In the Eastern Roman Empire, the Byzantine Senate continued until the Fourth Crusade, circa 1202\u20131204.', u'Modern democratic states with bicameral parliamentary systems are sometimes equipped with a senate, often distinguished from an ordinary parallel lower house, known variously as the \u201cHouse of Representatives\u201d, \u201cHouse of Commons\u201d, \u201cChamber of Deputies\u201d, \u201cNational Assembly\u201d, \u201cLegislative Assembly\u201d, or "House of Assembly", by electoral rules.', u'This may include minimum age required for voters and candidates, proportional or majoritarian or plurality system, and an electoral basis or collegium.', u'Typically, the senate is referred to as the upper house and has a smaller membership than the lower house.', u'In some federal states senates also exist at the subnational level.', u'In the United States all states with the exception of Nebraska (whose legislature is a unicameral body called the \u201cLegislature\u201d but whose members refer to themselves as \u201csenators\u201d) have a state senate.', u'There is also the US Senate at the federal level.', u"Similarly in Argentina, in addition to the Senate at federal level, eight of the country's provinces, Buenos Aires, Catamarca, Corrientes, Entre R\xedos, Mendoza, Salta, San Luis (since 1987) and Santa Fe, have bicameral legislatures with a Senate.", u'C\xf3rdoba and Tucum\xe1n changed to unicameral systems in 2001 and 2003 respectively.', u'In Australia and Canada, only the upper house of the federal parliament is known as the Senate.', u'All states other than Queensland have an upper house known as a Legislative council.', u"Several Canadian provinces also once had a Legislative Council, but these have all been abolished, the last being Quebec's Legislative council in 1968.", u'In Germany, the last Senate of a State parliament, the Senate of Bavaria, was abolished in 1999.', u'Senate membership can be determined either through elections or appointments.', u'For example, elections are held every three years for half the membership of the Australian Senate, the term of a senator being six years.', u'In contrast, members of the Canadian Senate are appointed by the Governor General upon the recommendation of the Prime Minister of Canada, holding the office until they resign, are removed, or retire at the mandatory age of 75.', u'== Alternative meanings ==\nThe terms Senate and Senator, however, do not necessarily refer to a second chamber of a legislature:\nThe Senate of Finland was, until 1919, the executive branch and the supreme court.', u'The Senate of Latvia (lv) fulfilled a similar judicial function during the interbellum (1918-1940).', u'In German politics:\nIn the Bundesl\xe4nder (Federated States) of Germany which form a City State (in German: Stadtstaat), i.e.', u'Berlin (Senate of Berlin), Bremen (Senate of Bremen) and Hamburg (Senate of Hamburg), the Senates (Senat in German) are the executive branch, with Senator (Senator) being the holders of ministerial portfolios.', u'In a number of cities which were former members of the Hanse (a medieval confederacy of port cities mainly at the shores of the Baltic Sea and the North Sea), such as Greifswald, L\xfcbeck, Rostock, Stralsund, or Wismar, the city government is also called a Senate.', u'However, in Bavaria, the Senate was a second legislative chamber until its abolition in 1999.', u'In German jurisdiction:\nThe term Senat (senate) in higher courts of appeal refers to the "bench" in its broader metonymy meaning, describing members of the judiciary collectively (usually five judges), often occupied with a particular subject-matter jurisdiction.', u'However, the judges are not called "senators".', u'The German term Strafsenat (literally "Penal Senate") in a German court translates to Bench of penal-law jurisdiction and Zivilsenat (literally "Civil Senate") to Bench of private-law jurisdiction.', u'The Federal Constitutional Court of Germany consists of two senates of eight judges each.', u'In its case the division is mostly of an organizational nature, as a matter of dividing the work load; both senates handle the same kind of constitutional cases.', u'At some points in the past, one senate was considered more conservative and the other more liberal, but that is not the case as of 2011.', u'In Scotland, judges of the High Court of Justiciary are called Senators of the College of Justice.', u'In some, mostly federal countries with a unicameral legislature, some of the legislators are elected differently from the others and are called Senators.', u'In federal countries, such Senators represent the territories, while the other members represent the people at large (this device is used to allow a federal representation without having to establish a bicameral legislature); this is the case with St. Kitts and Nevis, Comoros and Micronesia.', u"In other, non-federal countries, the use of the term Senator marks some other difference between such members and the rest of the legislators (such as the method of selection); this is the case with the States of Jersey, Dominica's House of Assembly and the Saint Vincent House of Assembly.", u"In Wales, the National Assembly for Wales debating chamber is called the Senedd, pronounced 'Seneth'.", u'An academic senate is the governing body of some universities.', u'In Greece during the early stages of the Greek War of Independence, various local legislative and executive bodies were established by

Ferguson (1896) doctrine of separate but equal in interstate bus travel.', u'The ICC failed to enforce its ruling, and Jim Crow travel laws remained in force throughout the South.', u'The Freedom Riders challenged this status quo by riding interstate buses in the South in mixed racial groups to challenge local laws or customs that enforced segregation in seating.', u'The Freedom Rides, and the violent reactions they provoked, bolstered the credibility of the American Civil Rights Movement.', u'They called national attention to the disregard for the federal law and the local violence used to enforce segregation in the southern United States.', u'Police arrested riders for trespassing, unlawful assembly, and violating state and local Jim Crow laws, along with other alleged offenses, but they often first let white mobs attack them without intervention.', u'The Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) sponsored most of the subsequent Freedom Rides, but some were also organized by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).', u'The Freedom Rides followed dramatic sit-ins against segregated lunch counters, conducted by students and youth throughout the South, and boycotts of retail establishments that maintained segregated facilities, beginning in 1960.', u"The Supreme Court's decision in Boynton supported the right of interstate travelers to disregard local segregation ordinances.", u'Southern local and state police considered the actions of the Freedom Riders as criminal and arrested them in some locations.', u'In some localities, such as Birmingham, Alabama, the police cooperated with Ku Klux Klan chapters and other whites opposing the actions and allowed mobs to attack the riders.', u'== History ==\n\n\n=== Starting point ===\nThe Freedom Riders were inspired by the 1947 Journey of Reconciliation, led by Bayard Rustin and George Houser and co-sponsored by the Fellowship of Reconciliation and the then-fledgling Congress of Racial Equality (CORE).', u'Like the Freedom Rides of 1961, the Journey of Reconciliation was intended to test an earlier Supreme Court ruling that banned racial discrimination in interstate travel.', u'Rustin, Igal Roodenko, Joe Felmet and Andrew Johnnson, were arrested and sentenced to serve on a chain gang in North Carolina for violating local Jim Crow laws regarding segregated seating on public transportation.', u'The first Freedom Ride began on May 4, 1961.', u'Led by CORE Director James Farmer, 13 riders (seven black, six white, including Genevieve Hughes, William E. Harbour, and Ed Blankenheim) left Washington, DC, on Greyhound and Trailways buses.', u'Their plan was to ride through Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, ending in New Orleans, Louisiana, where a civil rights rally was planned.', u'Most of the Riders were from CORE, and two were from SNCC.', u'Many were in their 40s and 50s.', u'Some were as young as 18.', u"The Freedom Riders' tactics for their journey were to have at least one interracial pair sitting in adjoining seats, and at least one black rider sitting up front, where seats under segregation had been reserved for white customers by local custom throughout the South.", u'The rest of the team would sit scattered throughout the rest of the bus.', u"One rider would abide by the South's segregation rules in order to avoid arrest and to contact CORE and arrange bail for those who were arrested.", u'Only minor trouble was encountered in Virginia and North Carolina, but John Lewis was attacked in Rock Hill, South Carolina.', u'Some of the Riders were arrested in Charlotte, North Carolina; Winnsboro, South Carolina; and Jackson, Mississippi.', u'=== Mob violence in Anniston and Birmingham ===\nThe Birmingham, Alabama, Police Commissioner, Bull Connor, together with Police Sergeant Tom Cook (an avid Ku Klux Klan supporter), organized violence against the Freedom Riders with local Ku Klux Klan chapters.', u'The pair made plans to bring the Ride to an end in Alabama.', u'They assured Gary Thomas Rowe, an FBI informer and member of Eastview Klavern #13 (the most violent Klan group in Alabama), that the mob would have fifteen minutes to attack the Freedom Riders without any arrests being made.', u'The plan was to allow an initial assault in Anniston with a final assault taking place in Birmingham.', u"On May 14, Mother's Day, in Anniston, a mob of Ku Klux Klansmen, some still in church attire, attacked the first of the two buses (the Greyhound).", u'The driver tried to leave the station, but was blocked until KKK members slashed its tires.', u'The mob forced the crippled bus to stop several miles outside of town and then firebombed it.', u'As the bus burned, the mob held the doors shut, intending to burn the riders to death.', u'Sources disagree, but either an exploding fuel tank or an undercover state investigator brandishing a revolver caused the mob to retreat, and the riders escaped the bus.', u'The mob beat the riders after they escaped the bus.', u'Only warning shots fired into the air by highway patrolmen prevented the riders from being lynched.', u'That night, the hospitalized Freedom Riders, most of whom had been refused care, were removed from the hospital at 2 AM, because the staff feared the mob outside the hospital.', u'The local civil rights leader Rev.', u'Fred Shuttlesworth organized several cars of blacks to rescue the injured Freedom Riders in defiance of the white supremacists.', u'The blacks were under the leadership of Colonel Stone Johnson and were openly armed as they arrived at the hospital, protecting the Freedom Riders from the mob.', u'When the Trailways bus reached Anniston and pulled in at the terminal an hour after the Greyhound bus was burned, it was boarded by eight Klansmen.', u'They beat the Freedom Riders and left them semi-conscious in the back of the bus.', u'When the bus arrived in Birmingham, it was attacked by a mob of KKK members aided and abetted by police under the orders of Commissioner Bull Connor.', u'As the riders exited the bus, they were beaten by the mob with baseball bats, iron pipes and bicycle chains.', u'Among the attacking Klansmen was Gary Thomas Rowe, an FBI informant.', u'White Freedom Riders were singled out for especially frenzied beatings; James Peck required more than 50 stitches to the wounds in his head.', u'Peck was taken to Carraway Methodist Medical Center, which refused to treat him; he was later treated at Jefferson Hillman Hospital.', u'When reports of the bus burning and beatings reached US Attorney General Robert Kennedy, he urged restraint on the part of Freedom Riders.', u'He sent an assistant, John Seigenthaler, to Alabama to try to calm the situation.', u'Despite the violence suffered and the threat of more to come, the Freedom Riders wanted to continue their journey.', u'Kennedy had arranged an escort for the Riders in order to get them to Montgomery, Alabama, safely.', u'However, radio reports told of the mob awaiting the riders at the bus terminal, as well as on the route to Montgomery.', u'The Greyhound clerks told the Riders that their drivers were refusing to drive any Freedom Riders anywhere.', u'Recognizing that their efforts had already called national attention to the civil rights cause and wanting to make the rally in New Orleans, the Riders decided to abandon the rest of the bus ride and fly directly to New Orleans from Birmingham.', u'When they first boarded the plane, all passengers had to exit because of a bomb threat.', u'Diane Nash, a Nashville college student and SNCC leader, believed that if Southern violence were allowed to halt the Freedom Rides, the movement would be set back years.', u'She pushed to find replacements to resume the rides.', u'On May 17, a new set of riders, 10 students from Nashville, took a bus to Birmingham, where they were arrested by Bull Connor and jailed.', u'These students kept their spirits up in jail by singing freedom songs.', u'Out of frustration, Connor drove them back up to the Tennessee line and dropped them off, saying, "I just couldn\'t stand their singing."', u'They immediately returned to Birmingham.', u"=== Mob violence in Montgomery ===\nIn answer to SNCC's call, Freedom Riders from across the Eastern US joined John Lewis and Hank Thomas, the two young SNCC members of the original Ride, who had remained in Birmingham.", u'On May 19, they attempted to resume the ride, but, terrified by the howling mob surrounding the bus depot, the drivers refused.', u'Harassed and besieged by the mob, the riders waited all night for a bus.', u'Under intense public pressure from the Kennedy administration, Greyhound was forced to provide a driver.', u"After direct intervention by Byron White of the Attorney General's office, Alabama Governor John Patterson reluctantly promised to protect the bus from KKK mobs and snipers on the road between Birmingham and Montgomery.", u'On the morning of May 20, the Freedom Ride resumed, with the bus carrying the riders traveling toward Montgomery at 90 miles an hour, protected by a contingent of the Alabama State Highway Patrol.', u'The Highway Patrol abandoned the bus and riders at the Montgomery city limits.', u'At the bus station on South Court Street, a white mob awaited.', u'They beat the Freedom Riders with baseball bats and iron pipes.', u'The local police allowed the beatings to go on uninterrupted.', u'Again, white Freedom Riders were singled out for particularly brutal beatings.', u'Reporters and news photographers were attacked first and their cameras destroyed, but one reporter took a photo later of Jim Zwerg in the hospital, showing how he was beaten and bruised.', u'Seigenthaler, a Justice Department official, was beaten and left unconscious lying in the street.', u'Ambulances refused to take the wounded to the hospital.', u'Local blacks rescued them, and a number of the Freedom Riders were hospitalized.', u"On the following night, Sunday, May 21, more than 1500 people packed Reverend Ralph Abernathy's First Baptist Church to honor the Freedom Riders.", u'Among the speakers were Rev.', u'Martin Luther King, Jr., who was newly based in Montgomery, Rev.', u'Fred Shuttlesworth, and James Farmer.', u'Outside, a mob of more than 3,000 whites attacked blacks, with a handful of the United States Marshals Service protecting the church from assault and fire bombs.', u'With city and state police making no effort to restore order, the civil rights leaders appealed to the President for protection.', u'President Kennedy threatened the governor to intervene with federal troops if he would not protect the people.', u'Governor Patterson forestalled that by finally ordering the Alabama National Guard to disperse the mob, and the Guard reached the church in the early morning.', u'In a commemorative Op-Ed piece in 2011, Bernard Lafayette remembered the mob breaking windows of the church with rocks and setting off tear gas canisters.', u'He recounted heroic action by King.', u'After learning that black taxi drivers were arming and forming a group to rescue the people inside, he worried that more violence would result.', u'He selected ten volunteers, who promised non-violence, to escort him through the white mob, which parted to let King and his escorts pass as they marched two by two.', u'King went out to the black drivers and asked them to disperse, to prevent more violence.', u'King and his escorts formally made their way back inside the church, unmolested.', u'Lafayette also was interviewed by BBC in 2011 and told about these events in an episode broadcast on radio 31 August 2011 in commemoration of the Freedom Rides.', u'The Alabama National Guard finally arrived in the early morning to disperse the mob and safely escorted all the people from the church.', u'=== Into Mississippi ===\n\nThe next day, Monday, May 22, more Freedom Riders from Congress of Racial Equality and Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee arrived in Montgomery to continue the rides through the South and replace the wounded riders still in the hospital.', u'Behind the scenes, the Kennedy administration arranged a deal with the governors of Alabama and Mississippi.', u'The governors agreed that state police and the National Guard would protect the Riders from mob violence.', u'In return, the federal government would not intervene to stop local police from arresting Freedom Riders for violating segregation ordinances when the buses arrived at the depots.', u'On Wednesday morning, May 24, Freedom Riders boarded buses for the journey to Jackson, Mississippi.', u'Surrounded by Highway Patrol and the National Guard, the buses arrived in Jackson without incident.', u'The riders were immediately arrested when they tried to use the white-only facilities at the depot.', u'In Montgomery, the next round of Freedom Riders, including the Yale University chaplain William Sloane Coffin, Gaylord Brewster Noyce, and southern ministers Shuttlesworth, Abernathy, Wyatt Tee Walker, and others were similarly arrested for violating local segregation ordinances.', u'This established a pattern followed by subsequent Freedom Rides, most of which traveled to Jackson, where they were arrested and jailed.', u"The Riders' strategy became one of trying to fill the jails.", u'Once the Jackson and Hinds County jails were filled to overflowing, the state transferred the Freedom Riders to the infamous Mississippi State Penitentiary (known as Parchman Farm).', u'Abusive treatment there included placement of Riders in the Maximum Security Unit (Death Row), issuance of only underwear, no exercise, and no mail.', u'When the Freedom Riders refused to stop singing freedom songs, prison officials took away their mattresses, sheets, and toothbrushes.', u'More Freedom Riders arrived from across the country, and at one time, more than 300 were held in Parchman Farm.', u'=== Kennedy urges "cooling off period" ===\nThe Kennedys called for a "cooling off period" and condemned the Rides as unpatriotic because they embarrassed the nation on the world stage at the height of the Cold War.', u'The Soviet Union criticized the United States for its racism and the attacks on the riders.', u'Attorney General Robert Kennedy, the chief law-enforcement officer of the land, was quoted as saying that he "does not feel that the Department of Justice can side with one group or the other in disputes over Constitutional rights."', u'His comment angered civil rights supporters, who considered the Justice Department duty-bound to enforce Supreme Court rulings and defend citizens exercising their Constitutional rights from mob violence.', u'Nonetheless, international outrage about the widely covered events and racial violence created pressure on United States political leaders.', u'On May 29, 1961, Attorney General Kennedy sent a petition to the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) asking it to comply with the bus-desegregation ruling it had issued in November 1955, in Sarah Keys v. Carolina Coach Company.', u'That ruling had explicitly repudiated separate but equal in the realm of interstate bus travel.', u'Chaired by the South Carolina Democrat J. Monroe Johnson, the ICC had failed to implement its own ruling.', u'James Farmer, head of CORE, responded to Kennedy saying, "We have been cooling off for 350 years, and if we cooled off any more, we\'d be in a deep freeze."', u'=== Summer escalation ===\n\nCORE, SNCC, and the SCLC rejected any "cooling off period".', u'They formed a Freedom Riders Coordinating Committee to keep the Rides rolling through June, July, August, and September.', u'During those months, more than 60 different Freedom Rides criss-crossed the South, most of them converging on Jackson, where every rider was arrested, more than 300 in total.', u'An unknown number of riders were arrested in other Southern towns.', u'It is estimated that almost 450 riders participated in one or more Freedom Rides.', u'About 75% were male, and the same percentage were under the age of 30, with about equal participation from blacks and whites.', u'During the summer of 1961, Freedom Riders also campaigned against other forms of racial discrimination.', u'They sat together in segregated restaurants, lunch counters and hotels.', u'This was especially effective when they targeted large companies, such as hotel chains.', u'Fearing boycotts in the North, the hotels began to desegregate their businesses.', u'In mid-June, a group of Freedom Riders had scheduled to end their ride in Tallahassee, Florida, with plans to fly home from the Tallahassee airport.', u"They were provided a police escort to the airport from the city's bus facilities.", u'At the airport, they decided to eat at a restaurant that was marked "For Whites Only".', u'The owners decided to close rather than serve the mixed group of Freedom Riders.', u'Although the restaurant was privately owned, it was leased from the county government.', u'Canceling their plane reservations, the Riders decided to wait until the restaurant re-opened so they could be served.', u'They waited until 11:00 pm that night and returned the following day.', u'During this time, hostile crowds gathered, threatening violence.', u'On June 16, 1961, the Freedom Riders were arrested in Tallahassee for unlawful assembly.', u'That arrest and subsequent trial became known as Dresner v. City of Tallahassee.', u'Convictions of the Riders were appealed to the US Supreme Court in 1963, which refused to hear the case based on technical reasons.', u'=== Monroe and Robert F. Williams ===\nIn early August, SNCC staff members James Forman and Paul Brooks, with the support of Ella Baker, began planning a Freedom Ride in solidarity with Robert F. Williams.', u'Williams was an extremely militant and controversial NAACP chapter president for Monroe, North Carolina.', u'After making the public statement that he would "meet violence with violence," (since the federal government would not protect his community from racial attacks) he had been suspended by the NAACP national board over the objections of Williams\' local membership.', u'Williams continued his work against segregation however, and was facing repeated attempts on his life because of it.', u"Some SNCC staff members sympathized with the local community's proclivity for armed self-defense, although many on the ride to Monroe saw this as an opportunity to prove the superiority of Gandhian nonviolence over the use of force.", u'The Freedom Riders in Monroe were brutally attacked by white supremacists with the approval of local police.', u"On August 27, James Forman - SNCC's Executive Secretary - was struck unconscious with the butt of a rifle and taken to jail with numerous other demonstrators.", u'Police and civilian white supremacists roamed the town shooting at blacks, who returned the gunfire.', u'Robert F. Williams fortified the black neighborhood against attack and in the process briefly detained a white couple who had gotten lost there.', u'The police accused Williams of kidnapping and called in the state milita and FBI to arrest him, in spite of the couple being quickly released.', u'Certain he would be lynched, Williams fled and eventually found refuge in Cuba.', u'Movement lawyers, eager to disengage from the situation, successfully urged the Freedom Riders not to practice the normal "jail-no bail" strategy in Monroe.', u'Local officials, also apparently eager to de-escalate, found demonstrators guilty but immediately suspended their sentences.', u'One Freedom Rider however, John Lowry, went on trial for the kidnapping case, along with several associates of Robert F. Williams, including Mae Mallory.', u'Monroe legal defense committees were popular around the country, but ultimately Lowry and Mallory served prison sentences.', u'In 1965, their convictions were vacated due to the exclusion of blacks from the jury selection.', u'=== Resolution and legacy ===\nBy September it had been over three months since the filing of the petition by Robert Kennedy.', u'CORE and SNCC leaders made tentative plans for a mass demonstration known as the "Washington Project".', u'This would mobilize hundreds, perhaps thousands, of nonviolent demonstrators to the capital city to apply pressure on the ICC and the Kennedy administration.', u'The idea was pre-empted when the ICC finally issued the necessary orders just before the end of the month.', u'The new policies went into effect on November 1, 1961, six years after the ruling in Sarah Keys v. Carolina Coach Company.', u'After the new ICC rule took effect, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they pleased on interstate buses and trains; "white" and "colored" signs were removed from the terminals; racially segregated drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms serving interstate customers were consolidated; and the lunch counters began serving all customers, regardless of race.', u'The widespread violence provoked by the Freedom Rides sent shock waves through American society.', u'People worried that the Rides were evoking widespread social disorder and racial divergence, an opinion supported and strengthened in many communities by the press.', u'The press in white communities condemned the direct action approach that CORE was taking, while some of the national press negatively portrayed the Riders as provoking unrest.', u'At the same time, the Freedom Rides established great credibility with blacks and whites throughout the United States and inspired many people to engage in direct action for civil rights.', u'Perhaps most significantly, the actions of the Freedom Riders from the North, who faced danger on behalf of southern blacks, impressed and inspired the many blacks living in rural areas throughout the South.', u'They formed the backbone of the wider civil rights movement, who engaged in voter registration and other activities.', u'Southern blacks generally organized around their churches, the center of their communities and a base of moral strength.', u'The Freedom Riders helped inspire participation in other subsequent civil rights campaigns, including voter registration throughout the South, freedom schools, and the Black Power movement.', u'At the time, most blacks in southern states had been unable to register to vote, due to constitutions, laws and practices that had effectively disfranchised most of them since the turn of the 20th century.', u'For instance, white administrators supervised reading comprehension and literacy tests that highly educated blacks could not pass.', u'== List of Freedom Rides ==\n\n\n=== Precursors to Freedom Rides ===\n\n\n=== Original and subsequent Freedom Rides ===\n\n\n=== Mississippi Freedom Rides ===\n\n\n== Commemorations ==\n\nIn celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Freedom Rides, Oprah Winfrey invited all living Freedom Riders to join her TV program to celebrate their legacy.', u'The episode aired on May 4, 2011.', u'On May 6\u201316, 2011, 40 college students from across the United States embarked on a bus ride from Washington, D.C. to New Orleans, retracing the original route of the Freedom Riders.', u'The 2011 Student Freedom Ride, which was sponsored by PBS and American Experience, commemorated the 50th anniversary of the original Freedom Rides.', u'Students met with civil rights leaders along the way and traveled with original Freedom Riders such as Ernest "Rip" Patton, Joan Mulholland, Bob Singleton, Helen Singleton, Jim Zwerg, and Charles Person.', u'On May 16, 2011, PBS aired a documentary called Freedom Riders.', u'On May 19\u201321, 2011, the Freedom Rides were commemorated in Montgomery, Alabama, at the new Freedom Ride museum in the old Greyhound Bus terminal, where some of the violence had taken place in 1961.', u'On May 22\u201326, 2011, the arrival of the Freedom Rides in Jackson, Mississippi was commemorated with a 50th Anniversary Reunion and Conference in the city.', u'During commemorative events in February 2013 in Montgomery, Congressman John Lewis accepted the apologies of Chief Kevin Murphy of the Montgomery Police Department; Murphy gave Lewis his own badge, off his uniform, moving Lewis to tears.', u'In late 2011, Palestinian activists, inspired by the freedom riders, used the same methods in Israel by boarding a bus from which they were excluded.', u'Dan Shore\'s 2013 opera "Freedom Ride," set in New Orleans, celebrates the Freedom Riders.', u'== Notable Freedom Riders ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n"He Was My Brother", a Simon & Garfunkel song about the Freedom Riders\nReverse freedom rides\nFreedom Ride (Australia)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Scholarly works ===\nArsenault, Raymond (2006).', u'Freedom Riders: 1961 and the Struggle for Racial Justice.', u'Oxford University Press.', u'ISBN 9780199755813.', u'Barnes, Catherine A.', u'(1983).', u'Journey from Jim Crow: The Desegregation of Southern Transit.', u'Columbia University Press.', u'ISBN 9780231053808.', u'Branch, Taylor (2007).', u'Parting the Waters: America in the King Years 1954-63.', u'Simon and Schuster.', u'ISBN 9781416558682.', u'Catsam, Derek (2009).', u"Freedom's Main Line: The Journey of Reconciliation and the Freedom Rides.", u'University Press of Kentucky.', u'ISBN 9780813173108.', u'Etheridge, Eric;

originates from the Latin patere, which means "to lay open" (i.e., to make available for public inspection).', u'More directly, it is a shortened version of the term letters patent, which was a royal decree granting exclusive rights to a person, predating the modern patent system.', u'Similar grants included land patents, which were land grants by early state governments in the USA, and printing patents, a precursor of modern copyright.', u'In modern usage, the term patent usually refers to the right granted to anyone who invents any new, useful, and non-obvious process, machine, article of manufacture, or composition of matter.', u"Some other types of intellectual property rights are also called patents in some jurisdictions: industrial design rights are called design patents in the US, plant breeders' rights are sometimes called plant patents, and utility models and Gebrauchsmuster are sometimes called petty patents or innovation patents.", u'The additional qualification utility patent is sometimes used (primarily in the US) to distinguish the primary meaning from these other types of patents.', u'Particular species of patents for inventions include biological patents, business method patents, chemical patents and software patents.', u'== History ==\n\nAlthough there is some evidence that some form of patent rights was recognized in Ancient Greece in the Greek city of Sybaris, the first statutory patent system is generally regarded to be the Venetian Patent Statute of 1450.', u'Patents were systematically granted in Venice as of 1450, where they issued a decree by which new and inventive devices had to be communicated to the Republic in order to obtain legal protection against potential infringers.', u'The period of protection was 10 years.', u'These were mostly in the field of glass making.', u'As Venetians emigrated, they sought similar patent protection in their new homes.', u'This led to the diffusion of patent systems to other countries.', u'The English patent system evolved from its early medieval origins into the first modern patent system that recognised intellectual property in order to stimulate invention; this was the crucial legal foundation upon which the Industrial Revolution could emerge and flourish.', u'By the 16th century, the English Crown would habitually abuse the granting of letters patent for monopolies.', u'After public outcry, King James I of England (VI of Scotland) was forced to revoke all existing monopolies and declare that they were only to be used for "projects of new invention".', u"This was incorporated into the Statute of Monopolies (1624) in which Parliament restricted the Crown's power explicitly so that the King could only issue letters patent to the inventors or introducers of original inventions for a fixed number of years.", u'The Statute became the foundation for later developments in patent law in England and elsewhere.', u'Important developments in patent law emerged during the 18th century through a slow process of judicial interpretation of the law.', u'During the reign of Queen Anne, patent applications were required to supply a complete specification of the principles of operation of the invention for public access.', u'Legal battles around the 1796 patent taken out by James Watt for his steam engine, established the principles that patents could be issued for improvements of an already existing machine and that ideas or principles without specific practical application could also legally be patented.', u'Influenced by the philosophy of John Locke, the granting of patents began to be viewed as a form of intellectual property right, rather than simply the obtaining of economic privilege.', u'The English legal system became the foundation for patent law in countries with a common law heritage, including the United States, New Zealand and Australia.', u"In the Thirteen Colonies, inventors could obtain patents through petition to a given colony's legislature.", u'In 1641, Samuel Winslow was granted the first patent in North America by the Massachusetts General Court for a new process for making salt.', u'The modern French patent system was created during the Revolution in 1791.', u"Patents were granted without examination since inventor's right was considered as a natural one.", u'Patent costs were very high (from 500 to 1,500 francs).', u'Importation patents protected new devices coming from foreign countries.', u'The patent law was revised in 1844 - patent cost was lowered and importation patents were abolished.', u'The first Patent Act of the U.S. Congress was passed on April 10, 1790, titled "An Act to promote the progress of useful Arts".', u'The first patent was granted on July 31, 1790 to Samuel Hopkins for a method of producing potash (potassium carbonate).', u'== Law ==\n\n\n=== Effects ===\nA patent does not give a right to make or use or sell an invention.', u'Rather, a patent provides, from a legal standpoint, the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the patented invention for the term of the patent, which is usually 20 years from the filing date subject to the payment of maintenance fees.', u'From an economic and practical standpoint however, a patent is better and perhaps more precisely regarded as conferring upon its proprietor "a right to try to exclude by asserting the patent in court", for many granted patents turn out to be invalid once their proprietors attempt to assert them in court.', u'A patent is a limited property right the government gives inventors in exchange for their agreement to share details of their inventions with the public.', u'Like any other property right, it may be sold, licensed, mortgaged, assigned or transferred, given away, or simply abandoned.', u'A patent, being an exclusionary right, does not necessarily give the patent owner the right to exploit the invention subject to the patent.', u"For example, many inventions are improvements of prior inventions that may still be covered by someone else's patent.", u'If an inventor obtains a patent on improvements to an existing invention which is still under patent, they can only legally use the improved invention if the patent holder of the original invention gives permission, which they may refuse.', u'Some countries have "working provisions" that require the invention be exploited in the jurisdiction it covers.', u'Consequences of not working an invention vary from one country to another, ranging from revocation of the patent rights to the awarding of a compulsory license awarded by the courts to a party wishing to exploit a patented invention.', u'The patentee has the opportunity to challenge the revocation or license, but is usually required to provide evidence that the reasonable requirements of the public have been met by the working of invention.', u'=== Challenges ===\n In most jurisdictions, there are ways for third parties to challenge the validity of an allowed or issued patent at the national patent office; these are called opposition proceedings.', u'It is also possible to challenge the validity of a patent in court.', u'In either case, the challenging party tries to prove that the patent should never have been granted.', u'There are several grounds for challenges: the claimed subject matter is not patentable subject matter at all; the claimed subject matter was actually not new, or was obvious to experts in the field, at the time the application was filed; or that the some kind of fraud was committed during prosecution with regard to listing of inventors, representations about when discoveries were made, etc.', u'Patents can be found to be invalid in whole or in part for any of these reasons.', u'=== Infringement ===\n\nPatent infringement occurs when a third party, without authorization from the patentee, makes, uses, or sells a patented invention.', u'Patents, however, are enforced on a nation by nation basis.', u'The making of an item in China, for example, that would infringe a U.S. patent, would not constitute infringement under US patent law unless the item were imported into the US.', u'=== Enforcement ===\nPatents can generally only be enforced through civil lawsuits (for example, for a U.S. patent, by an action for patent infringement in a United States federal court), although some countries (such as France and Austria) have criminal penalties for wanton infringement.', u'Typically, the patent owner seeks monetary compensation for past infringement, and seeks an injunction that prohibits the defendant from engaging in future acts of infringement.', u'To prove infringement, the patent owner must establish that the accused infringer practises all the requirements of at least one of the claims of the patent.', u'(In many jurisdictions the scope of the patent may not be limited to what is literally stated in the claims, for example due to the doctrine of equivalents).', u'An accused infringer has the right to challenge the validity of the patent allegedly being infringed in a countersuit.', u'A patent can be found invalid on grounds described in the relevant patent laws, which vary between countries.', u'Often, the grounds are a subset of requirements for patentability in the relevant country.', u'Although an infringer is generally free to rely on any available ground of invalidity (such as a prior publication, for example), some countries have sanctions to prevent the same validity questions being relitigated.', u'An example is the UK Certificate of contested validity.', u'Patent licensing agreements are contracts in which the patent owner (the licensor) agrees to grant the licensee the right to make, use, sell, and/or import the claimed invention, usually in return for a royalty or other compensation.', u'It is common for companies engaged in complex technical fields to enter into multiple license agreements associated with the production of a single product.', u"Moreover, it is equally common for competitors in such fields to license patents to each other under cross-licensing agreements in order to share the benefits of using each other's patented inventions.", u'=== Ownership ===\nIn most countries, both natural persons and corporate entities may apply for a patent.', u'In the United States, however, only the inventor(s) may apply for a patent although it may be assigned to a corporate entity subsequently and inventors may be required to assign inventions to their employers under an employment contract.', u"In most European countries, ownership of an invention may pass from the inventor to their employer by rule of law if the invention was made in the course of the inventor's normal or specifically assigned employment duties, where an invention might reasonably be expected to result from carrying out those duties, or if the inventor had a special obligation to further the interests of the employer's company.", u'The inventors, their successors or their assignees become the proprietors of the patent when and if it is granted.', u'If a patent is granted to more than one proprietor, the laws of the country in question and any agreement between the proprietors may affect the extent to which each proprietor can exploit the patent.', u'For example, in some countries, each proprietor may freely license or assign their rights in the patent to another person while the law in other countries prohibits such actions without the permission of the other proprietor(s).', u'The ability to assign ownership rights increases the liquidity of a patent as property.', u'Inventors can obtain patents and then sell them to third parties.', u'The third parties then own the patents and have the same rights to prevent others from exploiting the claimed inventions, as if they had originally made the inventions themselves.', u'=== Governing laws ===\n\nThe grant and enforcement of patents are governed by national laws, and also by international treaties, where those treaties have been given effect in national laws.', u'Patents are granted by national or regional patent offices.', u'A given patent is therefore only useful for protecting an invention in the country in which that patent is granted.', u'In other words, patent law is territorial in nature.', u'When a patent application is published, the invention disclosed in the application becomes prior art and enters the public domain (if not protected by other patents) in countries where a patent applicant does not seek protection, the application thus generally becoming prior art against anyone (including the applicant) who might seek patent protection for the invention in those countries.', u"Commonly, a nation forms a patent office with responsibility for operating that nation's patent system, within the relevant patent laws.", u'The patent office generally has responsibility for the grant of patents, with infringement being the remit of national courts.', u'The authority for patent statutes in different countries varies.', u'In the UK, substantive patent law is contained in the Patents Act 1977 as amended.', u'In the United States, the Constitution empowers Congress to make laws to "promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts..." The laws Congress passed are codified in Title 35 of the United States Code and created the United States Patent and Trademark Office.', u'There is a trend towards global harmonization of patent laws, with the World Trade Organization (WTO) being particularly active in this area.', u'The TRIPs Agreement has been largely successful in providing a forum for nations to agree on an aligned set of patent laws.', u'Conformity with the TRIPs agreement is a requirement of admission to the WTO and so compliance is seen by many nations as important.', u'This has also led to many developing nations, which may historically have developed different laws to aid their development, enforcing patents laws in line with global practice.', u'In addition, there are international treaty procedures, such as the procedures under the European Patent Convention (EPC) [constituting the European Patent Organisation (EPOrg)], that centralize some portion of the filing and examination procedure.', u'Similar arrangements exist among the member states of ARIPO and OAPI, the analogous treaties among African countries, and the nine CIS member states that have formed the Eurasian Patent Organization.', u'A key international convention relating to patents is the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, initially signed in 1883.', u'The Paris Convention sets out a range of basic rules relating to patents, and although the convention does not have direct legal effect in all national jurisdictions, the principles of the convention are incorporated into all notable current patent systems.', u'The most significant aspect of the convention is the provision of the right to claim priority: filing an application in any one member state of the Paris Convention preserves the right for one year to file in any other member state, and receive the benefit of the original filing date.', u'Another key treaty is the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), administered by WIPO and covering more than 140 countries.', u'The Patent Cooperation Treaty provides a unified procedure for filing patent applications to protect inventions in each of its contracting states.', u'A patent application filed under the PCT is called an international application, or PCT application.', u'=== Application and prosecution ===\n\nA patent is requested by filing a written application at the relevant patent office.', u'The person or company filing the application is referred to as "the applicant".', u'The applicant may be the inventor or its assignee.', u'The application contains a description of how to make and use the invention that must provide sufficient detail for a person skilled in the art (i.e., the relevant area of technology) to make and use the invention.', u'In some countries there are requirements for providing specific information such as the usefulness of the invention, the best mode of performing the invention known to the inventor, or the technical problem or problems solved by the invention.', u'Drawings illustrating the invention may also be provided.', u'The application also includes one or more claims that define what a patent covers or the "scope of protection".', u'After filing, an application is often referred to as "patent pending".', u'While this term does not confer legal protection, and a patent cannot be enforced until granted, it serves to provide warning to potential infringers that if the patent is issued, they may be liable for damages.', u'Once filed, a patent application is "prosecuted".', u'A patent examiner reviews the patent application to determine if it meets the patentability requirements of that country.', u'If the application does not comply, objections are communicated to the applicant or their patent agent or attorney through an Office action, to which the applicant may respond.', u'The number of Office actions and responses that may occur vary from country to country, but eventually a final rejection is sent by the patent office, or the patent application is granted, which after the payment of additional fees, leads to an issued, enforceable patent.', u'In some jurisdictions, there are opportunities for third parties to bring an opposition proceeding between grant and issuance, or post-issuance.', u'Once granted the patent is subject in most countries to renewal fees to keep the patent in force.', u'These fees are generally payable on a yearly basis.', u'Some countries or regional patent offices (e.g.', u'the European Patent Office) also require annual renewal fees to be paid for a patent application before it is granted.', u'==== Costs ====\nThe costs of preparing and filing a patent application, prosecuting it until grant and maintaining the patent vary from one jurisdiction to another, and may also be dependent upon the type and complexity of the invention, and on the type of patent.', u'The European Patent Office estimated in 2005 that the average cost of obtaining a European patent (via a Euro-direct application, i.e.', u'not based on a PCT application) and maintaining the patent for a 10-year term was around \u20ac32,000.', u'Since the London Agreement entered into force on May 1, 2008, this estimation is however no longer up-to-date, since fewer translations are required.', u'In the United States, in 2000 the cost of obtaining a patent (patent prosecution) was estimated to be from $10,000 to $30,000 per patent.', u'When patent litigation is involved (which in year 1999 happened in about 1,600 cases compared to 153,000 patents issued in the same year), costs increase significantly: although 95% of patent litigation cases are settled out of court, those that reach the courts have legal costs on the order of a million dollars per case, not including associated business costs.', u'=== Alternatives to applying for a patent ===\nA defensive publication is the act of publishing a detailed description of a new invention without patenting it, so as to establish prior art and public identification as the creator/originator of an invention, although a defensive publication can also be anonymous.', u'A defensive publication prevents others from later being able to patent the invention.', u'A trade secret is information that is intentionally kept confidential and that provides a competitive advantage to its possessor.', u'Trade secrets are protected by nondisclosure agreements and employment law, each of which prevents information leaks such as breaches of confidentiality and corporate espionage.', u'Compared to patents, the advantages of trade secrets are that the value of a trade secret continues until it is made public, whereas a patent is only in force for a specified time, after which others may freely copy the invention; does not require payment of fees to governmental agencies or filing paperwork; has an immediate effect; and does not require any disclosure of information to the public.', u'The key disadvantage of a trade secret is its vulnerability to reverse engineering.', u'== Benefits ==\nPrimary incentives embodied in the patent system include incentives to invent in the first place; to disclose the invention once made; to invest the sums necessary to experiment, produce and market the invention; and to design around and improve upon earlier patents.', u'Patents provide incentives for economically efficient research and development (R&D).', u'A study conducted annually by the IPTS shows that the 2,000 largest global companies invested more than 430 billion euros in 2008 in their R&D departments.', u'If the investments can be considered as inputs of R&D, real products and patents are the outputs.', u'Based on these groups, a project named Corporate Invention Board, had measured and analyzed the patent portfolios to produce an original picture of their technological profiles.', u'Supporters of patents argue that without patent protection, R&D spending would be significantly less or eliminated altogether, limiting the possibility of technological advances or breakthroughs.', u'Corporations would be much more conservative about the R&D investments they made, as third parties would be free to exploit any developments.', u'This second justification is closely related to the basic ideas underlying traditional property rights.', u'Specifically, "[t]he patent internalizes the externality by giving the [inventor] a property right over its invention."', u'A 2008 study by Yi Quan of Kellogg School of Management showed that countries instituting patent protection on pharmecuticals did not necessarily have an increase in domestic pharmaceutical innovation.', u'Only countries with "higher levels of economic development, educational attainment, and economic freedom" showed an increase.', u'There also appeared to be an optimal level of patent protection that increased domestic innovation.', u'In accordance with the original definition of the term "patent", patents are intended to facilitate and encourage disclosure of innovations into the public domain for the common good.', u'Thus patenting can be viewed as contributing to open hardware after an embargo period (usually of 20 years).', u'If inventors did not have the legal protection of patents, in many cases, they might prefer or tend to keep their inventions secret (e.g.', u'keep trade secrets).', u'Awarding patents generally makes the details of new technology publicly available, for exploitation by anyone after the patent expires, or for further improvement by other inventors.', u"Furthermore, when a patent's term has expired, the public record ensures that the patentee's invention is not lost to humanity.", u'In many industries (especially those with high fixed costs and either low marginal costs or low reverse engineering costs \u2014 computer processors, and pharmaceuticals for example), once an invention exists, the cost of commercialization (testing, tooling up a factory, developing a market, etc.)', u'is far more than the initial conception cost.', u'(For example, the internal rule of thumb at several computer companies in the 1980s was that post-R&D costs were 7-to-1.)', u'One effect of modern patent usage is that a small-time inventor, who can afford both the patenting process and the defense of the patent, can use the exclusive right status to become a licensor.', u'This allows the inventor to accumulate capital from licensing the invention and may allow innovation to occur because he or she may choose not to manage a manufacturing buildup for the invention.', u"Thus the inventor's time and energy can be spent on pure innovation, allowing others to concentrate on manufacturability.", u'Another effect of modern patent usage is to both enable and incentivize competitors to design around (or to "invent around" according to R S Praveen Raj) the patented invention.', u'This may promote healthy competition among manufacturers, resulting in gradual improvements of the technology base.', u'This may help augment national economies and confer better living standards to the citizens.', u'The 1970 Indian Patent Act allowed the Indian pharmaceutical industry to develop local technological capabilities in this industry.', u'This act coincided with the transformation of India from a bulk importer of pharmaceutical drugs to a leading exporter.', u'The rapid evolution of Indian pharmaceutical industry since the mid-1970s highlights the fact that the design of the patent act was instrumental in building local capabilities even in a developing country like India.', u'== Criticism ==\n\nLegal scholars, economists, activists, policymakers, industries, and trade organizations have held differing views on patents and engaged in contentious debates on the subject.', u'Critical perspectives emerged in the nineteenth century that were especially based on the principles of free trade.', u'Contemporary criticisms have echoed those arguments, claiming that patents block innovation and waste resources (e.g.', u'with patent-related overheads) that could otherwise be used productively to improve technology.', u'These and other research findings that patents decreased innovation because of the following mechanisms:\nLow quality, already known or obvious patents hamper innovation and commercialization.', u'Blocking the use of fundamental knowledge with patents creates a "tragedy of the anticommons, where future innovations can not take place outside of a single firm in an entire field.', u'Patents weaken the public domain and innovation that comes from it.', u'Patent thickets, or an "an overlapping set of patent rights", in particular slow innovation.', u'Broad patents prevent companies from commercializing products and hurt innovation.', u'In the worst case, such broad patents are held by non-practicing entities (patent trolls), which do not contribute to innovation.', u'Enforcement by patent trolls of poor quality patents  has led to criticism of the patent office as well as the system itself.', u'For example, in 2011, United States business entities incurred $29 billion in direct costs because of patent trolls.', u'Lawsuits brought by "patent assertion companies" made up 61% of all patent cases in 2012, according to the Santa Clara University School of Law.', u'Patents apply a "one size fits all" model to industries with differing needs, that is especially unproductive for the software industry.', u'Rent seeking by owners of pharmaceutical patents have also been a particular focus of criticism, as the high prices they enable puts life-saving drugs out of reach of many people.', u'Boldrin and Levine conclude "Our preferred policy solution is to abolish patents entirely and to find other legislative instruments, less open to lobbying and rent seeking, to foster innovation when there is clear evidence that laissez-faire undersupplies it."', u'Abolishing patents may be politically challenging in some countries, however, as the primary economic theories supporting patent law hold that inventors and innovators need patents to recoup the costs associated with research, inventing, and commercializing; this reasoning is weakened if the new technologies decrease these costs.', u'A 2016 paper argued for substantial weakening of patents because current technologies (e.g.', u'3-D printing, cloud computing, synthetic biology, etc.)', u'have reduced the cost of innovation.', u'Debates over the usefulness of patents for their primary objective are part of a larger discourse on intellectual property protection, which also reflects differing perspectives on copyright.', u'=== Anti-patent initiatives ===\nThe Patent Busting Project is an Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) initiative challenging patents that the organization claims are illegitimate and suppress innovation or limit online expression.', u'The initiative launched in 2004 and involves two phases: documenting the damage caused by these patents, and submitting challenges to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).', u'Patent critic, Joseph E. Stiglitz has proposed Prizes as an alternative to patents in order to further advance solutions to global problems such as AIDS.', u'In 2012, Stack Exchange launched Ask Patents, a forum for crowdsourcing prior art to invalidate patents.', u'Several authors have argued for developing defensive prior art to prevent patenting based on obviousness using lists  or algorithms.', u'For example, a Professor of Law at the University of North Carolina, has demonstrated a method to protect DNA research., which could can apply to other technology.', u'Chin wrote an algorithm to generate 11 million "obvious" nucleotide sequences to count as prior art and his algorithmic approach has already proven effective at anticipating prior art against oligonucleotide composition claims filed since his publication of the list and has been cited by the U.S. patent office a number of times.', u'More recently, Joshua Pearce developed an open-source algorithm for identifying prior art for 3-D printing materials to make such materials obvious by patent standards.', u'As the 3-D printing community is already grappling with legal issues, this development was hotly debated in the technical press.', u'Chin made the same algorithem-based obvious argument in DNA probes.', u'Google and other technology companies founded the LOT Network in 2014 to combat patent assertion entities by cross-licensing patents, thereby preventing legal action by such entities.', u'== See also ==\nList of people associated with patent law\nOutline of patents\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDirectory of Intellectual Property Offices, maintained by World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)\nUseful links, maintained by the European Patent Office\nOECD Patent statistics\nHenderson, David R.

them.', u'Veterans are also subject to illnesses directly related to their military service such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).', u'War veterans are generally treated with great respect and

to the dead.', u'In Russia, a tradition was established after World War II where newly married couples would on their wedding day visit a military cemetery.', u'In France, for instance, those wounded in war are given the first claim on any seat on public transit.', u'Most countries have a holiday such as Veterans Day to honour their veterans, along with the war dead.', u'In Zimbabwe the term veteran is used for political purpose and may not actually refer to someone that participated in a war, but still feels entitled to some benefit because of association with a cause for which there had been an actual war.', u"== Veterans' experiences around the world ==\n\n\n=== Britain ===\n\nBritain, with its historic distrust of standing armies, did little for its veterans before the 19th century.", u'It did set up two small hospitals for them in the 1680s.', u'In London and other cities the streets teemed with disabled or disfigured veterans begging for alms.', u'The First World War focused national attention on veterans, especially those who had been partly or wholly disabled.', u"The King's National Roll Scheme (KNRS) was an employment program for disabled veterans of the First World War.", u'Kowalsky says it was practical, innovative, and ahead of its time and was the most important piece of legislation enacted for disabled veterans in interwar Britain.', u'In addition to direct aid, it stimulate a national discussion regarding the need for employment programs for disabled veterans and the responsibility of the state, setting up a future demand for more benefits.', u'In the 21st century Britain has one of the highest densities of veterans in a major country, with 13 million in 2000, or 219 per 1000 population.', u'=== The Congo ===\n\nSome veterans from the Belgian commitment of the Congolese to WWII live in communities throughout the Congo.', u'Though they received compensation from the government during the rule of the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, after his overthrow they no longer receive pensions.', u'=== United States ===\n\nThe most common usage is for former armed services personnel.', u'A veteran is one who has served in the armed forces, especially one who has served in combat.', u'The National Guard and Reserve is included.', u'It is especially applied to those who served for an entire career, usually of 20 years or more, but may be applied for someone who has only served one tour of duty.', u'A common misconception is that only those who have served in combat or those who have retired from active duty can be called military veterans.', u'==== Veterans\' benefits in the United States ====\nPresident Abraham Lincoln, in his second inaugural address, in 1865 towards the end of the American Civil War, famously called for good treatment of veterans: "to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan".', u"The American Civil War produced veterans' organizations, such as the Grand Army of the Republic and United Confederate Veterans.", u'The treatment of veterans changed after the First World War.', u'In the years following, discontented veterans became a source of instability.', u'They could quickly organize, had links to the army, and often had arms themselves.', u'The Bonus Army of unemployed veterans was one of the most important protest movements of the Great Depression, marching on Washington, DC, to get a claimed bonus now that Congress had promised them decades in the future.', u"Each state of the United States sets specific criteria for state-specific veterans' benefits.", u'For federal medical benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals, prior to 7 September 1980 the veteran must have served at least 180 days of active duty, after the above-mentioned date, the veteran must have served at least 24 months.', u'However, if the veteran was medically discharged and receives a VA service-connected disability stipend, the time limits are not applicable.', u"==== American veteran experience after World War II ====\n\nAfter the Second World War, in part due to the experience of the First World War, most of the participating states set up elaborate veterans' administrations.", u'Within the United States, it was veterans groups, like the American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars organization, that pushed for and got the G.I.', u'Bill enacted.', u'These gave veterans access to free or subsidized education and health care.', u'The newly educated GIs created a significant economic impact, and with the aid of VA loans were able

veteran experience after OEF and OIF ====\nMany veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom have had to face challenges unique to warfare in the 21st century.', u'One significant difference between OEF and OIF and previous wars is a greater dependence on reservists and repeat deployments.', u'Up to 80% of troops deployed at the beginning of OEF were part of the National Guard and Reserve and about 40% of currently serving military members have been deployed more than once.', u'This has meant that many deployed troops, not being as \u201c steeped in military culture \u201d have had more difficult transitions into military life, and for many the increased redeployment rate has meant more transitions, more uncertainty, longer terms, and shorter dwell times, all of which contribute to greater stress.', u'Due to medical advances, warfare in the 21st century tends to yield more survivors with severe injuries which soldiers in previous wars would have died from.', u'This means that, though fewer service members die, more return from war with injuries more serious, and in turn more emotionally devastating, than ever before.', u'Among these injuries is the increasingly common traumatic brain injury, or TBI, the effects of which can range from a mild concussion to amnesia and serious neurological damage.', u'==== Female veterans in the U.S. ====\n\nWomen have served in the United States military for over two hundred years.', u'Some female veterans perceive themselves as discriminated against by their male counterparts and, as such, women who have served in the armed forces have sometimes been known as "the invisible veterans".', u'Women were not fully recognized as veterans until after WWII, and prior to this they were not eligible for VA benefits.', u'The current percentage of U.S. Veterans who are women is more than 8 percent.', u'Women make up nearly 11.6 percent of OEF/OIF/OND Veterans.', u'A tri-state (Washington, Idaho, Oregon) women veterans conference in Pendleton, Oregon, in April 2008, attracted 362 women veterans, according to the East Oregonian newspaper.', u'On August 5, 2011, Erica Borggren was appointed Director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs and has been "creating a new Women Veterans Program to help address the issue that women veterans often do not self-identify as veterans and do

than novae.', u'In Latin, nova means "new", referring astronomically to what appears to be a temporary new bright star.', u'Adding the prefix "super-" distinguishes supernovae from ordinary novae, which are far less luminous.', u'The word supernova was coined by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky in 1931.', u'It is pronounced /\u02ccsu\u02d0p\u0259rno\u028av\u0259/ with the plural supernovae /\u02ccsu\u02d0p\u0259rno\u028avi\u02d0/ or supernovas (abbreviated SN, plural SNe after "supernovae").', u'During maximum brightness, the total equivalent radiant energies produced by supernovae may briefly outshine an entire output of a typical galaxy and emit energies equal to that created over the lifetime of any solar-like star.', u'Such extreme catastrophes may also expel much, if not all, of its stellar material away from the star, at velocities up to 7007300000000000000\u266030,000 km/s or 10% of the speed of light.', u'This drives an expanding and fast-moving shock wave into the surrounding interstellar medium, and in turn, sweeping up an expanding shell of gas and dust, which is observed as a supernova remnant.', u'Supernovae create, fuse and eject the bulk of the chemical elements produced by nucleosynthesis.', u'Supernovae play a significant role in enriching the interstellar medium with the heavier atomic mass chemical elements.', u'Furthermore, the expanding shock waves from supernova explosions can trigger the formation of new stars.', u'Supernova remnants are expected to accelerate a large fraction of galactic primary cosmic rays, but direct evidence for cosmic ray production was found only in a few of them so far.', u'They are also potentially strong galactic sources of gravitational waves.', u"Theoretical studies of many supernovae indicate that most are triggered by one of two basic mechanisms: the sudden re-ignition of nuclear fusion in a degenerate star or the sudden gravitational collapse of a massive star's core.", u'In the first instance, a degenerate white dwarf may accumulate sufficient material from a binary companion, either through accretion or via a merger, to raise its core temperature enough to trigger runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting the star.', u'In the second case, the core of a massive star may undergo sudden gravitational collapse, releasing gravitational potential energy as a supernova.', u'While some observed supernovae are more complex than these two simplified theories, the astrophysical collapse mechanics have been established and accepted by most astronomers for some time.', u'Due to the wide range of astrophysical consequences of these events, astronomers now deem supernovae research, across the fields of stellar and galactic evolution, as an especially important area for investigation.', u'== Etymology ==\nIn Latin, Nova means "new", referring astronomically to what appears to be a temporary new bright star.', u'Adding the prefix "super-" distinguishes supernovae from ordinary novae, which are far less luminous.', u'The word supernova was coined by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky in 1931.', u'It is pronounced /\u02ccsu\u02d0p\u0259rno\u028av\u0259/ with the plural

by Chinese astronomers in 185 AD, with the brightest recorded supernova being SN 1006, which occurred in 1006 AD and was described in detail by Chinese and Islamic astronomers.', u'The widely observed supernova SN 1054 produced the Crab Nebula.', u'Supernovae SN 1572 and SN 1604, the latest to be observed with the naked eye in the Milky Way galaxy, had notable effects on the development of astronomy in Europe because they were used to argue against the Aristotelian idea that the universe beyond the Moon and planets was static and unchanging.', u'Johannes Kepler began observing SN 1604 at its peak on October 17, 1604, and continued to make estimates of its brightness until it faded from naked eye view a year later.', u'It was the second supernova to be observed in a generation (after SN 1572 seen by Tycho Brahe in Cassiopeia).', u'Before the development of the telescope, there have only been five supernovae seen in the last millennium.', u"In the perspective of how long a star's lifetime is, its death is very brief.", u"In fact, a star's death may only last a few months.", u'Due to this, a typical human will only experience this rarity, on average, once in their lifetime.', u'This is a microscopic fraction in comparison to the 100 billion stars that compose a galaxy.', u'However, since the use of modern equipment, particularly in this millennium, professional and amateur astronomers have been finding several hundreds of supernovae each year.', u'The field of supernova discovery has extended to other galaxies, starting with SN 1885A in the Andromeda galaxy.', u'American astronomers Rudolph Minkowski and Fritz Zwicky developed the modern supernova classification scheme beginning in 1941.', u'In the 1960s, astronomers found that the maximum intensities of supernova explosions could be used as standard candles, hence indicators of astronomical distances.', u'Some of the most distant supernovae recently observed appeared dimmer than expected.', u'This supports the view that the expansion of the universe is accelerating.', u'Techniques were developed for reconstructing supernova explosions that have no written records of being observed.', u'The date of the Cassiopeia A supernova event was determined from light echoes off nebulae, while the age of supernova remnant RX J0852.0-4622 was estimated from temperature measurements and the gamma ray emissions from the decay of titanium-44.', u'The brightest observed supernova, ASASSN-15lh, was detected in June 2015.', u"With a brightness of 570 billion Suns, ASASSN-15lh's peak luminosity was twice that of the previous record holder.", u'== Discovery ==\n\nEarly work on what was originally believed to be simply a new category of novae was performed during the 1930s by two astronomers named Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky at Mount Wilson Observatory.', u'The name super-novae was first used during 1931 lectures held at Caltech by Baade and Zwicky, then used publicly in 1933 at a meeting of the American Physical Society.', u'By 1938, the hyphen had been lost and the modern name was in use.', u'Because supernovae are relatively rare events within a galaxy, occurring about three times a century in the Milky Way, obtaining a good sample of supernovae to study requires regular monitoring of many galaxies.', u'Supernovae in other galaxies cannot be predicted with any meaningful accuracy.', u'Normally, when they are discovered, they are already in progress.', u'Most scientific interest in supernovae\u2014as standard candles for measuring distance, for example\u2014require an observation of their peak luminosity.', u'It is therefore important to discover them well before they reach their maximum.', u'Amateur astronomers, who greatly outnumber professional astronomers, have played an important role in finding supernovae, typically by looking at some of the closer galaxies through an optical telescope and comparing them to earlier photographs.', u'Toward the end of the 20th century astronomers increasingly turned to computer-controlled telescopes and CCDs for hunting supernovae.', u'While such systems are popular with amateurs, there are also professional installations such as the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope.', u'Recently the Supernova Early Warning System (SNEWS) project has begun using a network of neutrino detectors to give early warning of a supernova in the Milky Way galaxy.', u'Neutrinos are particles that are produced in great quantities by a supernova explosion, and they are not significantly absorbed by the interstellar gas and dust of the galactic disk.', u'Supernova searches fall into two classes: those focused on relatively nearby events and those looking for explosions farther away.', u'Because of the expansion of the universe, the distance to a remote object with a known emission spectrum can be estimated by measuring its Doppler shift (or redshift); on average, more distant objects recede with greater velocity than those nearby, and so have a higher redshift.', u"Thus the search is split between high redshift and low redshift, with the boundary falling around a redshift range of z = 0.1\u20130.3\u2014where z is a dimensionless measure of the spectrum's frequency shift.", u'High redshift searches for supernovae usually involve the observation of supernova light curves.', u'These are useful for standard or calibrated candles to generate Hubble diagrams and make cosmological predictions.', u'Supernova spectroscopy, used to study the physics and environments of supernovae, is more practical at low than at high redshift.', u'Low redshift observations also anchor the low-distance end of the Hubble curve, which is a plot of distance versus redshift for visible galaxies.', u"(See also Hubble's law).", u"== Naming convention ==\n\nSupernova discoveries are reported to the International Astronomical Union's Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, which sends out a circular with the name it assigns to that supernova.", u'The name is the marker SN followed by the year of discovery, suffixed with a one or two-letter designation.', u'The first 26 supernovae of the year are designated with a capital letter from A to Z.', u'Afterward pairs of lower-case letters are used: aa, ab, and so on.', u'Hence, for example, SN 2003C designates the third supernova reported in the year 2003.', u'The last supernova of 2005 was SN 2005nc, indicating that it was the 367th supernova found in 2005.', u'Since 2000, professional and amateur astronomers have been finding several hundreds of supernovae each year (572 in 2007, 261 in 2008, 390 in 2009; 231 in 2013).', u"Historical supernovae are known simply by the year they occurred: SN 185, SN 1006, SN 1054, SN 1572 (called Tycho's Nova) and SN 1604 (Kepler's Star).", u'Since 1885 the additional letter notation has been used, even if there was only one supernova discovered that year (e.g.', u'SN 1885A, SN 1907A, etc.)', u'\u2014 this last happened with SN 1947A.', u'SN, for SuperNova, is a standard prefix.', u'Until 1987, two-letter designations were rarely needed; since 1988, however, they have been needed every year.', u'== Classification ==\n\nAs part of the attempt to understand supernovae, astronomers have classified them according to their light curves and the absorption lines of different chemical elements that appear in their spectra.', u'The first element for division is the presence or absence of a line caused by hydrogen.', u"If a supernova's spectrum contains lines of hydrogen (known as the Balmer series in the visual portion of the spectrum) it is classified Type II; otherwise it is Type I.", u"In each of these two types there are subdivisions according to the presence of lines from other elements or the shape of the light curve (a graph of the supernova's apparent magnitude as a function of time).", u'=== Type I ===\nType I supernovae are subdivided on the basis of their spectra, with type Ia showing a strong ionised silicon absorption line.', u'Type I supernovae without this strong line are classified as Type Ib and Ic, with Type Ib showing strong neutral helium lines and Type Ic lacking them.', u'The light curves are all similar, although Type Ia are generally brighter at peak luminosity, but the light curve is not important for classification of Type I supernovae.', u'A small number of Type Ia supernovae exhibit unusual features such as non-standard luminosity or broadened light curves, and these are typically classified by referring to the earliest example showing similar features.', u'For example, the sub-luminous SN 2008ha is often referred to as SN 2002cx-like or class Ia-2002cx.', u'=== Type II ===\n\nThe supernovae of Type II can also be sub-divided based on their spectra.', u'While most Type II supernovae show very broad emission lines which indicate expansion velocities of many thousands of kilometres per second, some, such as SN 2005gl, have relatively narrow features in their spectra.', u"These are called Type IIn, where the 'n' stands for 'narrow'.", u'A few supernovae, such as SN 1987K and SN 1993J, appear to change types: they show lines of hydrogen at early times, but, over a period of weeks to months, become dominated by lines of helium.', u'The term "Type IIb" is used to describe the combination of features normally associated with Types II and Ib.', u'Type II supernovae with normal spectra dominated by broad hydrogen lines that remain for the life of the decline are classified on the basis of their light curves.', u'The most common type shows a distinctive "plateau" in the light curve shortly after peak brightness where the visual luminosity stays relatively constant for several months before the decline resumes.', u'These are called type II-P referring to the plateau.', u'Less common are type II-L supernovae that lack a distinct plateau.', u'The "L" signifies "linear" although the light curve is not actually a straight line.', u"Supernovae that do not fit into the normal classifications are designated peculiar, or 'pec'.", u"=== Types III, IV, and V ===\nFritz Zwicky defined additional supernovae types, although based on a very few examples that didn't cleanly fit the parameters for a Type I or Type II supernova.", u'SN 1961i in NGC 4303 was the prototype and only member of the Type III supernova class, noted for its broad light curve maximum and broad hydrogen Balmer lines that were slow to develop in the spectrum.', u'SN 1961f in NGC 3003 was the prototype and only member of the Type IV class, with a light curve similar to a Type II-P supernova, with hydrogen absorption lines but weak hydrogen emission lines.', u'The Type V class was coined for SN 1961V in NGC 1058, an unusual faint supernova or supernova imposter with a slow rise to brightness, a maximum lasting many months, and an unusual emission spectrum.', u'The similarity of SN 1961V to the Eta Carinae Great Outburst was noted.', u'Supernovae in M101 (1909) and M83 (1923 and 1957) were also suggested as possible type IV or type V supernovae.', u'These types would now all be treated as peculiar Type II supernovae, of which many more examples have been discovered, although it is still debated whether SN 1961V was a true supernova following an LBV outburst or an imposter.', u'== Current models ==\n\nThe type codes, described above given to supernovae, are taxonomic in nature: the type number describes the light observed from the supernova, not necessarily its cause.', u'For example, type Ia supernovae are produced by runaway fusion ignited on degenerate white dwarf progenitors while the spectrally similar type Ib/c are produced from massive Wolf-Rayet progenitors by core collapse.', u'The following summarizes what is currently believed to be the most plausible explanations for supernovae.', u'=== Thermal runaway ===\n\nA white dwarf star may accumulate sufficient material from a stellar companion to raise its core temperature enough to ignite carbon fusion, at which point it undergoes runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting it.', u'There are three avenues by which this detonation is theorized to happen: stable accretion of material from a companion, the collision of two white dwarfs, or accretion that causes ignition in a shell that then ignites.', u'The dominant mechanism by which Type Ia supernovae are produced remains unclear.', u'Despite this uncertainty in how Type Ia supernovae are produced, Type Ia supernovae have very uniform properties, and are useful standard candles over intergalactic distances.', u'Some calibrations are required to compensate for the gradual change in properties or different frequencies of abnormal luminosity supernovae at high red shift, and for small variations in brightness identified by light curve shape or spectrum.', u'==== Normal Type Ia ====\nThere are several means by which a supernova of this type can form, but they share a common underlying mechanism.', u'If a carbon-oxygen white dwarf accreted enough matter to reach the Chandrasekhar limit of about 1.44 solar masses (M\u2609) (for a non-rotating star), it would no longer be able to support the bulk of its mass through electron degeneracy pressure and would begin to collapse.', u'However, the current view is that this limit is not normally attained; increasing temperature and density inside the core ignite carbon fusion as the star approaches the limit (to within about 1%), before collapse is initiated.', u'Within a few seconds, a substantial fraction of the matter in the white dwarf undergoes nuclear fusion, releasing enough energy (1\u20137044200000000000000\u26602\xd71044 J) to unbind the star in a supernova explosion.', u'An outwardly expanding shock wave is generated, with matter reaching velocities on the order of 5,000\u201320,000 km/s, or roughly 3% of the speed of light.', u'There is also a significant increase in luminosity, reaching an absolute magnitude of \u221219.3 (or 5 billion times brighter than the Sun), with little variation.', u'The model for the formation of this category of supernova is a closed binary star system.', u'The larger of the two stars is the first to evolve off the main sequence, and it expands to form a red giant.', u'The two stars now share a common envelope, causing their mutual orbit to shrink.', u'The giant star then sheds most of its envelope, losing mass until it can no longer continue nuclear fusion.', u'At this point it becomes a white dwarf star, composed primarily of carbon and oxygen.', u'Eventually the secondary star also evolves off the main sequence to form a red giant.', u'Matter from the giant is accreted by the white dwarf, causing the latter to increase in mass.', u'Despite widespread acceptance of the basic model, the exact details of initiation and of the heavy elements produced in the explosion are still unclear.', u'Type Ia supernovae follow a characteristic light curve\u2014the graph of luminosity as a function of time\u2014after the explosion.', u'This luminosity is generated by the radioactive decay of nickel-56 through cobalt-56 to iron-56.', u'The peak luminosity of the light curve is extremely consistent across normal Type Ia supernovae, having a maximum absolute magnitude of about \u221219.3.', u'This allows them to be used as a secondary standard candle to measure the distance to their host galaxies.', u'==== Non-standard Type Ia ====\nAnother model for the formation of a Type Ia explosion involves the merger of two white dwarf stars, with the combined mass momentarily exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit.', u'There is much variation in this type of explosion, and in many cases there may be no supernova at all, but it is expected that they will have a broader and less luminous light curve than the more normal Type Ia explosions.', u'Abnormally bright Type Ia supernovae are expected when the white dwarf already has a mass higher than the Chandrasekhar limit, possibly enhanced further by asymmetry, but the ejected material will have less than normal kinetic energy.', u'There is no formal sub-classification for the non-standard Type Ia supernovae.', u'It has been proposed that a group of sub-luminous supernovae that occur when helium accretes onto a white dwarf should be classified as type Iax.', u'This type of supernova may not always completely destroy the white dwarf progenitor and could leave behind a zombie star.', u'One specific type of non-standard Type Ia supernova develops hydrogen, and other, emission lines and gives the appearance of mixture between a normal Type Ia and a Type IIn supernova.', u'Examples are SN 2002ic and SN 2005gj.', u'These supernova have been dubbed Type Ia/IIn, Type Ian, Type IIa and Type IIan.', u'=== Core collapse ===\n\nVery massive stars can undergo core collapse when nuclear fusion suddenly becomes unable to sustain the core against its own gravity; this is the cause of all types of supernova except type Ia.', u'The collapse may cause violent expulsion of the outer layers of the star resulting in a supernova, or the release of gravitational potential energy may be insufficient and the star may collapse into a black hole or neutron star with little radiated energy.', u'Core collapse can be caused by several different mechanisms: electron capture; exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit; pair-instability; or photodisintegration.', u'When a massive star develops an iron core larger than the Chandrasekhar mass it will no longer be able to support itself by electron degeneracy pressure and will collapse further to a neutron star or black hole.', u'Electron capture by magnesium in a degenerate O/Ne/Mg core causes gravitational collapse followed by explosive oxygen fusion, with very similar results.', u'Electron-positron pair production in a large post-helium burning core removes thermodynamic support and causes initial collapse followed by runaway fusion, resulting in a pair-instability supernova.', u'A sufficiently large and hot stellar core may generate gamma-rays energetic enough to initiate photodisintegration directly, which will cause a complete collapse of the core.', u'The table below lists the known reasons for core collapse in massive stars, the types of star that they occur in, their associated supernova type, and the remnant produced.', u'The metallicity is the proportion of elements other than hydrogen or helium, as compared to the Sun.', u"The initial mass is the mass of the star prior to the supernova event, given in multiples of the Sun's mass, although the mass at the time of the supernova may be much lower.", u'Type IIn supernovae are not listed in the table.', u'They can potentially be produced by various types of core collapse in different progenitor stars, possibly even by type Ia white dwarf ignitions, although it seems that most will be from iron core collapse in luminous supergiants or hypergiants (including LBVs).', u'The narrow spectral lines for which they are named occur because the supernova is expanding into a small dense cloud of circumstellar material.', u'It appears that a significant proportion of supposed type IIn supernovae are actually supernova imposters, massive eruptions of LBV-like stars similar to the Great Eruption of Eta Carinae.', u'In these events, material previously ejected from the star creates the narrow absorption lines and causes a shock wave through interaction with the newly ejected material.', u'When a stellar core is no longer supported against gravity it collapses in on itself with velocities reaching 70,000 km/s (0.23c), resulting in a rapid increase in temperature and density.', u'What follows next depends on the mass and structure of the collapsing core, with low mass degenerate cores forming neutron stars, higher mass degenerate cores mostly collapsing completely to black holes, and non-degenerate cores undergoing runaway fusion.', u'The initial collapse of degenerate cores is accelerated by beta decay, photodisintegration and electron capture, which causes a burst of electron neutrinos.', u'As the density increases, neutrino emission is cut off as they become trapped in the core.', u'The inner core eventually reaches typically 30 km diameter and a density comparable to that of an atomic nucleus, and neutron degeneracy pressure tries to halt the collapse.', u'If the core mass is more than about 15 M\u2609 then neutron degeneracy is insufficient to stop the collapse and a black hole forms directly with no supernova explosion.', u"In lower mass cores the collapse is stopped and the newly formed neutron core has an initial temperature of about 100 billion kelvin, 6000 times the temperature of the sun's core.", u'At this temperature, neutrino-antineutrino pairs of all flavors are efficiently formed by thermal emission.', u'These thermal neutrinos are several times more abundant than the electron-capture neutrinos.', u"About 1046 joules, approximately 10% of the star's rest mass, is converted into a ten-second burst of neutrinos which is the main output of the event.", u'The suddenly halted core collapse rebounds and produces a shock wave that stalls within milliseconds in the outer core as energy is lost through the dissociation of heavy elements.', u'A process that is not clearly understood is necessary to allow the outer layers of the core to reabsorb around 1044 joules (1 foe) from the neutrino pulse, producing the visible explosion, although there are also other theories on how to power the explosion.', u'Some material from the outer envelope falls back onto the neutron star, and for cores beyond about 8 M\u2609 there is sufficient fallback to form a black hole.', u'This fallback will reduce the kinetic energy of the explosion and the mass of expelled radioactive material, but in some situations it may also generate relativistic jets that result in a gamma-ray burst or an exceptionally luminous supernova.', u'Collapse of massive non-degenerate cores will ignite further fusion.', u'When the core collapse is initiated by pair instability, oxygen fusion begins and the collapse may be halted.', u'For core masses of 40\u201360 M\u2609, the collapse halts and the star remains intact, but core collapse will occur again when a larger core has formed.', u'For cores of around 60\u2013130 M\u2609, the fusion of oxygen and heavier elements is so energetic that the entire star is disrupted, causing a supernova.', u'At the upper end of the mass range, the supernova is unusually luminous and extremely long-lived due to many solar masses of ejected 56Ni.', u'For even larger core masses, the core temperature becomes high enough to allow photodisintegration and the core collapses completely into a black hole.', u'==== Type II ====\n\nStars with initial masses less than about eight times the sun never develop a core large enough to collapse and they eventually lose their atmospheres to become white dwarfs.', u'Stars with at least 9 M\u2609 (possibly as much as 12 M\u2609) evolve in a complex fashion, progressively burning heavier elements at hotter temperatures in their cores.', u'The star becomes layered like an onion, with the burning of more easily fused elements occurring in larger shells.', u'Although popularly described as an onion with an iron core, the least massive supernova progenitors only have oxygen-neon(-magnesium) cores.', u'These super AGB stars may form the majority of core collapse supernovae, although less luminous and so less commonly observed than those from more massive progenitors.', u'If core collapse occurs during a supergiant phase when the star still has a hydrogen envelope, the result is a Type II supernova.', u'The rate of mass loss for luminous stars depends on the metallicity and luminosity.', u'Extremely luminous stars at near solar metallicity will lose all their hydrogen before they reach core collapse and so will not form a type II supernova.', u'At low metallicity, all stars will reach core collapse with a hydrogen envelope but sufficiently massive stars collapse directly to a black hole without producing a visible supernova.', u'Stars with an initial mass up to about 90 times the sun, or a little less at high metallicity, are expected to result in a type II-P supernova which is the most commonly observed type.', u'At moderate to high metallicity, stars near the upper end of that mass range will have lost most of their hydrogen when core collapse occurs and the result will be a Type II-L supernova.', u'At very low metallicity, stars of around 140\u2013250 M\u2609 will reach core collapse by pair instability while they still have a hydrogen atmosphere and an oxygen core and the result will be a supernova with Type II characteristics but a very large mass of ejected 56Ni and high luminosity.', u'==== Type Ib and Ic ====\n\nThese supernovae, like those of Type II, are massive stars that undergo core collapse.', u'However the stars which become Types Ib and Ic supernovae have lost most of their outer (hydrogen) envelopes due to strong stellar winds or else from interaction with a companion.', u'These stars are known as Wolf-Rayet stars, and they occur at moderate to high metallicity where continuum driven winds cause sufficiently high mass loss rates.', u'Observations of type Ib/c supernova do not match the observed or expected occurrence of Wolf Rayet stars and alternate explanations for this type of core collapse supernova involve stars stripped of their hydrogen by binary interactions.', u'Binary models provide a better match for the observed supernovae, with the proviso that no suitable binary helium stars have ever been observed.', u'Since a supernova explosion can occur whenever the mass of the star at the time of core collapse is low enough not to cause complete fallback to a black hole, any massive star may result in a supernova if it loses enough mass before core collapse occurs.', u'Type Ib supernovae are the more common and result from Wolf-Rayet stars of type WC which still have helium in their atmospheres.', u'For a narrow range of masses, stars evolve further before reaching core collapse to become WO stars with very little helium remaining and these are the progenitors of type Ic supernovae.', u'A few percent of the Type Ic supernovae are associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRB), though it is also believed that any hydrogen-stripped Type Ib or Ic supernova could produce a GRB, depending on the geometry of the explosion.', u'The mechanism for producing this type of GRB is the jets produced by the magnetic field of the rapidly spinning magnetar formed at the collapsing core of the star.', u'The jets would also transfer energy into the expanding outer shell of the explosion to produce a super-luminous supernova.', u'Ultra-stripped supernovae occur when the exploding star has been stripped (almost) all the way to the metal core, via mass transfer in a close binary.', u'As a result, very little material is ejected from the exploding star (~0.1 MSun).', u'In the most extreme cases, ultra-stripped supernovae can occur in naked metal cores, barely above the Chandrasekhar mass limit.', u'SN 2005ek might be an observational example of an ultra-stripped supernova, giving rise to a relatively dim and fast decaying light curve.', u'The nature of ultra-stripped supernovae can be both iron core-collapse and electron capture supernovae, depending on the mass of the collapsing core.', u'=== Failed ===\nThe core collapse of some massive stars may not result in a visible supernova.', u'The main model for this is a sufficiently massive core that the explosion is insufficient to reverse the infall of the outer layers onto a black hole.', u'These events are difficult to detect, but large surveys have detected possible candidates.', u'=== Light curves ===\n\nA historic puzzle concerned the source of energy that can maintain the optical supernova glow for months.', u'Although the energy that disrupts each type of supernovae is delivered promptly, the light curves are mostly dominated by subsequent radioactive heating of the rapidly expanding ejecta.', u'Some have considered rotational energy from the central pulsar.', u'The ejecta gases would dim quickly without some energy input to keep it hot.', u'The intensely radioactive nature of the ejecta gases, which is now known to be correct for most supernovae, was first calculated on sound nucleosynthesis grounds in the late 1960s.', u'It was not until SN 1987A that direct observation of gamma-ray lines unambiguously identified the major radioactive nuclei.', u'It is now known by direct observation that much of the light curve (the graph of luminosity as a function of time) after the explosion of a Type II Supernova such as SN 1987A is provided its energy by those predicted radioactive decays.', u'Although the luminous emission consists of optical photons, it is the radioactive power absorbed by the ejected gases that keeps the remnant hot enough to radiate light.', u'The radioactive decay of 56Ni through its daughters 56Co to 56Fe produces gamma-ray photons , primarily of 847keV and 1238keV, that are absorbed and dominate the heating and thus the luminosity of the ejecta at intermediate times (several weeks) to late times (several months).', u'Energy for the peak of the light curve of SN1987A was provided by the decay of 56Ni to 56Co (half life 6 days) while energy for the later light curve in particular fit very closely with the 77.3 day half-life of 56Co decaying to 56Fe.', u'Later measurements by space gamma-ray telescopes of the small fraction of the 56Co and 57Co gamma rays that escaped the SN 1987A remnant without absorption confirmed earlier predictions that those two radioactive nuclei were the power sources.', u'The visual light curves of the different supernova types all depend at late times on radioactive heating, but they vary in shape and amplitude on the underlying mechanisms of the explosion, the way that visible radiation is produced, the epoch of its observation, and the transparency of the ejected material.', u'The light curves can be significantly different at other wavelengths.', u'For example, at ultraviolet wavelengths there is an early extremely luminous peak lasting only a few hours corresponding to the breakout of the shock launched by the initial explosion, but that breakout is hardly detectable optically.', u'The light curves for type Ia are mostly very uniform, with a consistent maximum absolute magnitude and a relatively steep decline in luminosity.', u'Their optical energy output is driven by radioactive decay of nickel-56 (half life 6 days), which then decays to radioactive cobalt-56 (half life 77 days).', u'These radioisotopes from material ejected in the explosion excite surrounding material to incandescence.', u'Studies of cosmology today rely on 56Ni radioactivity providing the energy for the optical brightness of supernovae of Type Ia, which are the "standard candles" of cosmology but whose diagnostic 847keV and 1238keV gamma rays were first detected only in 2014.', u'The initial phases of the light curve decline steeply as the effective size of the photosphere decreases and trapped electromagnetic radiation is depleted.', u'The light curve continues to decline in the B band while it may show a small shoulder in the visual at about 40 days, but this is only a hint of a secondary maximum that occurs in the infra-red as certain ionised heavy elements recombine to produce infra-red radiation and the ejecta become transparent to it.', u'The visual light curve continues to decline at a rate slightly greater than the decay rate of the radioactive cobalt (which has the longer half life and controls the later curve), because the ejected material becomes more diffuse and less able to convert the high energy radiation into visual radiation.', u'After several months, the light curve changes its decline rate again as positron emission becomes dominant from the remaining cobalt-56, although this portion of the light curve has been little-studied.', u'Type Ib and Ic light curves are basically similar to type Ia although with a lower average peak luminosity.', u'The visual light output is again due to radioactive decay being converted into visual radiation, but there is a much lower mass of nickel-56 produced in these types of explosion.', u'The peak luminosity varies considerably and there are even occasional type Ib/c supernovae orders of magnitude more and less luminous than the norm.', u'The most luminous type Ic supernovae are referred to as hypernovae and tend to have broadened light curves in addition to the increased peak luminosity.', u'The source of the extra energy is thought to be relativistic jets driven by the formation of a rotating black hole, which also produce gamma-ray bursts.', u'The light curves for type II supernovae are characterised by a much slower decline than type I, on the order of 0.05 magnitudes per day, excluding the plateau phase.', u'The visual light output is dominated by kinetic energy rather than radioactive decay for several months, due primarily to the existence of hydrogen in the ejecta from the atmosphere of the supergiant progenitor star.', u'In the initial explosion this hydrogen becomes heated and ionised.', u'The majority of type II supernovae show a prolonged plateau in their light curves as this hydrogen recombines, emitting visible light and becoming more transparent.', u'This is then followed by a declining light curve driven by radioactive decay although slower than in type I supernovae, due to the efficiency of conversion into light by all the hydrogen.', u'In type II-L the plateau is absent because the progenitor had relatively little hydrogen left in its atmosphere, sufficient to appear in the spectrum but insufficient to produce a noticeable plateau in the light output.', u'In type IIb supernovae the hydrogen atmosphere of the progenitor is so depleted (thought to be due to tidal stripping by a companion star) that the light curve is closer to a type I supernova and the hydrogen even disappears from the spectrum after several weeks.', u'Type IIn supernovae are characterised by additional narrow spectral lines produced in a dense shell of circumstellar material.', u'Their light curves are generally very broad and extended, occasionally also extremely luminous and referred to as a hypernova.', u'These light curves are produced by the highly efficient conversion of kinetic energy of the ejecta into electromagnetic radiation by interaction with the dense shell of material.', u'This only occurs when the material is sufficiently dense and compact, indicating that it has been produced by the progenitor star itself only shortly before the supernova occurs.', u'Large numbers of supernovae have been catalogued and classified to provide distance candles and test models.', u'Average characteristics vary somewhat with distance and type of host galaxy, but can broadly be specified for each supernova type.', u'Notes:\n\n\n=== Asymmetry ===\n\nA long-standing puzzle surrounding Type II supernovae is why the compact object remaining after the explosion is given a large velocity away from the epicentre; pulsars, and thus neutron stars, are observed to have high velocities, and black holes presumably do as well, although they are far harder to observe in isolation.', u'The initial impetus can be substantial, propelling an object of more than a solar mass at a velocity of 500 km/s or greater.', u'This indicates an asymmetry in the explosion, but the mechanism by which momentum is transferred to the compact object remains a puzzle.', u'Proposed explanations for this kick include convection in the collapsing star and jet production during neutron star formation.', u'One possible explanation for the asymmetry in the explosion is large-scale convection above the core.', u'The convection can create variations in the local abundances of elements, resulting in uneven nuclear burning during the collapse, bounce and resulting explosion.', u'Another possible explanation is that accretion of gas onto the central neutron star can create a disk that drives highly directional jets, propelling matter at a high velocity out of the star, and driving transverse shocks that completely disrupt the star.', u'These jets might play a crucial role in the resulting supernova explosion.', u'(A similar model is now favored for explaining long gamma-ray bursts.)', u'Initial asymmetries have also been confirmed in Type Ia supernova explosions through observation.', u'This result may mean that the initial luminosity of this type of supernova depends on the viewing angle.', u'However, the explosion becomes more symmetrical with the passage of time.', u'Early asymmetries are detectable by measuring the polarization of the emitted light.', u'=== Energy output ===\n\nAlthough we are used to thinking of supernovae primarily as luminous visible events, the electromagnetic radiation they release is almost a minor side-effect of the explosion.', u'Particularly in the case of core collapse supernovae, the emitted electromagnetic radiation is a tiny fraction of the total energy released during the event.', u'There is a fundamental difference between the balance of energy production in the different types of supernova.', u'In type Ia white dwarf detonations, most of the energy is directed into heavy element synthesis and the kinetic energy of the ejecta.', u'In core collapse supernovae, the vast majority of the energy is directed into neutrino emission, and while some of this apparently powers the following main explosion 99%+ of the neutrinos escape the star in the first few minutes following the start of the collapse.', u'Type Ia supernovae derive their energy from a runaway nuclear fusion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf.', u'The details of the energetics are still not fully understood, but the end result is the ejection of the entire mass of the original star at high kinetic energy.', u'Around half a solar mass of that mass is 56Ni generated from silicon burning.', u'56Ni is radioactive and decays into 56Co by beta plus decay (with a half life of six days) and gamma rays.', u'56Co itself decays by the beta plus (an anti-electron) path with a half life of 77 days into stable 56Fe.', u'These two processes are responsible for the electromagnetic radiation from type Ia supernovae.', u'In combination with the changing transparency of the ejected material, they produce the rapidly declining light curve.', u'Core collapse supernovae are on average visually fainter than type Ia supernovae, but the total energy released is far higher.', u'In the case of supernovae, the energy of gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy that compresses and collapses the core, initially producing electron neutrinos from disintegrating nucleons, followed by all flavours of thermal neutrinos from the super-heated neutron star core.', u'Around 1% of these neutrinos are thought to deposit sufficient energy into the outer layers of the star to drive the resulting explosion, but again the details cannot be reproduced exactly in current models.', u'Kinetic energies and nickel yields are somewhat lower than type Ia supernovae, hence the lower visual luminosity of supernovae, but energy from the de-ionisation of the many solar masses of remaining hydrogen can contribute to a much slower decline in luminosity and produce the plateau phase seen in the majority of core collapse supernovae.', u'In some core collapse supernovae, fallback onto a black hole drives relativistic jets which may produce a brief energetic and directional burst of gamma rays and also transfers substantial further energy into the ejected material.', u'This is one scenario for producing high luminosity supernovae and is thought to be the cause of type Ic hypernovae and long duration gamma-ray bursts.', u'If the relativistic jets are too brief and fail to penetrate the stellar envelope then a low luminosity gamma-ray burst may be produced and the supernova may be sub-luminous.', u'When a supernova occurs inside a small dense cloud of circumstellar material, it will produce a shock wave that can efficiently convert a high fraction of the kinetic energy into electromagnetic radiation.', u'Even though the initial explosion energy was entirely normal the resulting supernova will have high luminosity and extended duration since it does not rely on exponential radioactive decay.', u'This type of event may cause type IIn hypernovae.', u'Although pair-instability supernovae are core collapse supernovae with spectra and light curves similar to type II-P, the nature of that explosion following core collapse is more like that of a giant type Ia with runaway fusion of carbon, oxygen, and silicon.', u'The total energy released by the highest mass events is comparable to other core collapse supernovae but neutrino production is thought to be very low, hence the kinetic and electromagnetic energy released is very high.', u'The cores of these stars are much larger than any white dwarf and the amount of radioactive nickel and other heavy elements ejected from their cores can be orders of magnitude higher, with consequently high visual luminosity.', u'=== Progenitor ===\n\nThe supernova classification type is closely tied to the type of star at the time of the explosion.', u'The occurrence of each type of supernova depends dramatically on the metallicity and hence the age of the host galaxy.', u'Type Ia supernovae are produced from white dwarf stars in binary systems and occur in all galaxy types.', u'Core collapse supernovae are only found in galaxies undergoing current or very recent star formation, since they result from short-lived massive stars.', u'They are most commonly found in type Sc spirals, but also in the arms of other spiral galaxies and in irregular galaxies, especially starburst galaxies.', u'Type Ib/c and II-L, and possibly most type IIn, supernovae are only thought to be produced from stars having near-solar metallicity levels that result in high mass loss from massive stars, hence they are less common in older more distant galaxies.', u'The table shows the expected progenitor for the main types of core collapse supernova, and the approximate proportions of each in the local neighbourhood.', u'There are a number of difficulties reconciling modelled and observed stellar evolution leading up to core collapse supernovae.', u'Red supergiants are the expected progenitors for the vast majority of core collapse supernovae, and these have been observed but only at relatively low masses and luminosities, below about 18 M\u2609 and 100,000 L\u2609 respectively.', u'Most progenitors of type II supernovae are not detected and must be considerably fainter, and presumably less massive.', u'It is now proposed that higher mass red supergiants do not explode as supernovae, but instead evolve back towards hotter temperatures.', u'Several progenitors of type IIb supernovae have been confirmed, and these were K and G supergiants, plus one A supergiant.', u'Yellow hypergiants or LBVs are proposed progenitors for type IIb supernovae, and almost all type IIb supernovae near enough to observe have shown such progenitors.', u'Until just a few decades ago, hot supergiants were not considered likely to explode, but observations have shown otherwise.', u'Blue supergiants form an unexpectedly high proportion of confirmed supernova progenitors, partly due to their high luminosity and easy detection, while not a single Wolf-Rayet progenitor has yet been clearly identified.', u'Models have had difficulty showing how blue supergiants lose enough mass to reach supernova without progressing to a different evolutionary stage.', u'One study has shown a possible route for low-luminosity post-red supergiant luminous blue variables to collapse, most likely as a type IIn supernova.', u'The expected progenitors of type Ib supernovae, luminous WC stars, are not observed at all.', u'Instead WC stars are found at lower luminosities, apparently post-red supergiant stars.', u'WO stars are extremely rare and visually relatively faint, so it is difficult to say whether such progenitors are missing or just yet to be observed.', u'Very luminous progenitors, despite numerous supernovae being observed near enough that such progenitors would have been clearly imaged.', u'Several examples of hot luminous progenitors of type IIn supernovae have been detected: SN 2005gy and SN 2010jl were both apparently massive luminous stars, but are very distant; and SN 2009ip had a highly luminous progenitor likely to have been an LBV, but is a peculiar supernova whose exact nature is disupted.', u'== Interstellar impact ==\n\n\n=== Source of heavy elements ===\n\nSupernovae are the major source of elements heavier than oxygen.', u'These elements are produced by nuclear fusion for nuclei up to 34S, by silicon photodisintegration rearrangement and quasiequilibrium (see Supernova nucleosynthesis) during silicon burning for nuclei between 36Ar and 56Ni, and by rapid captures of neutrons during the supernova explosion for elements heavier than iron.', u'Nucleosynthesis during silicon burning yields nuclei roughly 1000-100,000 times more abundant than the r-process isotopes heavier than iron.', u'Supernovae are the most likely, although not undisputed, candidate sites for the r-process, which is the rapid capture of neutrons that occurs at high temperature and high density of neutrons.', u'Those reactions produce highly unstable nuclei that are rich in neutrons and that rapidly beta decay into more stable forms.', u'The r-process produces about half of all the heavier isotopes of the elements beyond iron, including plutonium and uranium.', u'The only other major competing process for producing elements heavier than iron is the s-process in large, old, red-giant AGB stars, which produces these elements slowly over longer epochs and which cannot produce elements heavier than lead.', u'=== Role in stellar evolution ===\n\nThe remnant of a supernova explosion consists of a compact object and a rapidly expanding shock wave of material.', u'This cloud of material sweeps up the surrounding interstellar medium during a free expansion phase, which can last for up to two centuries.', u'The wave then gradually undergoes a period of adiabatic expansion, and will slowly cool and mix with the surrounding interstellar medium over a period of about 10,000 years.', u'The Big Bang produced hydrogen, helium, and traces of lithium, while all heavier elements are synthesized in stars and supernovae.', u'Supernovae tend to enrich the surrounding interstellar medium with metals\u2014elements other than hydrogen and helium.', u'These injected elements ultimately enrich the molecular clouds that are the sites of star formation.', u'Thus, each stellar generation has a slightly different composition, going from an almost pure mixture of hydrogen and helium to a more metal-rich composition.', u'Supernovae are the dominant mechanism for distributing these heavier elements, which are formed in a star during its period of nuclear fusion.', u"The different abundances of elements in the material that forms a star have important influences on the star's life, and may decisively influence the possibility of having planets orbiting it.", u'The kinetic energy of an expanding supernova remnant can trigger star formation due to compression of nearby, dense molecular clouds in space.', u'The increase in turbulent pressure can also prevent star formation if the cloud is unable to lose the excess energy.', u'Evidence from daughter products of short-lived radioactive isotopes shows that a nearby supernova helped determine the composition of the Solar System 4.5 billion years ago, and may even have triggered the formation of this system.', u'Supernova production of heavy elements over astronomic periods of time ultimately made the chemistry of life on Earth possible.', u'=== Effect on Earth ===\n\nA near-Earth supernova is a supernova close enough to the Earth to have noticeable effects on its biosphere.', u'Depending upon the type and energy of the supernova, it could be as far as 3000 light-years away.', u'Gamma rays from a supernova would induce a chemical reaction in the upper atmosphere converting molecular nitrogen into nitrogen oxides, depleting the ozone layer enough to expose the surface to harmful solar radiation.', u'This has been proposed as the cause of the Ordovician\u2013Silurian extinction, which resulted in the death of nearly 60% of the oceanic life on Earth.', u'In 1996 it was theorized that traces of past supernovae might be detectable on Earth in the form of metal isotope signatures in rock strata.', u'Iron-60 enrichment was later reported in deep-sea rock of the Pacific Ocean.', u'In 2009, elevated levels of nitrate ions were found in Antarctic ice, which coincided with the 1006 and 1054 supernovae.', u'Gamma rays from these supernovae could have boosted levels of nitrogen oxides, which became trapped in the ice.', u'Type Ia supernovae are thought to be potentially the most dangerous if they occur close enough to the Earth.', u'Because these supernovae arise from dim, common white dwarf stars in binary systems, it is likely that a supernova that can affect the Earth will occur unpredictably and in a star system that is not well studied.', u'The closest known candidate is IK Pegasi (see below).', u"Recent estimates predict that a Type II supernova would have to be closer than eight parsecs (26 light-years) to destroy half of the Earth's ozone layer, and there are no such candidates closer than about 500 light years.", u'== Milky Way candidates ==\n\nThe next supernova in the Milky Way will likely be detectable even if it occurs on the far side of the galaxy.', u'It is likely to be produced by the collapse of an unremarkable red supergiant and it is very probable that it will already have been catalogued in infrared surveys such as 2MASS.', u'There is a smaller chance that the next core collapse supernova will be produced by a different type of massive star such as a yellow hypergiant, luminous blue variable, or Wolf-Rayet.', u'The chances of the next supernova being a type Ia produced by a white dwarf are calculated to be about a third of those for a core collapse supernova.', u'Again it should be observable wherever it occurs, but it is less likely that the progenitor will ever have been observed prior to the explosion.', u"It isn't even known exactly what a type Ia progenitor system looks like, and difficult to detect them beyond a few parsecs.", u"The total supernova rate in our galaxy is estimated to be about 4.6 per century, or one every 22 years, although we haven't actually observed one for several centuries.", u'Statistically, the next supernova is likely to be produced from an otherwise unremarkable red supergiant, but it is difficult to identify which of those supergiants are in the final stages of heavy element fusion in their cores and which have millions of years left.', u'The most massive red supergiants are expected to shed their atmospheres and evolve to Wolf-Rayet stars before their cores collapse.', u'All Wolf-Rayet stars are expected to end their lives from the Wolf-Rayet phase within a million years or so, but again it is difficult to identify those that are closest to core collapse.', u'One class that is expected to have no more than a few thousand years before exploding are the WO Wolf-Rayet stars, which are known to have exhausted their core helium.', u'Only eight of them are known, and only four of those are in the Milky Way.', u'A number of close or well known stars have been identified as possible core collapse supernova candidates: the red supergiants Antares and Betelgeuze; the yellow hypergiant Rho Cassiopeiae; the luminous blue variable Eta Carinae that has already produced a supernova imposter explosion; and the brightest component, a Wolf\u2013Rayet star in the Regor or Gamma Velorum system, Others have gained notoriety as possible, although not very likely, progenitors for a gamma-ray burst; for example WR 104.', u'Identification of candidates for a type Ia supernova explosion is much more speculative.', u'Any binary with an accreting white dwarf might produce a supernova although the exact mechanism and timescale is still debated.', u'These systems are faint and difficult to identify, but the novae and recurrent novae are such systems that conveniently advertise themselves.', u'One examples is U Scorpii, The nearest known type Ia supernova candidate is IK Pegasi (HR 8210), located at a distance of 150 light-years, but observations suggest it will be several million years before the white dwarf can accrete the critical mass required to become a Type Ia supernova.', u'== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n"Introduction to Supernova Remnants".', u'NASA/GSFC.', u'2007-10-04.', u'Retrieved

Hart phrased it.', u'Roosevelt did so on the assurance from financial experts that Japan had been drained from the Russo-Japanese War and would not be ready for another conflict for at least a decade.', u'After the fleet had crossed the Pacific, Japanese statesmen realized that the balance of power in the East had changed since the Root\u2013Takahira Agreement that defined relevant spheres of interest of the United States and Japan.', u'The voyage also provided an opportunity to improve the sea- and battle-worthiness of the fleet.', u'While earlier capital ship classes such as the Kearsarge, Illinois and Maine were designed primarily for coastal defense, later classes such as the Virginia and Connecticut incorporated lessons learned from the Spanish\u2013American War and were conceived as ships with "the highest practicable speed and the greatest radius of action", in the words of the appropriation bills approved by the United States Congress for their construction.', u'They were intended as modern warships capable of long-range operations.', u'Nevertheless, the experience gained in the recent war with Spain had been limited.', u"== Concerns and preparations ==\nRoosevelt's stated intent was to give the navy practice in navigation, communication, coal consumption and fleet maneuvering; navy professionals maintained, however, that such matters could be served better in home waters.", u'In light of what had happened to the Russian Baltic Fleet, they were concerned about sending their own fleet on a long deployment, especially since part of the intent was to impress a modern, battle-tested navy that had not known defeat.', u'The fleet was untested in making such a voyage, and Tsushima had proven that extended deployments had no place in practical strategy.', u'The Japanese navy was close to coaling and repair facilities; while American ships could coal in the Philippines, docking facilities were far from optimal.', u'An extended stop on the West Coast of the United States during the voyage for overhaul and refurbishment in dry dock would be a necessity.', u'Planning for the voyage, however, showed a dearth of adequate facilities there, as well.', u'The main sea channel of the Mare Island Navy Yard near San Francisco was too shallow for battleships, which left only the Puget Sound Navy Yard in Bremerton, Washington for refit and repair.', u"The Hunter's Point civilian yard in San Francisco could accommodate capital ships but had been closed due to lack of use and was slated for demolition.", u"President Roosevelt ordered that Hunter's Point be reopened, facilities be brought up to date and the fleet to report there.", u'There was also the question of adequate resources for coaling.', u'This was not an issue when the Atlantic Fleet cruised the Atlantic or Caribbean, as fuel supplies were readily available.', u'However, the United States did not enjoy a worldwide network of coaling stations like that of Great Britain, nor did it have an adequate supply of auxiliary vessels for resupply.', u'During the Spanish\u2013American War, this lack had forced Admiral George Dewey to buy a collier-load of British coal in Hong Kong before the Battle of Manila Bay to ensure his squadron would not be stranded at sea.', u'The need had been even more pressing for the Russian Baltic Fleet during its long deployment during the Russo-Japanese War, not just for the distance it was to sail but also because, as a belligerent nation in wartime, most neutral ports were closed to it due to international law.', u'While the lack of support vessels was pointed out and a vigorous program of building such ships suggested by Rear Admiral George W. Melville, who had served as chief of the Bureau of Equipment, his words were not heeded adequately until World War II.', u'Federal regulations that restricted resupply vessels for Navy ships to those flying the United States flag, complicated by the lack of an adequate American merchant marine, proved another obstacle.', u'Roosevelt initially offered to award Navy supply contracts to American skippers whose bids exceeded those of foreign captains by less than 50 percent.', u'Many carriers declined this offer due to the fact that they could not obtain enough cargo to cover the cost of the return trip.', u'Two months before the fleet sailed, Roosevelt ordered the Navy Department to contract 38 ships to supply the fleet with the 125,000 tons of coal it would need to steam from Hampton Roads, Virginia to San Francisco.', u'Only eight of these were American-registered;

Burns, was involved in the Teapot Dome scandal.', u'When Hoover took over the Bureau of Investigation, it had approximately 650 employees, including 441 Special Agents.', u'Hoover was sometimes unpredictable in his leadership.', u'He frequently fired Bureau agents, singling out those he thought "looked stupid like truck drivers," or whom he considered "pinheads."', u'He also relocated agents who had displeased him to career-ending assignments and locations; Melvin Purvis was a prime example.', u'Purvis was one of the most effective agents in capturing and breaking up 1930s gangs, and it is alleged that Hoover maneuvered him out of the Bureau because Hoover was jealous of the substantial public recognition Purvis received.', u'Hoover often hailed local law-enforcement officers around the country, and built up a national network of supporters and admirers in the process.', u'One whom he often commended for particular effectiveness was the conservative sheriff of Caddo Parish, Louisiana, J. Howell Flournoy.', u'=== Gangster wars ===\n\nIn the early 1930s, criminal gangs carried out large numbers of bank robberies in the Midwest.', u'They used their superior firepower and fast getaway cars to elude local law enforcement agencies and avoid arrest.', u'Many of these criminals frequently made newspaper headlines across the United States, particularly John Dillinger, who became famous for leaping over bank cages, and repeatedly escaping from jails and police traps.', u'The gangsters enjoyed a level of sympathy in the Midwest, as banks and bankers were widely seen as oppressors of common people during the Great Depression.', u'The robbers operated across state lines, and Hoover pressed to have their crimes recognized as federal offenses so that he and his men would have the authority to pursue them and get the credit for capturing them.', u'Initially, the Bureau suffered some embarrassing foul-ups, in particular with Dillinger and his conspirators.', u'A raid on a summer lodge in Manitowish Waters, Wisconsin, called "Little Bohemia", left a Bureau agent and a civilian bystander dead and others wounded; all the gangsters escaped.', u'Hoover realized that his job was then on the line, and he pulled out all stops to capture the culprits.', u"In late July 1934, Special Agent Melvin Purvis, the Director of Operations in the Chicago office, received a tip on Dillinger's whereabouts that paid off when Dillinger was located, ambushed, and killed by Bureau agents outside the Biograph Theater.", u'In the same period, there were numerous Mafia shootings as a result of Prohibition, while Hoover continued to deny the very existence of organized crime.', u'Gangster Frank Costello helped encourage this view by feeding Hoover tips on sure winners through their mutual friend, gossip columnist Walter Winchell.', u'(Hoover had a reputation as "an inveterate horseplayer" known to send Special Agents to place $100 bets for him.)', u'Hoover said the Bureau had "much more important functions" than arresting bookmakers and gamblers.', u'Hoover was credited with several highly publicized captures or shootings of outlaws and bank robbers, even though he was not present at the events.', u"These included those of Machine Gun Kelly in 1933, of Dillinger in 1934, and of Alvin Karpis in 1936, which led to the Bureau's powers being broadened.", u'In 1935, the Bureau was renamed the Federal Bureau of Investigation.', u"In 1939, the FBI became pre-eminent in the field of domestic intelligence, thanks in large part to changes made by Hoover, such as expanding and combining fingerprint files in the Identification Division, to compile the largest collection of fingerprints to date, and Hoover's help to expand the FBI's recruitment and create the FBI Laboratory, a division established in 1932 to examine and analyze evidence found by the FBI.", u'=== Investigation of subversion and radicals ===\n\nHoover was concerned about what he claimed was subversion, and under his leadership, the FBI investigated tens of thousands of suspected subversives and radicals.', u'According to critics, Hoover tended to exaggerate the dangers of these alleged subversives and many times overstepped his bounds in his pursuit of eliminating that perceived threat.', u'William G. Hundley, a Justice Department prosecutor, said Hoover may have inadvertently kept alive the concern over communist infiltration into the government because Hoover\'s "informants were nearly the only ones that paid the party dues."', u'The FBI investigated rings of German saboteurs and spies starting in the late 1930s, and had primary responsibility for counterespionage.', u'The first arrests of German agents were made in 1938 and continued throughout World War II.', u'In the Quirin affair, during World War II, German U-boats set two small groups of Nazi agents ashore in Florida and Long Island to cause acts of sabotage within the country.', u'The two teams were apprehended after one of the men contacted the FBI and told them everything.', u'He was also charged and convicted.', u'During the war and for many years afterward, the FBI maintained a fictionalized version of the story in which it had preempted and caught the saboteurs solely by its own investigations and had even infiltrated the German government.', u'This story was useful during the war to discourage the Germans by making the FBI seem more invincible than it really was and perhaps afterward to similarly mislead the Soviets; but it also served Hoover in his efforts to maintain a superhero-style image for the FBI in American minds.', u'During this time period President Roosevelt, out of concern over Nazi agents in the United States, gave "qualified permission" to wiretap persons "suspected... [of] subversive activities".', u'He went on to add, in 1941, that the United States Attorney General had to be informed of its use in each case.', u'The Attorney General Robert H. Jackson left it to Hoover to decide how and when to use wiretaps, as he found the "whole business" distasteful.', u"Jackson's successor at the post of Attorney General, Francis Biddle, did turn down Hoover's requests on occasion.", u'The FBI participated in the Venona Project, a pre\u2013World War II joint project with the British to eavesdrop on Soviet spies in the UK and the United States.', u'They did not initially realize that espionage was being committed, but Soviet multiple use of one-time pad ciphers, which are normally unbreakable, created redundancies.', u'This let some intercepts be decoded, which established the espionage.', u"Hoover kept the intercepts\u2014America's greatest counterintelligence secret\u2014in a locked safe in his office, choosing not to inform President Truman, Attorney General J. Howard McGrath, or two Secretaries of State\u2014Dean Acheson and General George Marshall\u2014while they held office.", u'He informed the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the Venona Project in 1952.', u'In 1946, Attorney General Tom C. Clark authorized Hoover to compile a list of potentially disloyal Americans who might be detained during a wartime national emergency.', u'In 1950, at the outbreak of the Korean War, Hoover submitted to President Truman a plan to suspend the writ of habeas corpus and detain 12,000 Americans suspected of disloyalty.', u'Truman did not act on the plan.', u"=== COINTELPRO and the 1950s ===\n\nIn 1956, Hoover was becoming increasingly frustrated by U.S. Supreme Court decisions that limited the Justice Department's ability to prosecute people for their political opinions, most notably communists.", u'Some of his aides reported that he purposely exaggerated the threat of communism to "ensure financial and public support for the FBI."', u'At this time he formalized a covert "dirty tricks" program under the name COINTELPRO.', u'This program remained in place until it was revealed to the public in 1971, after the theft of many internal documents from an office in Media, Pennsylvania, and COINTELPRO became the cause of some of the harshest criticism of Hoover and the FBI.', u"COINTELPRO was first used to disrupt the Communist Party USA, where Hoover went after targets that ranged from suspected everyday spies to larger celebrity figures such as Charlie Chaplin, he saw as spreading Communist Party propaganda, and later organizations such as the Black Panther Party, Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and others.", u"COINTELPRO's methods included infiltration, burglaries, illegal wiretaps, planting forged documents, and spreading false rumors about key members of target organizations.", u'Some authors have charged that COINTELPRO methods also included inciting violence and arranging murders.', u'In 1975, COINTELPRO\'s activities were investigated by the United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, called the "Church Committee" after its chairman, Senator Frank Church (D-Idaho); the committee declared COINTELPRO\'s activities were illegal and contrary to the Constitution.', u'Hoover amassed significant power by collecting files containing large amounts of compromising and potentially embarrassing information on many powerful people, especially politicians.', u'According to Laurence Silberman, appointed Deputy Attorney General in early 1974, FBI Director Clarence M. Kelley thought such files either did not exist or had been destroyed.', u'After The Washington Post broke a story in January 1975, Kelley searched and found them in his outer office.', u'The House Judiciary Committee then demanded that Silberman testify about them.', u'In 1956, several years before he targeted King, Hoover had a public showdown with T. R. M. Howard, a civil rights leader from Mound Bayou, Mississippi.', u"During a national speaking tour, Howard had criticized the FBI's failure to thoroughly investigate the racially motivated murders of George W. Lee, Lamar Smith, and Emmett Till.", u'Hoover wrote an open letter to the press singling out these statements as "irresponsible".', u'=== Response to Mafia and civil rights groups ===\n\nWhile Hoover had fought bank-robbing gangsters in the 1930s, anti-communism was a bigger focus for him after World War II, as the Cold War developed.', u'During the 1940s through mid-1950s, he seemed to ignore organized crime of the type that ran vice rackets such as drugs, prostitution, and extortion.', u'He denied that any Mafia operated in the U.S.', u"In the 1950s, evidence of Hoover's unwillingness to focus FBI resources on the Mafia became grist for the media and his many detractors.", u'The Apalachin Meeting of late 1957 embarrassed the FBI by proving on newspaper front pages that a nationwide Mafia syndicate thrived unimpeded by the nation\'s "top cops".', u'Hoover immediately changed tack, and during the next five years, the FBI investigated organized crime heavily.', u'Its concentration on the topic fluctuated in subsequent decades, but it never again merely ignored this category of crime.', u"Hoover's moves against people who maintained contacts with subversive elements, some of whom were members of the civil rights movement, also led to accusations of trying to undermine their reputations.", u'The treatment of Martin Luther King, Jr. and actress Jean Seberg are two examples.', u"Jacqueline Kennedy recalled that Hoover told President John F. Kennedy that King tried to arrange a sex party while in the capital for the March on Washington and told Robert Kennedy that King made derogatory comments during the President's funeral.", u"However, King aide Andrew Young later claimed in a 2013 interview with the Academy of Achievement that the main source of tension between the SCLC and FBI was the government agency's lack of black agents and that both parties were willing to cooperate with each other by the time the Selma to Montgomery marches had taken place.", u'Hoover personally directed the FBI investigation of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.', u'In 1964, just days before Hoover testified in the earliest stages of the Warren Commission hearings, President Lyndon B. Johnson waived the then-mandatory U.S. Government Service Retirement Age of 70, allowing Hoover to remain the FBI Director "for an indefinite period of time."', u'The House Select Committee on Assassinations issued a report in 1979 critical of the performance by the FBI, the Warren Commission, and other agencies.', u"The report also criticized what it characterized as the FBI's reluctance to thoroughly investigate the possibility of a conspiracy to assassinate the President.", u'=== Late career ===\n\nPresidents Harry S Truman and John F. Kennedy each considered dismissing Hoover as FBI Director, but ultimately concluded that the political cost of doing so would be too great.', u"In 1964, Hoover's FBI investigated Jack Valenti, a special assistant and confidant of President Lyndon Johnson's.", u"Despite Valenti's two-year marriage to Johnson's personal secretary, the investigation focused on rumors that he was having a gay relationship with a commercial photographer friend.", u'When Richard Nixon took office in January 1969, Hoover had just turned 74.', u"There was a growing sentiment in Washington, DC that the aging FBI chief needed to go, but Hoover's power and friends in Congress remained too strong for him to be forced into retirement.", u'== Pets ==\nHoover received his first dog from his parents when he was a child, after which he was never without one.', u'He owned many throughout his lifetime and became an aficionado especially knowledgeable in fine breeding of pedigrees, particularly Cairn Terriers and Beagles.', u'He gave away many dogs to notable people, such as Presidents Herbert Hoover (no relation) and Lyndon B. Johnson, and buried seven canine pets, including a Cairn Terrier named Spee De Bozo, at Aspen Hill Memorial Park, in Silver Spring, Maryland.', u'== Death ==\nHoover remained director of the FBI until he died in his Washington home of a heart attack, on May 2, 1972.', u'His body lay in state in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol, where Chief Justice Warren Burger eulogized him.', u'President Richard Nixon delivered another eulogy at the funeral service in the National Presbyterian Church, and called Hoover "one of the giants[, whose] long life brimmed over with magnificent achievement and dedicated service to this country which he loved so well."', u'Hoover was buried in the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C., next to the graves of his parents and a sister who died in infancy.', u'== Successor ==\nOperational command of the Bureau passed to Associate Director Clyde Tolson.', u'On May 3, Nixon appointed L. Patrick Gray, a Justice Department official with no FBI experience, as Acting Director, with W. Mark Felt remaining as Associate Director.', u'== Legacy ==\nBiographer Kenneth D. Ackerman notes: "For better or worse, he built the FBI into a modern, national organization stressing professionalism and scientific crime-fighting.', u'For most of his life, Americans considered him a hero.', u'He made the G-Man brand so popular that, at its height, it was harder to become an FBI agent than to be accepted into an Ivy League college."', u"Hoover was a consultant to Warner Bros. for a theatrical film about the FBI, The FBI Story (1959), and in 1965 on Warner Bros.' long-running spin-off television series, The F.B.I.", u'Hoover personally made sure Warner Bros. portrayed the FBI more favorably than other crime dramas of the times.', u'In 1979, there was a large increase in conflict in the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) under Senator Richard Schweiker, which had re-opened the investigation of the assassination of President Kennedy and reported that Hoover\'s FBI "failed to investigate adequately the possibility of a conspiracy to assassinate the President".', u'The HSCA further reported that Hoover\'s FBI "was deficient in its sharing of information with other agencies and departments".', u"Because Hoover's actions came to be seen as abuses of power, FBI directors are now limited to one 10-year term, subject to extension by the United States Senate.", u'The FBI Headquarters in Washington, DC is named the J. Edgar Hoover Building, after Hoover.', u"Because of the controversial nature of Hoover's legacy, there have been periodic proposals to rename it by legislation proposed by both Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate.", u"For example, in 2001, Senator Harry Reid sponsored an amendment to strip Hoover's name from the building.", u'"J. Edgar Hoover\'s name on the FBI building is a stain on the building", Reid said.', u'The Senate did not adopt the amendment.', u"Hoover's practice of violating civil liberties for the sake of national security has been questioned in reference to recent national surveillance programs.", u'An example is a lecture titled "Civil Liberties and National Security: Did Hoover Get it Right?', u'", given at The Institute of World Politics on April 21, 2015.', u'== Sexuality ==\n\nSince the 1940s, rumors had circulated that Hoover was homosexual.', u"The historians John Stuart Cox and Athan G. Theoharis speculated that Clyde Tolson, who became an associate director of the FBI and Hoover's primary heir, may have been his lover.", u'Hoover reportedly hunted down and threatened anyone who made insinuations about his sexuality.', u'Some associates and scholars dismiss rumors about Hoover\'s sexuality, and his relationship with Tolson in particular, as unlikely, while others have described them as probable or even "confirmed".', u'Still other scholars have reported the rumors without expressing an opinion.', u'Hoover described Tolson as his alter ego: the men worked closely together during the day and, both single, frequently took meals, went to night clubs, and vacationed together.', u'This closeness between the two men is often cited as evidence that they were lovers, though some FBI employees who knew them, such as W. Mark Felt, say the relationship was "brotherly".', u"The former FBI official Mike Mason suggested that some of Hoover's colleagues denied that he had a sexual relationship with Tolson in an effort to protect Hoover's image.", u"Hoover bequeathed his estate to Tolson, who moved into Hoover's house after Hoover died.", u"Tolson accepted the American flag that draped Hoover's casket.", u'Tolson is buried a few yards away from Hoover in the Congressional Cemetery.', u"Hoover's biographer Richard Hack does not believe the director was gay.", u"Hack notes that Hoover was romantically linked to actress Dorothy Lamour in the late 1930s and early 1940s, and that after Hoover's death, Lamour did not deny rumors that she had had an affair with him in the years between her two marriages.", u'Hack further reported that, during the 1940s and 1950s, Hoover attended social events with Lela Rogers, the divorced mother of dancer and actress Ginger Rogers, so often that many of their mutual friends assumed the pair would eventually marry.', u'In his biography Official and Confidential: The Secret Life of J. Edgar Hoover (1993), the journalist Anthony Summers quoted "society divorcee" Susan Rosenstiel as claiming to have seen Hoover engaging in cross-dressing in the 1950s, at homosexual parties.', u'Summers also said the Mafia had blackmail material on Hoover, which made Hoover reluctant to pursue organized crime aggressively.', u"According to Summers, top organized crime figures Meyer Lansky and Frank Costello obtained photos of Hoover's alleged homosexual activity with Tolson and used them to ensure that the FBI did not target their illegal activities.", u'Additionally, Summers claimed that Hoover was friends with Billy Byars, Jr., an alleged child pornographer and producer of the film The Genesis Children.', u"Another Hoover biographer who heard the rumors of homosexuality and blackmail, however, said he was unable to corroborate them, though it has been acknowledged that Lansky and other organized crime figures had frequently been allowed to visit the Del Charro Hotel in La Jolla, California, which was owned by Hoover's friend, and staunch Lyndon Johnson supporter, Clint Murchison.", u'Hoover and Tolson would frequently visit the Del Charro Hotel as well.', u'Summers quoted a source named Charles Krebs as saying, "On three occasions that I knew about, maybe four, boys were driven down to La Jolla at Hoover\'s request."', u'Although never corroborated, the allegation of cross-dressing has been widely repeated.', u'In the words of author Thomas Doherty, "For American popular culture, the image of the zaftig FBI director as a Christine Jorgensen wanna-be was too delicious not to savor."', u'Biographer Kenneth Ackerman contends that Summers\' accusations have been "widely debunked by historians."', u"Skeptics of the cross-dressing story point to Susan Rosenstiel's poor credibility (she pleaded guilty to attempted perjury in a 1971 case and later served time in a New York City jail).", u'Recklessly indiscreet behavior by Hoover would have been totally out of character, whatever his sexuality.', u"Most biographers consider the story of Mafia blackmail unlikely in light of the FBI's investigations of the Mafia.", u'Truman Capote, who helped spread salacious rumors about Hoover, once remarked that he was more interested in making Hoover angry than determining whether the rumors were true.', u"The attorney Roy Cohn, who served as general counsel on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations during Senator Joseph McCarthy's tenure as chairman and assisted Hoover during the 1950s investigations of Communists\u2014and who was generally known to be a closeted homosexual\u2014opined that Hoover was too frightened of his own sexuality to have anything approaching a normal sexual or romantic relationship.", u'During the Lavender Scare, Cohn and McCarthy further enhanced anti-Communist fervor by suggesting that Communists overseas had convinced several closeted homosexuals within the U.S. government to leak important government information in exchange for the assurance that their sexual identity would remain a secret.', u'A federal investigation that followed convinced President Dwight D. Eisenhower to sign an Executive Order on April 29, 1953, that barred homosexuals from obtaining jobs at the federal level.', u'In his 2004 study of the event, historian David K. Johnson attacked the speculations about Hoover\'s homosexuality as relying on "the kind of tactics Hoover and the security program he oversaw perfected\u2014guilt by association, rumor, and unverified gossip."', u'He views Rosenstiel as a liar who was paid for her story, whose "description of Hoover in drag engaging in sex with young blond boys in leather while desecrating the Bible is clearly a homophobic fantasy."', u'He believes only those who have forgotten the virulence of the decades-long campaign against homosexuals in government can believe reports that Hoover appeared in compromising situations.', u'Some people associated with Hoover have supported the rumors about his homosexual tendencies.', u'Actress and singer Ethel Merman, who was a friend of Hoover\'s since 1938, said in a 1978 interview, "Some of my best friends are homosexual.', u'Everybody knew about J. Edgar Hoover, but he was the best chief the FBI ever had."', u"According to Anthony Summers, Hoover often frequented New York City's Stork Club.", u'Luisa Stuart, a model who was 18 or 19 at the time, told Summers that she had seen Hoover holding hands with Tolson as they all rode in a limo uptown to the Cotton Club in 1936.', u"The novelist William Styron told Summers that he once saw Hoover and Tolson in a California beach house, where the director was painting his friend's toenails.", u'Harry Hay, founder of the Mattachine Society, one of the first gay rights organizations, said Hoover and Tolson sat in boxes owned by and used exclusively by gay men at the Del Mar racetrack in California.', u'One medical expert told Summers that Hoover was of "strongly predominant homosexual orientation," while another medical expert categorized him as a "bisexual with failed heterosexuality."', u'Cox and Theoraris also alleged that "the strange likelihood is that Hoover never knew sexual desire at all."', u'== Honors ==\n1938: Oklahoma Baptist University awarded Hoover an honorary doctorate during commencement exercises, at which he spoke.', u'1939: the National Academy of Sciences awarded Hoover its Public Welfare Medal.', u'1950: King George VI of the United Kingdom awarded Hoover an honorary knighthood in the Order of the British Empire.', u'1955: President Dwight Eisenhower gave Hoover the National Security Medal.', u"1966: President Lyndon B.

husband's aunts to refuse to even acknowledge du Barry, but some saw this as a political blunder that jeopardised Austria's interests at the French court.", u"However, Marie Antoinette's mother and the Austrian ambassador to France, comte de Mercy-Argenteau who was sending the Empress secret reports on Marie-Antoinette's behavior, put Marie Antoinette under pressure and she grudgingly agreed to speak to Madame du Barry on New Year's Day 1772.", u'She only said "there are a lot of people at Versailles today", but Madame du Barry was satisfied by this victory and the crisis passed.', u'Two days after the death of Louis XV in 1774, Louis XVI exiled Madame du Barry to the Abbaye de Pont-aux-Dames in Meaux, pleasing his wife and aunts.', u"Two and a half years later, at the end of October 1776, Madame du Barry's exile ended and she was allowed to return to her beloved chateau at Louveciennes, but she was never permitted to return to Versailles.", u'== Queen of France (1774\u201391) ==\n\n\n=== Early years (1774\u201378) ===\nUpon the death of Louis XV on 10 May 1774, the Dauphin ascended the throne as King Louis XVI of France and Navarre, and Marie Antoinette became Queen of France and Navarre.', u'At the outset, the new queen had limited political influence with her husband, who with the support of his two most important ministers, Chief Minister Maurepas and Foreign Minister Vergennes, blocked several of her candidates from taking important positions, including Choiseul,.', u"However, the queen did play a decisive role in the disgrace and exile of the most powerful of Louis XV's ministers, the Duke of Aiguillon.", u'On 24 May 1774, two weeks after the death of Louis XV, her husband gave her an estate, the Petit Trianon, and free rein to renovate it; soon rumours circulated that she plastered the walls with gold and diamonds.', u'The queen spent heavily on fashion, luxuries and gambling, though the country was facing a grave financial crisis and the population suffering.', u'For her, Rose Bertin created dresses, hair styles such as poufs up to three feet (90 cm) high and the panache (bundle of feathers).', u'She and her court also adopted the English fashion of dresses made of indienne (a material banned in France from 1686 until 1759), percale and muslin.', u'By the time of the Flour War of 1775, a series of riots against the high price of flour and bread, her reputation among the general public was no better than that of the favourites of the previous kings.', u'As early as 1774, Marie Antoinette began to befriend a few male admirers, such as the baron de Besenval, the duc de Coigny, and the Count Valentin Esterh\xe1zy., and formed deep friendships with various ladies at court.', u'Most noted was Marie-Louise, princesse de Lamballe, related to the royal family through her marriage into the Penthi\xe8vre family.', u'On 19 September 1774, she appointed her Superintendent of her Household, a charge she soon gave to her new favourite, the duchesse de Polignac.', u'In 1774, she took under her patronage her former music teacher, the German composer of operas Christoph Willibald Gluck, who remained in France until 1779.', u'=== Motherhood, changes at court, intervention in politics (1778\u201381) ===\n\nAmidst the atmosphere of a wave of libelles, the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph came to France incognito, under the name comte de Falkenstein, for a six-week visit during which he toured Paris extensively and was a guest at Versailles.', u"He met his sister and her husband on 18 April 1777 at the ch\xe2teau de la Muette, and spoke frankly to his brother-in-law, curious as to why the royal marriage had not been consummated, arriving at the conclusion that no obstacle to the couple's conjugal relations existed, save the queen's lack of interest and the king's unwillingness to exert himself in that arena.", u'In a letter to his brother Leopold, Joseph graphically described them as "a couple of complete blunderers."', u"Due to Joseph's intervention, the marriage was finally consummated in August 1777.", u'Eight months later, in April 1778, it was suspected that the queen was pregnant, which was officially announced on May 16.', u"Marie Antoinette's daughter, Marie-Th\xe9r\xe8se Charlotte, Madame Royale, was born at Versailles on 19 December 1778.", u"The child's paternity was contested in the libelles.", u"In the middle of the queen's pregnancy, two events occurred which had profound impact on her later life: the return of Count Axel von Fersen to Versailles for two years, and her brother's claims on the throne of Bavaria.", u'Marie Antoinette pleaded with her husband for the French to intercede on behalf of Austria.', u"The Peace of Teschen, signed on 13 May 1779, ended the brief conflict, with the queen imposing French mediation on the demand of her mother, and Austria's gaining a territory of at least 100,000 inhabitants - a strong retreat from the early French position which was hostile towards Austria with the impression, partially justified, that the queen sided with Austria against France .", u'Meanwhile, the queen began to institute changes in the customs practiced at court.', u'Some changes were met with disapproval from the older generation, such as the abandonment of heavy make-up and the popular wide-hooped panniers.', u'The new fashion called for a more simple feminine look, typified first by the rustic robe \xe0 la polonaise and later by the gaulle, a simple muslin dress Marie Antoinette wore in a 1783 Vig\xe9e-Le Brun portrait.', u'She also began to participate in amateur plays and musicals, starting in 1780, in a theatre built for her by Mique at the Petit Trianon.', u"Repayment of the French debt remained a difficult problem, further exacerbated by Vergennes and also Marie Antoinette's prodding Louis XVI to involve France in Great Britain's war with its North American colonies: the queen played a very important role in supporting the American Revolution by securing Austrian and Russian support for France which resulted in the establishment of a neutral league that stopped Great Britain's attack, and by weighing in decisively for the nomination of Philippe Henri, marquis de S\xe9gur, as Minister of War and Charles Eug\xe8ne Gabriel de La Croix, marquis de Castries, Secretary of the Navy in 1780, who helped George Washington in defeating the British in the American Revolutionary War, which ended in 1783.", u'In 1783, the queen played a decisive role in the nomination of Charles Alexandre de Calonne, a close friend of the Polignacs, as Controller-General of Finances, and of the baron de Breteuil as the Minister for the Maison du Roi (Minister of the Royal Household), making him perhaps the strongest and most conservative minister of the reign.', u"The result of these two nominations was that Marie Antoinette's influence became paramount in government, and the new ministers rejected any major change to the structure of the old regime.", u'More than that, the decree by de S\xe9gur, the minister of war, requiring four quarterings of nobility as a condition for the appointment of officers, blocked the access of commoners to important positions in the armed forces, posing the concept of equality one of the main grievances and causes of the French Revolution.', u"Marie Antoinette's second pregnancy ended in a miscarriage early in July 1779, as confirmed by letters between the queen and her mother, although some historians believed that she may have experienced bleeding related to an irregular menstrual cycle, which she mistook for a lost pregnancy.", u'Her third pregnancy was affirmed in March 1781, and on 22 October she gave birth to Louis Joseph Xavier Fran\xe7ois, Dauphin of France.', u'Empress Maria Theresa died on 29 November 1780, in Vienna.', u'Marie Antoinette feared that the death of her mother would jeopardise the Franco-Austrian alliance (as well as, ultimately, herself), but her brother, Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, wrote to her that he had no intention of breaking the alliance.', u'A second visit from Joseph II, which had taken place in July 1781, to reaffirm the Franco-Austrian alliance and also to see his sister again, was tainted with rumours that Marie Antoinette was sending money from the French treasury to him.', u"=== Declining popularity (1782\u201385) ===\n\nDespite the general celebration over the birth of the Dauphin, Marie Antoinette's political influence, such as it was, did greatly benefit Austria.", u'During the Kettle War, in which her brother Joseph attempted to open the Scheldt River for naval passage; Marie Antoinette succeeded in obliging Vergennes to pay a huge financial compensation to Austria.', u"Finally, the queen was able to obtain her brother's support against Great Britain in the American Revolution and she neutralized French hostility to his alliance with Russia.", u'In 1782, after the governess of the Enfants de France, the princesse de Gu\xe9m\xe9n\xe9, went bankrupt and resigned, Marie Antoinette appointed her favourite, the duchesse de Polignac, to the position.', u'This decision met with disapproval from the court, as the duchess was considered to be of too modest a birth to occupy such an exalted position.', u'On the other hand, both the king and the queen trusted Mme de Polignac completely, gave her a thirteen-room apartment in Versailles and paid her well.', u"The entire Polignac family benefited greatly from the royal favour in titles and positions, but its sudden wealth and lavish lifestyle outraged most aristocratic families who resented the Polignacs' dominance at court, and also fueled the increasing popular disapprobation toward Marie Antoinette, mostly in Paris.", u'Mercy wrote to the Empress:"It is almost unexampled that in so short a time, the royal favour should have brought such overwhelming advantages to a family".', u"In June 1783, Marie Antoinette's new pregnancy was announced; however, on the night of 1\u20132 November, her 28th birthday, she suffered a miscarriage.", u"Count Axel von Fersen, after his return from America in June 1783, was accepted into the queen's private society.", u'There were and still are claims that the two were romantically involved, but since most of the correspondence between the two has been either lost or destroyed, there is no conclusive evidence of this.', u'In 1783, the queen was busy with the creation of her "hamlet", a rustic retreat built by her favoured architect, Richard Mique, according to the designs of the painter Hubert Robert.', u'Its creation, however, caused another uproar when its cost became widely known.', u'Around this time, she accumulated a library of 5000 books.', u'Those on music, often dedicated to her, were the most read, though she also liked to read history.', u'She sponsored the arts, in particular music, and also supported some scientific endeavours, encouraging and witnessing the first launch of a hot air balloon (Montgolfi\xe8re).', u"On 27 April 1784, Beaumarchais's play The Marriage of Figaro premiered in Paris.", u"After initially having been banned by the king due to its negative portrayal of the nobility, the play was finally allowed to be publicly performed because of the queen's support and its overwhelming popularity at court, where secret readings of it had been given by Marie Antoinette.", u'The play was a disaster for the image of the monarchy and aristocracy.', u"It did inspire Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro, which premiered in Vienna on 1 May 1786.", u"On 24 October 1784, putting the baron de Breteuil in charge of its acquisition, Louis XVI bought the Ch\xe2teau de Saint-Cloud from the duc d'Orl\xe9ans, in the name of his wife.", u'This was unpopular, particularly with some factions of the nobility who disliked the queen, but also with a growing percentage of the population who disapproved of a Queen of France owning her private residence independently of the king; thus, the purchase of Saint-Cloud contributed to damage the image of the queen even further in the public opinion.', u"The ch\xe2teau's expensive price, almost 6 million livres, plus the substantial extra cost of redecorating it, ensured that there was much less money going towards repaying France's substantial debt.", u'=== Prelude to the Revolution: Scandals and the failure of Reforms (1786\u201389) ===\nOn 27 March 1785, Marie Antoinette gave birth to a second son, Louis Charles, who bore the title of Duke of Normandy.', u"The fact that the birth occurred exactly nine months after Fersen's return did not escape the attention of many, leading to doubt as to the parentage of the child, and to a noticeable decline of the queen's reputation in public opinion.", u"However, the majority of Marie-Antoinette's and Louis XVII's biographers believe that the young prince was the biological son of Louis XVI, even Stefan Zweig and Antonia Fraser, who believe that Fersen and Marie Antoinette were romantically involved.", u"Courtiers at Versailles noted in their diaries that the date of the child's conception in fact corresponded perfectly with a period when the king and the queen had spent a lot of time together, but these details were ignored amid attacks on the queen's character.", u'These suspicions of illegitimacy, along with the continued publication of the libelles, and never-ending cavalcades of court intrigues, the actions of Joseph II in the Kettle War, the purchase of Saint-Cloud and the Diamond Necklace scandal combined to turn popular opinion sharply against the queen, and the image of a licentious, spendthrift, empty-headed foreign queen was quickly taking root in the French psyche.', u'A second daughter, and her last child, Marie Sophie H\xe9l\xe8ne B\xe9atrix, Madame Sophie, was born on 9 July 1786, and lived only eleven months, to 19 June 1787.', u'=== Issue ===\nMarie-Th\xe9r\xe8se-Charlotte, Madame Royale (19 December 1778 \u2013 19 October 1851)\nLouis-Joseph-Xavier-Fran\xe7ois, Dauphin (22 October 1781 \u2013 4 June 1789)\nLouis-Charles, Dauphin after the death of his elder brother, future titular king Louis XVII of France (27 March 1785 \u2013 8 June 1795)\nSophie-H\xe9l\xe8ne-B\xe9atrix, died in infancy (9 July 1786 \u2013 19 June 1787)\n\n\n==== The diamond necklace scandal ====\n\nMarie-Antoinette began to abandon her more carefree activities to become increasingly involved in politics in her role as "Queen of France".', u'By showing to the public her attention to the education and care of her children, the queen sought to improve the dissolute image she had acquired in 1785 from the "Diamond Necklace Affair", in which public opinion had falsely accused her of criminal participation in defrauding the jewelers Boehmer and Bassenge of the cost of a very expensive diamond necklace they had created originally for Madame du Barry.', u'The main actors of the scandal were the Cardinal de Rohan, prince de Rohan-Gu\xe9m\xe9n\xe9, Great Almoner of France, and Jeanne de Valois-Saint-R\xe9my, comtesse de La Motte, a descendant of an illegitimate child of Henry II of France of the House of Valois.', u'Marie Antoinette had a profound dislike for Rohan since the time he had been the French ambassador to Vienna when she was a child.', u'Despite his high clerical position at the Court, she never addressed a word to him.', u"Others involved were Nicole Legay, alias baronne d'Oliva, a prostitute who happened to be a lookalike of Marie Antoinette, R\xe9taux de Villette, a forger, Alessandro Cagliostro, an Italian adventurer, and the comte de La Motte, Jeanne de Valois' husband.", u'Mme de La Motte tricked Rohan into buying the necklace as a gift to Marie-Antoinette, in order for him to get into the favors of the queen.', u'When the affair was discovered, those involved (except de La Motte and R\xe9aux de Villette who managed to flee) were arrested, tried, convicted and either imprisoned or exiled.', u'The only one imprisoned was Mme de La Motte, who was given a life sentence to Piti\xe9-Salp\xeatri\xe8re Hospital, which also served as a prison for women.', u'Judged by the Parlement, Rohan was found innocent of any wrongdoing (which he was), and allowed to leave the Bastille.', u'Marie Antoinette, who had insisted on the arrest of the Cardinal was dealt a heavy personal blow, as was the monarchy, and despite the fact that the guilty parties were tried and convicted, the affair proved to be extremely damaging to her reputation, which never recovered from it.', u'==== Failure of political and financial reforms ====\nSuffering from an acute case of depression, the king began to seek the advice of his wife.', u'In her new role and with increasing degree of power as a politically viable entity, the queen tried to help the situation brewing between the assembly and the king.', u"This change of the queen's political position signalled the end of the Polignacs' influence and their impact on the finances of the Crown.", u'Continuing deterioration of the financial situation, despite cutbacks to the royal retinue and court expenses, ultimately forced the king, the queen and the Minister of Finance, Calonne, at the urging of Vergennes, to call the Assembly of Notables, after a hiatus of 160 years.', u'The assembly was held to attempt passing necessary financial reforms, but the Parlements refused to cooperate.', u'The first meeting took place on 22 February 1787, (nine days after the death of Vergennes on 13 February).', u'Marie Antoinette did not attend the meeting and her absence resulted in accusations that the queen was trying to undermine its purpose.', u'The Assembly was a failure: it did not pass any reforms and, instead, fell into the pattern of defying the king.', u'On the urging of the queen, Louis XVI dismissed Calonne on 8 April 1787.', u"On 1 May 1787, \xc9tienne Charles de Lom\xe9nie de Brienne, the archbishop of Toulouse and one of the queen's political allies, was appointed by the king, on Marie Antoinette's urging, to replace Calonne, first as the Controller-General of Finances and then as Prime Minister.", u'He began to institute more cutbacks at court, while trying to restore the royal absolute power weakened by parliaments.', u"Brienne, though, was not able to improve the financial situation, and since he was the queen's ally, this failure adversely affected her political position.", u'The continued poor financial climate of the country resulted in the 25 May dissolution of the Assembly of Notables because of its inability to get things done, and the lack of solutions was blamed on the queen.', u"France's financial problems were the result of a combination of factors: several expensive wars; a large royal family whose expenditures were paid for by the state; and an unwillingness on the part of most members of the privileged classes, aristocracy and clergy, to help defray the costs of the government out of their own pockets by relinquishing some of their financial privileges.", u'As a result of the public perception that she had single-handedly ruined the national finances, Marie Antoinette was given the nickname of "Madame D\xe9ficit" in the summer of 1787.', u'While sole fault for the financial crisis did not lie with her, Marie Antoinette was the biggest obstacle to any major reform effort.', u'She had played a decisive role in the disgrace of the reformer Ministers of Finance, Turgot (in 1776), and Jacques Necker (first dismissal in 1781).', u'If the secret expenses of the queen were taken into account, the expense of the court was much higher than the official estimate of 7% of the state budget.', u'The queen attempted to fight back with propaganda portraying her as a caring mother, most notably in the painting by \xc9lisabeth Vig\xe9e Le Brun exhibited at the Royal Acad\xe9mie Salon de Paris in August 1787, showing her with her children.', u'Around the same time, Jeanne de Valois-Saint-R\xe9my escaped from prison and fled to London, where she published damaging slander concerning her supposed amorous affair with the queen.', u"The political situation in 1787 worsened when, on Marie Antoinette's urging, on 15 August the Parlement was exiled in Troyes.", u'It further deteriorated when Louis XVI tried to use a lit de justice on 11 November to impose legislation.', u"The new duc d'Orl\xe9ans publicly protested the king's actions, and was subsequently exiled to his estate at Villers-Cotter\xeats.", u'The May Edicts issued on 8 May 1788 were also opposed by the public and parliaments.', u'Finally, on 8 August, Louis XVI announced his intention to bring back the Estates General, the traditional elected legislature of the country, which had not been convened since 1614.', u"While from late 1787 up to his death in June 1789, Marie-Antoinette's primary concern was the continued deterioration of the health of the Dauphin, who suffered from tuberculosis, she was directly involved with the exile of the Parlement, the May Edicts and the announcement regarding the Estates General; she did participate in the King Council, the first queen to do this in over 175 years (since Marie de' Medici had been named Chef du Conseil du Roi, between 1614 and 1617), and she was making the major decisions behind the scene and in the King Council.", u"Marie Antoinette was instrumental in the recall of Jacques Necker as Finance Minister on 26 August, a popular move, even though she herself was worried that the recall would again go against her if Necker proved unsuccessful in reforming the country's finances, and she accepted Necker's proposition to double the representation of the Tiers \xc9tat in an attempt to check the power of the aristocracy\nOn the eve of the opening of the Estates General, the queen attended the mass celebrating its return.", u"From time of its very opening on 5 May 1789, the fracture between the democratic Third Estate (consisting of bourgeois and radical aristocrats), and the conservative nobility of the Second Estate widened, and Marie Antoinette knew that her rival, the duc d'Orl\xe9ans, who had given money and bread to the people during the winter, would be acclaimed by the crowd, much to her detriment.", u'The death of the Dauphin on 4 June, which deeply affected his parents, was virtually ignored by the French people, who were instead preparing for the next meeting of the Estates General and hoping for a resolution to the bread crisis.', u'As the Third Estate declared itself a National Assembly and took the Tennis Court Oath, and as people either spread or believed rumors that the queen wished to bathe in their blood, Marie Antoinette went into mourning for her eldest son.', u'Her role was decisive in urging the king to remain firm and to not concede to popular demands for reforms.', u'In addition, she was showing her determination to use force to crush the forthcoming revolution.', u'== The French Revolution before Varennes (1789\u201391) ==\n\nThe situation escalated on 20 June as the Third Estate, which had been joined by several members of the clergy and radical nobility, found the door to its appointed meeting place closed by order of the king.', u'It thus met at the tennis court in Versailles and took the Tennis Court Oath not to separate before it had given a constitution to the nation.', u"On 11 July, on Marie Antoinette's urging, Necker was dismissed to be replaced by Breteuil, the queen's choice to crush the Revolution with mercenary Swiss troops under the command of one of her favorites, Pierre Victor, baron de Besenval de Br\xfcnstatt.", u'At the news, Paris was besieged by riots which culminated in the storming of the Bastille on 14 July, and on 15 July Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette was named commander-in-chief of the newly formed Garde nationale.', u"In the days following the storming of the Bastille, for fear of assassination, and ordered by the king, the emigration of members of the high aristocracy began, with the departure of the comte d'Artois, the Cond\xe9s, cousins of the king, and the unpopular Polignacs on 17 July.", u'Marie Antoinette, whose life was as much in danger, remained by the king whose power was gradually being taken away by the National Constituent Assembly.', u"The abolition of feudal privileges by the National Constituent Assembly on 4 August 1789, and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (La D\xe9claration des Droits de l'Homme et du Citoyen), drafted by La Fayette with the help of Thomas Jefferson, and adopted on 26 August, led the way to the Constitutional Monarchy (4 September 1791 \u2013 21 September 1792).", u'Despite these dramatic changes, life at court continued, while the situation in Paris was becoming critical because of bread shortages in September.', u"On 5 October, a crowd from Paris descended upon Versailles and forced the royal family to move to the Tuileries Palace in Paris, where they lived under a form of house arrest under the watch of La Fayette's Garde nationale, while the comte de Provence and his wife were allowed to reside in the Petit Luxembourg, where they remained until going into exile on 20 June 1791.", u'Marie Antoinette continued performing charitable functions, attending religious ceremonies, but mostly dedicated her time to her children.', u'She also played an important political, albeit not public, role between 1789 and 1791, in which time she had a complex set of relationships with several key actors of the early period of the French Revolution.', u'One of the most important was Necker, the "Prime Minister of Finances" (Premier ministre des finances).', u'Despite her dislike of him, she played a decisive role in his return to office; however, she blamed him for his supporting the Revolution, and did not regret his resignation in 1790.', u'La Fayette, one of the former military leaders in the American War of Independence (1775\u201383), served as the warden of the royal family in his position as commander-in-chief of the Garde nationale.', u'Despite his dislike of the queen - he detested her as much as she detested him and, at one time, had even threatened sending her to a convent - he was persuaded by the mayor of Paris, Jean Sylvain Bailly, to work in collaboration with her, and even allowed her to see Fersen a number of times.', u'He even went as far as exiling the Duke of Orl\xe9ans, who was accused by the queen of fomenting trouble.', u'His relation with the king was more cordial: being a liberal aristocrat, he did not want the fall of the monarchy but the establishment of a liberal one, similar to that of the United Kingdom, based on collaboration between the king and the people, as was to be defined in the Constitution of 1791.', u'Despite her attempts to remain out of the public eye, Marie Antoinette was falsely accused in the libelles of conducting an affair with La Fayette, whom she loathed, and, as was published in "Le Godmich\xe9 Royal" (translated, "The Royal Dildo"), on having a sexual relationship with the English Baroness \'Lady Sophie Farrell\' of Bournemouth, a well-known lesbian of the time.', u'Publication of such calumnies continued to the end, climaxing at her trial with that of incest with her son.', u'There is no evidence to support the accusations.', u'=== Mirabeau ===\nA significant achievement for Marie Antoinette in that period was the establishment of an alliance with Honor\xe9 Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau, the most important lawmaker in the assembly.', u'Like La Fayette, Mirabeau was a liberal aristocrat.', u'He had joined the tiers \xe9tat, and was not against the monarchy, but wanted to reconcile the monarchy with the Revolution.', u'He also wanted to be a minister and was not immune to corruption.', u'On the advice of Mercy, Marie Antoinette opened secret negotiations with him and both agreed to meet in secret at the ch\xe2teau of Saint-Cloud on 3 July 1790, where the royal family was allowed to spend the summer, free of the radical elements who watched their every move in Paris.', u'At the meeting, Mirabeau was much impressed by the queen, and remarked in a letter to the comte de La Marck that she was the only man the king had by him: La reine est le seul homme que le roi ait aupr\xe8s de lui.', u"A deal was reached turning Mirabeau into one of her political allies: Marie Antoinette promised to pay him 6000 livres per month and one million if he succeeded in his mission to restore the king's authority.", u'The only time the royal couple returned to Paris in that period was on 14 July, to attend the F\xeate de la F\xe9d\xe9ration, the official ceremony held at the Champ de Mars in commemoration of the fall of the Bastille one year earlier.', u'At least 300,000 persons participated from all over France including 18,000 national guards, with Talleyrand, bishop of Autun, celebrating a mass at the autel de la patrie ("altar of the fatherland").', u'At the event, the king was greeted with loud cheers of "Long Live The King ", especially when he took the oath to protect the Nation and to enforce the laws voted by the Constitutional Assembly.', u'There were even cheers to the queen, particularly when she presented the Dauphin to the public.', u"Mirabeau sincerely wanted to reconcile the queen with the people, and she was happy to see him restoring much of the king's powers, such as his authority over foreign policy, and the right to declare war.", u'Over the objections of La Fayette and his allies, the king was given a suspensive veto allowing him to veto any laws for a period of four years.', u'With time, Mirabeau would support the queen even more, going as far as to suggest Louis XVI "adjourn" to Rouen or Compi\xe8gne.', u'However, this leverage with the Assembly ended with the death of Mirabeau in April 1791, despite the attempt of several moderate leaders of the Revolution to contact the queen to establish some kind of cooperation with her.', u"=== Civil Constitution of the Clergy ===\nIn March 1791, Pope Pius VI had condemned the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, reluctantly signed by Louis XVI, which reduced the number of bishops from 132 to 93, imposed the election of bishops and all members of the clergy by departmental or district assemblies of electors, and finally reduced the Pope's authority over the Church.", u'Religion played an important role in the life of Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI, both raised in the Roman Catholic faith.', u"The queen's political ideas and her belief in the absolute power of monarchs were based on France's monarchy long established on the divine right of kings.", u"On 18 April, as the royal family was ready to leave for Saint-Cloud to attend Easter mass celebrated by a refractory priest, a crowd, soon joined by the Garde nationale (disobeying La Fayette's orders), kept it from leaving Paris, and prompting Marie Antoinette to declare to La Fayette that she and her family were no longer free.", u"This incident fortified her in her determination to leave Paris; however, both for affective and political reasons, not alone, but with her family, and even the king, who had been hesitant, accepted his wife's decision to flee with the help of foreign powers and counter revolutionary forces.", u'Fersen and Breteuil (who represented her in the courts of Europe) were put in charge of the escape plan, while Marie Antoinette continued her negotiations with some moderate leaders of the French Revolution.', u"== Flight, arrest at Varennes and return to Paris (21\u201325 June 1791) ==\n\nThere had been several plots designed to help the royal family escape, which the queen had rejected because she would not leave without the king, or which had ceased to be viable because of the king's indecision.", u'Once Louis XVI finally did commit to a plan, its poor execution was the cause of its failure.', u'In an elaborate attempt, known as the Flight to Varennes, to reach the royalist stronghold of Montm\xe9dy, some members of the royal family were to pose as the servants of (the imaginary) Mme de Korff, a wealthy Russian baroness, in the role held by Louise-\xc9lisabeth de Cro\xff de Tourzel, governess of the royal children.', u'After many delays, the escape ultimately occurred on 21 June 1791, but the entire family was arrested twenty-four hours later at Varennes and taken back to Paris within a week.', u'The escape attempt destroyed much of the remaining support of the population for the king\nUpon learning of the capture of the royal family, the National Constituent Assembly sent three representatives, Antoine Barnave, J\xe9r\xf4me P\xe9tion de Villeneuve and Charles C\xe9sar de Fay de La Tour-Maubourg to Varennes to escort Marie Antoinette and her family back to Paris, where they were jeered and insulted by the people as never before.', u'The prestige of the French monarchy had never been at such a low level.', u'During the trip, Barnave, the representative of the moderate party in the Assembly, protected Marie Antoinette from the crowds, and even P\xe9tion took pity on the royal family.', u'Brought safely back to Paris, they were met with total silence from the crowd.', u'Thanks to Barnave, the royal couple was not brought to trial and was publicly exonerated of any crime in relation with the attempted escape.', u'During the night of 21\u201322 June, the queen\'s hair had, according to Mme Campan, Marie Antoinette\'s first lady-of-the-bedchamber, "in one night it turned white as those of a seventy-year old woman."', u"(En une seule nuit ils \xe9taient devenus blancs comme ceux d'une femme de soixante-dix ans.)", u'== Radicalization of the Revolution after Varennes (1791\u201392) ==\n\nAfter their return from Varennes, and until the storming of the Tuileries on 10 August 1792, the queen, her family and entourage were held by the Garde nationale under tight surveillance within the Tuileries, where the royal couple was guarded night and day.', u'Four guards accompanied her wherever she went, and her bedroom door had to be left open at night.', u'Her health also began to deteriorate, thus further reducing her physical activities.', u"On 17 July 1791, with the support of Barnave and his friends, La Fayette's Garde nationale opened fire on the crowd who had assembled on the Champ de Mars to sign a petition demanding the deposition of the king.", u'The estimated number of those killed varies between 12 and 50.', u"La Fayette's reputation never recovered from the event and, on 8 October, he resigned as commander of the Garde nationale.", u'Always refusing his help, Marie Antoinette played a decisive role in defeating him in his aims to become the mayor of Paris in November 1791.', u'As her correspondence shows, while Barnave was taking great political risks with the belief the queen was his political ally, and had managed, despite her unpopularity, to secure a moderate majority ready to work with her, Marie Antoinette was not sincere in her cooperation with the moderate leaders of the French Revolution, which ultimately ended any chance to establish a moderate government.', u"Moreover, the view that the unpopular queen was controlling the king further degraded the royal couple's standing with the people, which the Jacobins successfully exploited after their return from Varennes to advance their radical agenda to abolish the monarchy.", u'This situation lasted until the spring of 1792.', u'Marie Antoinette kept hoping that the military coalition of the European kingdoms would succeed in crushing the Revolution.', u'She counted mostly on the support of her Austrian family.', u'After the death of her brother Joseph in 1790, his successor, Leopold was willing to support her, but only to a limited degree.', u"However, upon Leopold's death in 1792, his son, Francis, a conservative ruler, was ready to support the cause of the French royal couple because he feared the consequences of the French Revolution and its ideas on the monarchies of Europe and, more particularly, on Austria's influence in the continent.", u'Barnave had advised the queen to call back Mercy, who had played such an important role in her life before the Revolution, but Mercy had been appointed to another foreign diplomatic position and could not return to France.', u'At the end of 1791, ignoring the danger she faced, the princesse de Lamballe, who was in London, returned to the Tuileries.', u'As for Fersen, in February 1792, despite the strong restriction imposed on her, he was able to see the queen a final time.', u"== Events leading to the abolition of the monarchy on 10 August 1792 - Temple ==\n\nLeopold's and Francis II's aggressive actions on Marie Antoinette's behalf led to France's declaration of war on Austria on 20 April 1792.", u'This resulted in the queen being viewed as an enemy, even though she was against Austrian claims to French territories on European soil.', u'That summer, the situation was compounded by multiple defeats of the French armies by the Austrians, in part because of Marie Antoinette passed military secrets to Austria.', u'In addition, at the insistence of his wife, Louis XVI vetoed several measures that would have further restricted his power, earning the royal couple the nicknames "Monsieur Veto" and "Madame Veto".', u'nicknames then prominently featured in different contexts, including La Carmagnole.', u'Barnave remained the most important advisor and supporter of the queen, who was willing to work with him as long as he followed her demands, which he did to a large extent.', u'Barnave and the moderates made up about 260 lawmakers in the new Legislative Assembly; the radicals numbered around 136, and the rest around 350.', u"Initially, the majority was with Barnave, but the queen's policy led to the radicalization of the Assembly and the moderates lost control of the legislative process.", u'The moderate government collapsed in April 1792 and was replaced by a radical majority headed by the Girondins.', u'The Assembly then passed a series of laws concerning the Church, the aristocracy and the formation of new national guard units: all were vetoed by Louis XVI.', u"While Barnave's section had fallen to 120 members, the new Girondin majority controlled the legislative assembly with 330 members.", u'The two strongest members of that government were Jean Marie Roland, who was minister of interior, and General Dumouriez, the minister of foreign affairs.', u'Dumouriez sympathised with the royal couple and wanted to save them; however, he was rebuffed by the queen.', u"Marie Antoinette's actions in refusing to collaborate with the Girondins, in power between April and June 1792, led them to denounce the treason of the Austrian comity, a direct allusion to the queen.", u"After Madame Roland sent a letter to the king denouncing the queen's role in these matters, pushed by the queen, Louis XVI sacked the government, thus losing his majority in the Assembly.", u'Dumouriez resigned and refused a post in any new government.', u'At this point, the tide within the population and political parties against the royal authority intensified, while Marie Antoinette encouraged the king to veto the new laws voted by the Legislative Assembly in 1792.', u'In August 1791, the Declaration of Pillnitz threatened to invade France.', u'This led in turn to the French declaration of war in April 1792, which led to the French Revolutionary Wars and to the events of August 1792, which ended the monarchy.', u'On 20 June 1792, "a mob of terrifying aspect" broke into the Tuileries, made the king wear the bonnet rouge (red Phrygian cap) to show his loyalty to the Republic, insulted Marie Antoinette, accusing her of betraying France, and threatened her life.', u'In consequence, the queen asked Fersen to push the foreign powers to activate their invasion of France, and to issue a manifesto in which the foreign powers threatened to destroy Paris if anything happened to the royal family.', u'The Brunswick Manifesto, issued on 25 July 1792, triggered the events of 10 August when the approach of an armed mob on its way to the Tuileries Palace forced the royal family to seek refuge at the Legislative Assembly.', u'Ninety minutes later, the palace was invaded by the mob who massacred the Swiss Guards.', u'On 13 August, the royal family was imprisoned in the tower of the Temple in the Marais under conditions considerably harsher than those of their previous confinement in the Tuileries.', u"A week later, several of the royal family's attendants, among them the princesse de Lamballe, were taken in for interrogation by the Paris Commune.", u'Transferred to the La Force prison, after a rapid judgment, Marie Louise de Lamballe was savagely killed on 3 September.', u'Her head was affixed on a pike and marched through the city to the Temple for the queen to see.', u'Marie Antoinette was kept from seeing it, but fainted upon learning of it.', u'On 21 September 1792, the fall of the monarchy was officially declared, and the National Convention became the governing body of the French Republic.', u'The royal family was re-styled as the non-royal "Capets".', u'Preparations began for the trial of the king in a court of law.', u"=== Louis XVI's trial and execution ===\n\nCharged with undermining the First French Republic, Louis XVI was separated from his family and tried in December.", u'He was found guilty by the Convention led by the Jacobins who rejected the idea of keeping him as a hostage.', u'On 15 January 1793, by vote with a majority of one voice, that of Philippe \xc9galit\xe9, he was condemned to death by guillotine and was executed on 21 January 1793.', u'== Marie Antoinette in the Temple ==\nThe queen, now called "Widow Capet", plunged into deep mourning.', u"She still hoped her son, Louis XVII, whom the comte de Provence had, from exile, recognised as Louis XVI's successor, would one day rule France.", u'The royalists and the refractory clergy, including those preparing the insurrection in Vend\xe9e, supported Marie Antoinette and the return to the monarchy.', u'Throughout her imprisonment and up to her execution, Marie-Antoinette could count on the sympathy of conservative factions and social-religious groups which had turned against the Revolution, and also on wealthy individuals ready to corrupt republican officials in order to facilitate her escape; however, all plots failed.', u"Prisoners in the tower of the Temple, Marie Antoinette, her children and \xc9lisabeth were insulted, some of the guards going as far as smoking in the ex-queen's face.", u'Strict security measures were taken to assure that Marie Antoinette was not able to communicate with the outside world; but, despite these measures, several of the guardians were open to corruption, and a line of communication was kept with the outer world.', u"After Louis' execution, Marie Antoinette's fate became a central question of the National Convention.", u'While some advocated for her death, others proposed exchanging her for French prisoners of war or for a ransom from the Holy Roman Emperor.', u'Thomas Paine advocated exile to America.', u"In April 1793, during the Reign of Terror, a Committee of Public Safety dominated by Robespierre was formed, and men such as Jacques H\xe9bert began to call for Antoinette's trial.", u'By the end of May, the Girondins had been chased from power.', u'Calls were also made to "retrain" the eight-year old Louis XVII, to make him pliant to revolutionary ideas.', u'To carry this out, Louis Charles was separated from his mother on 3 July after a heartwrenching struggle during which his mother fought in vain to retain her son, who was handed to Antoine Simon, a cobbler, and representative of the Paris Commune.', u'Until her removal from the Temple, Marie Antoinette spent hours trying to catch a glimpse of her son, who, within weeks, had been made to turn against her, accusing his mother of wrongdoings.', u"=== Conciergerie ===\nOn the night of 1 August, at 1:00 in the morning, Marie Antoinette was transferred from the Temple to an isolated cell in the Conciergerie as 'Prisoner n\xb0 280'.", u'Leaving the tower without bending, she banged her head against the lintel of the door, which prompted one of her guards to ask her if she was hurt, to which she answered: "No!', u'Nothing now can hurt me."', u'This was the most difficult period of her captivity.', u'She was under constant surveillance, with no privacy.', u'The "Carnation Plot" (Le complot de l\'\u0153illet), an attempt to help her escape at the end of August, was foiled due to the inability to corrupt all the guards.', u'She was attended by Rosalie Lamorli\xe8re, who cared for her as much as and as well as she could.', u'At least once, she received the visit of a Catholic priest.', u'== Trial and execution (14\u201316 October 1793) ==\n\nMarie Antoinette was tried by the Revolutionary Tribunal on 14 October 1793.', u'Some historians believe the outcome of the trial had been decided in advance by the Committee of Public Safety around the time the Carnation Plot was uncovered.', u'She and her lawyers were given less than one day to prepare her defense.', u'Among the accusations, many previously published in the libelles, were: orchestrating orgies in Versailles, sending millions of livres of treasury money to Austria, planning the massacre of the "gardes fran\xe7aises" (National Guards) in 1792, declaring her son to be the new king of France, and\u2014by her son Louis Charles himself (pushed by radical elements who controlled him)\u2014of incest.', u'This last accusation drew an emotional response from Marie Antoinette, who refused to respond to this charge and, instead, called on all mothers present in the room: their reaction brought her comfort since these women were not sympathetic to her.', u'Early on 16 October, Marie Antoinette was declared guilty of the three main charges against her: depletion of the national treasury, conspiracy against the internal and external security of the State, intelligence with the enemy, this one alone being enough to condemn her to death.', u'At worst, she and her lawyers had expected life imprisonment.', u'In the hours left to her, she composed a letter to her sister-in-law, Madame \xc9lisabeth, affirming her clear conscience, her Catholic faith, and her love and concern for her children.', u'The letter did not reach \xc9lisabeth.', u'Preparing for her execution, she had to change clothes in front of her guards.', u'She put on a plain white dress, white being the color worn by widowed queens of France.', u'Her hair was shorn, her hands bound painfully behind her back and she was leashed with a rope.', u'Unlike her husband, who had been taken to his execution in a carriage (carrosse), she had to sit in an open cart (charrette) for the hour it took from the Conciergerie via the rue Saint-Honor\xe9 thoroughfare to reach the guillotine erected in Place de la R\xe9volution, (present-day Place de la Concorde).', u'She maintained her composure, despite the insults of the jeering crowd.', u'For her final confession, a constitutional priest was assigned to her.', u'He sat by her in the cart, and she ignored him all the way to the scaffold.', u'Marie Antoinette was guillotined at 12:15 p.m. on 16 October 1793.', u'Her last words were "Pardon me, sir, I meant not to do it", to Henri Sanson the executioner, whose foot she had accidentally stepped on after climbing to the scaffold.', u"Her body was thrown into an unmarked grave in the Madeleine cemetery located close by, rue d'Anjou.", u'Because of saturation, the cemetery was closed the following year, on 25 March 1794.', u"Both Marie Antoinette's and Louis XVI's bodies were exhumed on 18 January 1815, during the Bourbon Restoration, when the comte de Provence had ascended the newly reestablished throne as Louis XVIII, King of France and of Navarre.", u'Christian burial of the royal remains took place three days later, on 21 January, in the necropolis of French kings at the Basilica of St Denis.', u'== Legacy ==\nLong after her death, Marie Antoinette remains a major historical figure linked with conservatism, the Catholic Church, wealth, and fashion.', u'She has been the subject of a quantity of books, films and other forms of media.', u'Politically engaged authors have deemed her the quintessential representative of class conflict, western aristocracy and absolutism.', u'Some of her contemporaries, such as Jefferson, attributed to her the start of the French Revolution.', u'For others, Marie Antoinette was a victim of her family ambition and the general situation in France.', u'However, even her critics have recognized her qualities as a mother and her courage in dying.', u'== In popular culture ==\n\nThe phrase "Let them eat cake" is often attributed to Marie Antoinette, but there is no evidence she ever uttered it, and it is now generally regarded as a "journalistic clich\xe9".', u'This phrase originally appeared in Book VI of the first part (finished in 1767, published in 1782) of Jean-Jacques Rousseau\'s putative autobiographical work, Les Confessions: "Enfin je me rappelai le pis-aller d\'une grande princesse \xe0 qui l\'on disait que les paysans n\'avaient pas de pain, et qui r\xe9pondit: Qu\'ils mangent de la brioche" ("Finally I recalled the stopgap solution of a great princess who was told that the peasants had no bread, and who responded: \'Let them eat brioche\'").', u'Apart from the fact that Rousseau ascribes these words to an unknown princess, vaguely referred to as a "great princess", the purported writing date precedes Marie Antoinette\'s arrival in France.', u'Some think that he invented it altogether.', u'In the United States, expressions of gratitude to France for its help in the American Revolution included the naming of the city of Marietta, Ohio, founded in 1788.', u'The Ohio Company of Associates chose the name Marietta after an affectionate nickname for Marie Antoinette.', u'It can be also seen how her life has made for the production of many movies, from regal French movies to popular American movies, casting famous actors and actresses, one movie being "Marie Antoinette"\n\n\n== Ancestry ==\n\n\n== Issue ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nFrench Revolution\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n===

it is in fact one of the lower courts in such a process.', u'=== Hong Kong ===\nIn Hong Kong, the Supreme Court of Hong Kong (now known as the High Court of Hong Kong) was the final court of appeal during its colonial times which ended with transfer of sovereignty in 1997.', u'The final adjudication power, as in any other British Colonies, rested with the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (JCPC) in London, United Kingdom.', u'Now the power of final adjudication is vested in the Court of Final Appeal created in 1997.', u'Under the Basic Law, its constitution, the territory remains a common law jurisdiction.', u'Consequently, judges from other common law jurisdictions (including England and Wales) can be recruited and continue to serve in the judiciary according to Article 92 of the Basic Law.', u"On the other hand, the power of interpretation of the Basic Law itself is vested in the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) in Beijing (without retroactive effect), and the courts are authorised to interpret the Basic Law when trying cases, in accordance with Article 158 of the Basic Law.", u'This arrangement became controversial in light of the right of abode issue in 1999, raising concerns for judicial independence.', u'=== India ===\n\nIn India, the Supreme Court of India was created on January 28, 1950 after adoption of the Constitution.', u'Article 141 of the Constitution of India states that the law declared by Supreme Court is to be binding on all Courts within the territory of India.', u'It is the highest court in India and has ultimate judicial authority to interpret the Constitution and decide questions of national law (including local bylaws).', u'The Supreme Court is also vested with the power of judicial review to ensure the application of the rule of law.', u'Note that within the constitutional framework of India, Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) has a special status vis-a-vis the other states of India.', u'Article 370 of the Constitution of India carves out certain exceptions for J&K.', u'However, the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order 1954 makes Article 141 applicable to the state of J&K and hence law declared by the Supreme Court of India is equally applicable to all courts of J&K including the High Court.', u'=== Ireland ===\nThe Supreme Court is the highest court in the Republic of Ireland.', u'It has authority to interpret the constitution, and strike down laws and activities of the state that it finds to be unconstitutional.', u'It is also the highest authority in the interpretation of the law.', u'Constitutionally it must have authority to interpret the constitution but its further appellate jurisdiction from lower courts is defined by law.', u'The Irish Supreme Court consists of its presiding member, the Chief Justice, and seven other judges.', u'Judges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the President in accordance with the binding advice of the Government.', u'The Supreme Court sits in the Four Courts in Dublin.', u"=== Israel ===\nIsrael's Supreme Court is at the head of the court system in the State of Israel.", u'It is the highest judicial instance.', u'The Supreme Court sits in Jerusalem.', u'The area of its jurisdiction is the entire State.', u'A ruling of the Supreme Court is binding upon every court, other than the Supreme Court itself.', u'The Israeli supreme court is both an appellate court and the high court of justice.', u'As an appellate court, the Supreme Court considers cases on appeal (both criminal and civil) on judgments and other decisions of the District Courts.', u'It also considers appeals on judicial and quasi-judicial decisions of various kinds, such as matters relating to the legality of Knesset elections and disciplinary rulings of the Bar Association.', u'As the High Court of Justice (Hebrew: Beit Mishpat Gavoha Le\'Zedek \u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05de\u05e9\u05e4\u05d8 \u05d2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d4 \u05dc\u05e6\u05d3\u05e7; also known by its initials as Bagatz \u05d1\u05d2"\u05e5), the Supreme Court rules as a court of first instance, primarily in matters regarding the legality of decisions of State authorities: Government decisions, those of local authorities and other bodies and persons performing public functions under the law, and direct challenges to the constitutionality of laws enacted by the Knesset.', u'The court has broad discretionary authority to rule on matters in which it considers it necessary to grant relief in the interests of justice, and which are not within the jurisdiction of another court or tribunal.', u'The High Court of Justice grants relief through orders such as injunction, mandamus and Habeas Corpus, as well as through declaratory judgments.', u'The Supreme Court can also sit at a further hearing on its own judgment.', u'In a matter on which the Supreme Court has ruled -

Madison (1803).', u'There are currently nine seats on the US Supreme Court.', u"Each U.S. state has a state supreme court, which is the highest authority interpreting that state's law and administering that state's judiciary.", u'Two states, Oklahoma and Texas, each have two separate highest courts that respectively specialize in criminal cases and civil cases.', u'Although Delaware has a specialized court, the Court of Chancery, to hear cases in equity, it is not a supreme court because the Delaware Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over it.', u'The titles of state supreme court vary, which can cause confusion between jurisdictions because one state may use a name for its highest court that another uses for a lower court.', u'In New York, Maryland, and the District of Columbia the highest court is called the Court of Appeals, a name used by many states for their intermediate appellate courts.', u'Further, trial courts of general jurisdiction in New York are called the Supreme Court, and the intermediate appellate court is called the Supreme Court, Appellate Division.', u'In West Virginia, the highest court of the state is the Supreme Court of Appeals.', u'In Maine and Massachusetts the highest court is styled the "Supreme Judicial Court"; the last is the oldest appellate court of continuous operation in the Western Hemisphere.', u'== Civil law jurisdictions ==\nThe Roman law and the Corpus Juris Civilis are generally held to be the historical model for civil law.', u'From the late 18th century onwards, civil law jurisdictions began to codify their laws, most of all in civil codes.', u'=== Austria ===\nIn Austria, the Austrian Constitution of 1920 (based on a draft by Hans Kelsen) introduced judicial review of legislative acts for their constitutionality.', u'This function is performed by the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof), which is also charged with the review of administrative acts on whether they violate constitutionally guaranteed rights.', u'Other than that, administrative acts are reviewed by the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof).', u'The Supreme Court (Oberste Gerichtshof (OGH)), stands at the top of Austria\'s system of "ordinary courts" (ordentliche Gerichte) as the final instance in issues of private law and criminal law.', u'=== Brazil ===\nIn Brazil, the Supreme Federal Tribunal (Supremo Tribunal Federal) is the highest court.', u'It is both the constitutional court and the court of last resort in Brazilian law.', u'It only reviews cases that may be unconstitutional or final habeas corpus pleads for criminal cases.', u'It also judges, in original jurisdiction, cases involving members of congress, senators, ministers of state, members of the high courts and the President and Vice-President of the Republic.', u'The Superior Court of Justice (Tribunal Superior de Justi\xe7a) reviews State and Federal Circuit courts decisions for civil law and criminal law cases, when dealing with federal law or conflicting rulings.', u'The Superior Labour Tribunal (Tribunal Superior do Trabalho) reviews cases involving labour law.', u'The Superior Electoral Tribunal (Tribunal Superior Eleitoral) is the court of last resort of electoral law, and also oversees general elections.', u'The Superior Military Tribunal (Tribunal Superior Militar) is the highest court in matters of federal military law.', u'=== Croatia ===\nIn Croatia, the supreme jurisdiction is given to the Supreme Court, which secures a uniform application of laws.', u'The Constitutional Court exists to verify constitutionality of laws and regulations, as well as decide on individual complaints on decisions on governmental bodies.', u'It also decides on jurisdictional disputes between the legislative, executive and judicial branches.', u'=== Denmark ===\nIn Denmark, all ordinary courts have original jurisdiction to hear all types of cases, including cases of a constitutional or administrative nature.', u'As a result, there exists no special constitutional court, and therefore final jurisdiction is vested with the Danish Supreme Court (H\xf8jesteret) which was established 14 February 1661 by king Frederik III.', u"=== France ===\nIn France, supreme appellate jurisdiction is divided among three judicial bodies:\nfor judicial cases, i.e., civil or criminal matters: Court of Cassation (Cour de cassation)\nfor administrative cases: Council of State (Conseil d'\xc9tat)\nconstitutional challenges of statutory laws: Constitutional Council (Conseil constitutionnel)\nWhen there is jurisdictional dispute between judicial and administrative courts: the Court of Arbitration (Tribunal des conflits), which is empanelled half from the Court of Cassation and half from the Council of State and presided over by the Minister of Justice, is called together to settle the dispute or hand down a final decision.", u'The High Court (Haute Cour) exists only to impeach the President of the French Republic in case of "breach of his duties patently incompatible with his continuing in office".', u'Since a constitutional amendment of 2007, the French Constitution states that the High Court is composed of all members of both Houses of Parliament.', u'As of 2012, it has never been convened.', u'=== Germany ===\nIn Germany, there is no de jure single supreme court.', u'Instead, cases are handled by numerous federal courts, depending on their nature.', u'Final interpretation of and amendments to the German Constitution, the Grundgesetz, is the task of the Bundesverfassungsgericht (Federal Constitutional Court), which is the de facto highest German court, as it can declare both federal and state legislation ineffective, and has the power to overrule decisions of all other federal courts, despite not being a regular court of appeals on itself in the German court system.', u'It is also the only court possessing the power and authority to outlaw political parties, if it is deemed that these parties have repeatedly violated articles of the Constitution.', u'When it comes to civil and criminal cases, the Bundesgerichtshof is at the top of the hierarchy of courts.', u'The other branches of the German judicial system each have their own appellate systems, each topped by a high court; these are the Bundessozialgericht for matters of social security, the Bundesarbeitsgericht for employment and labour, the Bundesfinanzhof for taxation and financial issues, and the Bundesverwaltungsgericht for administrative law.', u"The so-called Gemeinsamer Senat der Obersten Gerichtsh\xf6fe (Joint Senate of the Supreme Courts) is not a supreme court in itself, but an ad-hoc body that is convened in only when one supreme court intends to diverge from another supreme court's legal opinion or when a certain case exceeds the authority of one court.", u'As the courts have well-defined areas of responsibility, situations like these are rather rare and so, the Joint Senate gathers very infrequently, and only to consider matters which are mostly definitory.', u'=== The Netherlands ===\nIn the Netherlands, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands is the highest.', u'Its decisions, known as "arresten", are absolutely final.', u'The court is banned from testing legislation against the constitution, pursuant to the principle of the sovereignty of the States-General; the court can, however, test legislation against some treaties.', u'Also, the ordinary courts in the Netherlands, including the Hoge Raad, do not deal with administrative law, which is dealt with in separate administrative courts, the highest of which is the Council of State (Raad van State)\n\n\n=== Iceland ===\nThe Supreme Court of Iceland (Icelandic: H\xe6stir\xe9ttur \xcdslands, lit.', u'Highest Court of Iceland) was founded under Act No.', u'22/1919 and held its first session on 16 February 1920.', u'The Court holds the highest judicial power in Iceland, where the court system has two levels.', u'=== India ===\nThe Supreme Court of India is also known as apex court.', u'Any decision taken by it is the last (except the president ).', u'IT has several jurisdiction like 1.', u'Original 2.Appellate 3.', u'Advisory\nIT is also known as court of records, i. e. All judgements are recorded and printed.', u'These are cited in lower courts as case - law in various cases.', u'=== Italy ===\nItaly follows the French system of different supreme courts.', u'The Italian court of last resort for most disputes is the Corte Suprema di Cassazione.', u'There is also a separate constitutional court, the Corte costituzionale, which has a duty of judicial review, and which can strike down legislation as being in conflict with the Constitution.', u'=== Japan ===\nIn Japan, the Supreme Court of Japan is called \u6700\u9ad8\u88c1\u5224\u6240 (Saik\u014d-Saibansho; called \u6700\u9ad8\u88c1 Saik\u014d-Sai for short), located in Chiyoda, Tokyo, and is the highest court in Japan.', u'It has ultimate judicial authority within Japan to interpret the Constitution and decide questions of national law (including local by laws).', u'It has the power of judicial review (i.e., it can declare Acts of Diet and Local Assembly, and administrative actions, unconstitutional).', u'=== Luxembourg ===\nIn Luxembourg, challenges on the conformity of the law to the Constitution are brought before the Cour Constitutionnelle (Constitutional Court).', u'\u2014 The most used and common procedure to present these challenges is by way of the "question pr\xe9judicielle" (prejudicial question).', u'The Court of last resort for civil and criminal proceedings is the "Cour de Cassation".', u'For administrative proceedings the highest court is the "Cour Administrative" (Administrative Court).', u'=== Macau ===\nThe supreme court of Macau is the Court of Final Appeal (Portuguese: Tribunal de \xdaltima Inst\xe2ncia; Chinese: \u6fb3\u9580\u7d42\u5be9\u6cd5\u9662).', u'=== Philippines ===\nWhile the Philippines is generally considered a civil law nation, its Supreme Court is heavily modelled after the American Supreme Court.', u'This can be attributed to the fact that the Philippines was colonized by both Spain and the United States, and the system of laws of both nations strongly influenced the development of Philippine laws and jurisprudence.', u'Even as the body of Philippine laws remain mostly codified, the Philippine Civil Code expressly recognizes that decisions of the Supreme Court "form part of the law of the land", belonging to the same class as statutes.', u'The 1987 Philippine Constitution also explicitly grants to the Supreme Court the power of judicial review over laws and executive actions.', u'The Supreme Court is composed of 1 Chief Justice and 14 Associate Justices.', u'The court sits either en banc or in divisions, depending on the nature of the case to be decided.', u"=== Peoples Republic of China ===\nIn the judicial system of mainland China the highest court of appeal is the Supreme People's Court.", u'This supervises the administration of justice by all subordinate "local" and "special" people\'s courts, and is the court of last resort for the whole People\'s Republic of China except for Macau and Hong Kong\n\n\n=== Portugal ===\nIn Portugal, there are several supreme courts, each with a specific jurisdition:\nThe Supreme Court of Justice (Supremo Tribunal de Justi\xe7a) - for judicial (civil and criminal) matters;\nThe Constitutional Court (Tribunal Constitucional) - for the constitutional matters;\nThe Supreme Administrative Court (Supremo Tribunal Administrativo) - for administrative and fiscal matters;\nThe Court of Auditors (Tribunal de Contas) - for auditing the public expenditure.', u'Until 2003, a fifth supreme court also existed for the military jurisdiction, this being the Supreme Military Court (Supremo Tribunal Militar).', u'Presently, in time of peace, the supreme court for military justice matters is the Supreme Court of Justice, which now includes four military judges.', u'=== Republic of China ===\nIn the Republic of China (Taiwan), there are three different courts of last resort:\nSupreme Court of the Republic of China (\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u9662): civil and criminal cases.', u'Supreme Administrative Court of the Republic of China (\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u6700\u9ad8\u884c\u653f\u6cd5\u9662): executive cases.', u'Council of Grand Justices (\u5927\u6cd5\u5b98\u6703\u8b70): interpretation of the Constitution, interpretation of laws and regulations, dissolution of political parties in violation of the Constitution, trial of impeachments against the President or Vice President.', u'The Council of Grand Justices, consisting of 15 justices and mainly dealing with constitutional issues, is the counterpart of constitutional courts in some countries.', u'All three courts are directly under the Judicial Yuan, whose president also serves as Chief Justice in the Council of Grand Justices.', u'=== Scotland ===\n\nFounded by papal bull in 1532, the Court of Session is the supreme civil court of Scotland, and the High Court of Justiciary is the supreme criminal court.', u'However, the absolute highest court (excluding criminal matters) is the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom.', u'=== Spain ===\n\nSpanish Supreme Court is the highest court for all cases in Spain (both private and public).', u'Only those cases related to human rights can be appealed at the Constitutional Court (which also decides about acts accordance with Spanish Constitution).', u'In Spain, high courts cannot create binding precedents; however, lower rank courts usually observe Supreme Court interpretations.', u'In most private law cases, two Supreme Court judgements supporting a claim are needed to appeal at the Supreme Court.', u'Five sections form the Spanish Supreme court:\nSection one judges private law cases (including commercial law).', u'Section two decides about criminal appeals.', u'Section three judges administrative cases and controls government normative powers.', u'Section four is dedicated to labour law.', u'Section five is dedicated to military justice.', u'=== Sweden ===\nIn Sweden, the Supreme Court and the Supreme Administrative Court respectively function as the highest courts of the land.', u'The Supreme Administrative Court considers cases concerning disputes between individuals and administrative organs, as well as disputes among administrative organs, while the Supreme Court considers all other cases.', u'The judges are appointed by the Government.', u'In most cases, the Supreme Courts will only grant leave to appeal a case (pr\xf6vningstillst\xe5nd) if the case involves setting a precedent in the interpretation of the law.', u'Exceptions are issues where the Supreme Court is the court of first instance.', u'Such cases include an application for a retrial of a criminal case in the light of new evidence, and prosecutions made against an incumbent minister of the Government for severe neglect of duty.', u'If a lower court has to try a case which involves a question where there is no settled interpretation of the law, it can also refer the question to the relevant Supreme Court for an answer.', u'=== Switzerland ===\nIn Switzerland, the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland is the final court of appeals.', u"Due to Switzerland's system of direct democracy, it has no authority to review the constitutionality of federal statutes, but the people can strike down a proposed law by referendum.", u'According to settled case law, however, the Court is authorised to review the compliance of all Swiss law with certain categories of international law, especially the European Convention of Human Rights.', u'=== Other civil law jurisdictions ===\nFor Honduras, see Supreme Court of Honduras.', u'For Peru see Supreme Court of Peru.', u'For Poland, see Supreme Court of the Republic of Poland.', u'For Uganda, see Supreme Court of Uganda\nFor Ukraine, see Supreme Court of Ukraine.', u'=== Sri Lanka ===\nIn Sri Lanka, the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka was created in 1972 after the adoption of a new Constitution.', u'The Supreme Court is the highest and final superior court of record and is empowered to exercise its powers, subject to the provisions of the Constitution.', u'The court rulings take precedence over all lower Courts.', u'The Sri Lanka judicial system is complex blend of both common-law and civil-law.', u'In some cases such as capital punishment, the decision may be passed on to the President of the Republic for clemency petitions.', u"However, when there is 2/3 majority in the parliament in favour of president (as with present), the supreme court and its judges' powers become nullified as they could be fired from their positions according to the Constitution, if the president wants.", u'Therefore, in such situations, Civil law empowerment vanishes.', u'=== South Africa ===\nIn South Africa, a "two apex" system existed from 1994 to 2013.', u'The Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) was created in 1994 and replaced the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa as the highest court of appeal in non-constitutional matters.', u'The SCA is subordinate to the Constitutional Court, which is the highest court in matters involving the interpretation and application of the Constitution.', u"But in August 2013 the Constitution was amended to make the Constitutional Court the country's single apex court, superior to the SCA in all matters, both constitutional and non-constitutional.", u'=== Thailand ===\nHistorically, citizens appealed directly to the King along his route to places out of the Palace.', u'A Thai King would adjudicate all disputes.', u'During the reign of King Chulalongkorn, an official department for appeals was set up, and, after Thailand adopted a democratic regime of government, Thai Supreme Court was established in 1891.', u'At present, the Supreme Court of Thailand retains the important status as the highest court of justice in the country.', u'Operating separately from the Administrative Court and the Constitutional Court, the judgement of the Supreme Court is considered as final.', u'=== United Arab Emirates ===\nIn the United Arab Emirates, the Federal Supreme Court of the United Arab Emirates was created in 1973 after the adoption of the Constitution.', u'The Supreme Court is the highest and final superior court of record and is empowered to exercise its powers, subject to the provisions of the Constitution.', u'The court rulings take precedence over all lower Courts.', u'The Emirati judicial system is complex blend of both Islamic law and civil law.', u'In some cases such as capital punishment, the decision may be passed on to the President of the country (currently Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan).', u'== Soviet-model jurisdictions ==\nIn most nations with constitutions modelled after the Soviet Union, the legislature was given the power of being the court of last resort.', u"In the People's Republic of China, the final power to interpret the law is vested in the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC).", u'This power includes the power to interpret the basic laws of Hong Kong and Macau, the constitutional documents of the two special administrative regions which are common law and Portuguese-based legal system jurisdictions respectively.', u'This power is a legislative power and not a judicial one in that an interpretation by the NPCSC does not affect cases which have already been decided.', u'== See also ==\nConstitutionalism\nIndependence of the judiciary\nJudiciary\nList of national supreme courts\nSeparation of

{'sentences': [u'A public transport timetable (also timetable and North American English schedule) is a document setting out information on service times, to assist passengers with planning a trip.', u'Typically, the timetable will list the times when a service is scheduled to arrive at and depart from specified locations.', u'It may show all movements at a particular location or all movements on a particular route or for a particular stop.', u'Traditionally this information was provided in printed form, for example as a leaflet or poster.', u'It is now also often available in a variety of electronic formats.', u"In the 2000s public transport route planners / intermodal journey planners have proliferated and offer traveller the convenience that the computer program looks at all timetables so the traveller doesn't need to.", u'A "timetable" may also refer to the same information in abstract form, not specifically published, e.g.', u'"A new timetable has been introduced".', u'== History ==\n\nThe first compilation of railway timetables in the United Kingdom was produced in 1839 by George Bradshaw.', u'Greater speeds and the need for more accurate timings led to the introduction of standard railway time in Great Western Railway timetables in 1840, when all their trains were scheduled to "London time", i.e.', u'Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), which replaced solar time.', u'Until railway time was introduced, local times for London, Birmingham, Bristol and Manchester could differ by as much as 16 to 20 minutes; in India and North America these differences could be 60 minutes or more.', u'The European Rail Timetable, a compendium of the schedules of major European railway services, has been in publication since 1873 (appearing monthly since 1883).', u"Originally, and for most of its history, it was published by Thomas Cook & Son and included Thomas Cook or Cook's in its title.", u'Although Thomas Cook Group plc ceased publication in 2013, the Thomas Cook European Rail Timetable was revived by a new company in early 2014 as simply the European Rail Timetable.', u'From 1981 to 2010, Cook also produced a similar bi-monthly Overseas volume covering the rest of the world, and some of that content was moved into the European Timetable in 2011.', u'== Representation ==\nA timetable can be produced dynamically, on request, for a particular journey on a particular day around a particular time (see journey planner, below), or in a timetable that gives an overview of all services in a particular category and is valid for a specified period.', u'The latter could take the form of a book, leaflet, billboard, or a (set of) computer file(s), and makes it much easier to find out, for example, whether a transport service at a particular time is offered every day at that time, and if not, on which days; with a journey planner one may have to check every day of the year separately for this.', u'=== Matrix format ===\nMany timetables comprise tables with services shown in columns, and stations or stops on the rows of the table.', u'There will often be separate tables for each direction of travel, and often separate (pairs of) tables for weekdays, Saturdays and Sundays.', u'Generally the times shown against each station or stop will be the departure time, except for the last stop of the service which will be the arrival time.', u'The left hand column will list the stations in route order, and the other columns are arranged from left to right in chronological order.', u'If the service is scheduled to wait, both arrival and departure times might be shown on consecutive rows.', u'If a slow service is overtaken by a fast service, the slow service will often occupy more than one column, to keep the times in order.', u'There may be additional rows showing connecting services.', u'Times are usually shown using the 24-hour clock, but often in the United States and occasionally in the United Kingdom the 12-hour clock is used, with "am/A" or "pm/P" added.', u'If services run at the same minutes past each hour for part of the day, the legend "and at the same minutes past each hour" or similar wording may be shown instead of individual timings.', u'Other information may be shown, often at the tops of the columns, such as day(s) of operation, validity of tickets for each service, whether seat reservations are required, the type of vehicle used (e.g.', u'for heritage railways and airline timetables), the availability of on-board facilities such as refreshments, availability of classes, and a service number.', u'Timetables with services arranged in rows of tables and stops or stations in columns are less common but otherwise similar to timetables with services in columns.', u'=== Stop-specific displays ===\nSome timetables, particularly at railway stations and bus stops, list the times that services depart from that location, sometimes with other information such as destinations and stopping conditions.', u'Again, there may be separate lists for different days of the week.', u'There may be a separate list for each line/direction, or a combined chronological list (as in the picture).', u'In parts of mainland Europe train departures are listed on a yellow poster, and arrivals on a white poster.', u'These posters are placed at entrances to stations and on platforms.', u'=== Electronic displays ===\nDynamic electronic displays in stations may be at a central place and list the next few departures for each line, or all departures in the next hour.', u'Displays on platforms usually just show the next departure (or perhaps the next few) from that platform.', u'== Formats ==\nTimetables may be printed as books, booklets, folded or plain cards or paper, posters, or hand-written on posters or blackboards, shown on back-lit displays, or published on-line or as SMS or text messages.', u'With the development of the internet and electronic systems, conventional thick paper timetables are gradually being replaced by website searching or CD-ROM style timetables, and the publication of comprehensive printed timetables is generally decreasing.', u'Transport schedule data itself is increasingly being made available to the public digitally, as specified in the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) format.', u'== Scheduling ==\n\nIn many modern public transport systems, timetables and rostering are generated by computer, with the operators specifying the required operating span, minimum frequencies, route length/time and other such factors.', u'Design of the schedule may aim to make times memorable for passengers, through the use of clock-face scheduling \u2014 services departing at regular intervals, at the same times every hour.', u'This is less likely to apply at peak times, when the priority is optimum utilisation of available vehicles and staff.', u'=== Headway services ===\nIn large cities services may be so frequent that consulting a timetable is unnecessary.', u'In some cases public transport operators do not publish public timetables for busy times of day, or they may simply state "services run every 3\u20135 minutes" (or words to that effect)\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== International timetables ==\nThomas Cook European Timetable\nA monthly timetable book of major trains, some bus and ferry

appeared in 1894, published by a private company.', u'By the time of the nationalization of Japanese railways in 1906, three competing timetables were being published and it was decided that only one official timetable should be offered to the public.', u'Five thousand copies of the first official timetable were published in January 1915.', u'In 2010, two printed national timetables were available: the Japan Tourist Bureau (JTB) Timetable (JTB\u6642\u523b\u8868) and the Japan Railways (JR) Timetable (JR\u6642\u523b\u8868\uff09.', u'These thick books - the February 2009 edition of the

frequent JR urban lines, subway trains, private railways and urban buses, only summary timetables are shown.', u'In 2009, a book was published to mark the 1000th edition of the JTB timetable, containing reproductions of all one thousand covers, selected timetables and maps, and articles on the way the timetable is produced.', u'There are also many searchable online timetables covering all

European train timetables are amended.', u'There are seldom major changes to important routes, but the change allows for alterations to international services and for seasonal variation.', u'Currently the dates for the European train timetable changes are usually the Sunday of the second weekend in June and in December.', u'In the months leading up to the changeover date booking will be restricted

0600UT to 0900UT.', u'The westbound flow generally operates within a 1200\u20131500UT time-slot.', u'Restrictions on how far a given aircraft may be from an airport also play a part in determining its route; in the past, airliners with three or more engines were not restricted, but a twin-engine airliner was required to stay within a certain distance of airports that could accommodate it (since a single engine failure in a four-engine aircraft is less crippling than a single engine failure in a twin).', u'Modern aircraft with two engines flying transatlantic (the most common models used for transatlantic service being the Airbus A330, Boeing 767 and Boeing 777) have to be ETOPS certified.', u"Gaps in air traffic control and radar coverage over large stretches of the Earth's oceans, as well as an absence of most types of radio navigation aids, impose a requirement for a high level of autonomy in navigation upon transatlantic flights.", u"Aircraft must include reliable systems that can determine the aircraft's course and position with great accuracy over long distances.", u'In addition to the traditional compass, inertials and satellite navigation systems such as GPS all have their place in transatlantic navigation.', u'Land-based systems such as VOR and DME, because they operate "line of sight", are mostly useless for ocean crossings, except in initial and final legs within about 240 nautical miles (440 km) of those facilities.', u'In the late 1950s and early 1960s an important facility for low-flying aircraft was the Radio Range.', u'Inertial navigation systems

restaurants were located on "R" deck) to make way for Jacques Cousteau\'s new Living Sea Museum.', u'This increased museum space to 400,000 square feet (37,000 m2).', u'It required removal of all the boiler rooms, the forward engine room, both turbo generator rooms, the ship stabilisers, and the water softening plant.', u"The ship's empty fuel tanks were filled with local mud to keep the ship's centre of gravity and draft at the correct levels, as these critical factors had been affected by the removal of the various components and structure.", u'Only the aft engine room and "shaft alley", at the stern of the ship, would be spared.', u'Remaining space would be used for storage or office space.', u'One problem that arose during the conversion was a dispute between land-based and maritime unions over conversion jobs.', u'The United States Coast Guard had final say.', u'Queen Mary was deemed a building, since most of her propellers had been removed and her machinery gutted.', u'The ship was also repainted with its red water level paint at a slightly higher level than previously.', u'During the conversion the funnels were removed, as this area was needed to lift out the scrap materials from the engine and boiler rooms.', u'Workers found that the funnels were significantly degraded and they were replaced with replicas.', u'With all of the lower decks nearly gutted from R deck and down, Diners Club, the initial lessee of the ship, converted the remainder of the vessel into a hotel.', u'Diners Club Queen Mary dissolved and vacated the ship in 1970 after their parent company, Diners Club International, was sold, and a change in corporate direction was mandated during the conversion process.', u'Specialty Restaurants, a Los Angeles-based company that focused on theme-based restaurants, took over as master lessee the following year.', u'This second plan was based on converting most of her first- and second-class cabins on A and B decks into hotel rooms, and converting the main lounges and dining rooms into banquet spaces.', u"On Promenade Deck, the starboard promenade was enclosed to feature an upscale restaurant and caf\xe9 named Lord Nelson's and Lady Hamilton's; it was themed in the fashion of early-19th-century sailing ships.", u'The famed and elegant Observation Bar was redecorated as a western-themed bar.', u'The smaller first-class public rooms, such as the Drawing Room, Library, Lecture Room and the Music studio, would be stripped of most of their fittings and converted to commercial use.', u'This markedly expanded retail space on the ship.', u"Two more shopping malls were built on the Sun Deck in separate spaces previously used for first-class cabins and engineers' quarters.", u'A post-war feature of the ship, the first-class cinema, was removed for kitchen space for the new Promenade Deck dining venues.', u'The first-class lounge and smoking room were reconfigured and converted into banquet space.', u'The second-class smoking room was subdivided into a wedding chapel and office space.', u'On the Sun Deck, the elegant Verandah Grill would be gutted and converted into a fast-food eatery, while a new upscale dining venue was created directly above it on Sports Deck, in space once used for crew quarters.', u'The second-class lounges were expanded to the sides of the ship and used for banqueting.', u'On R deck, the first-class dining room was reconfigured and subdivided into two banquet venues, the Royal Salon and the Windsor Room.', u'The second-class dining room was subdivided into kitchen storage and a crew mess hall, while the third-class dining room was initially used as storage and crew space.', u'Also on R deck, the first-class Turkish bath complex, the 1930s equivalent to a spa, was removed.', u'The second-class pool was removed and its space initially used for office space, while the first-class swimming pool was used for hotel guests.', u'Combined with modern safety codes and the structural soundness of the area directly below, the swimming pool is no longer in use.', u'No crew cabins remain intact aboard the ship today.', u'=== As a tourist attraction ===\n\nOn 8 May 1971 Queen Mary opened her doors to tourists.', u"Initially, only portions of the ship were open to the public as Specialty Restaurants had yet to open its dining venues and PSA had not completed work converting the ship's original First Class staterooms into the hotel.", u'As a result, the ship was open only on weekends.', u"On 11 December 1971 Jacques Cousteau's Museum of the Sea opened, with a quarter of the planned exhibits completed.", u"Within the decade, Cousteau's museum closed due to low ticket sales and the deaths of many of the fish that were housed in the museum.", u"On 2 November 1972 PSA's hotel opened its initial 150 guest rooms.", u'Two years later, with all 400 rooms finished, PSA brought in Hyatt Hotels to manage the hotel.', u'It operated the facility from 1974 to 1980 as the Queen Mary Hyatt Hotel.', u'By 1980, it had become apparent that the existing system was not working.', u'The ship was losing millions each year for the city because the hotel, restaurants and museum were run by three separate concessionaires, while the city owned the vessel and operated guided tours.', u'It was decided that a single operator with more experience in attractions was needed.', u'Jack Wrather, a local millionaire, had fallen in love with the ship because he and his wife, Bonita Granville, had fond memories of sailing on it numerous times.', u'Wrather signed a 66-year lease with the city of Long Beach to operate the entire property.', u'He oversaw the display of the Spruce Goose, on long-term loan.', u'The immense plane, which had been sitting in a hangar in Long Beach for decades unseen by the public, was installed in a huge geodesic dome adjacent to the liner in 1983, attracting increased attendance.', u'His Wrather Port Properties operated the entire attraction after his death in 1984 until 1988, when his holdings were bought by the Walt Disney Company.', u'Wrather had built the Disneyland Hotel in 1955, when Walt Disney had insufficient funds to construct the resort himself.', u'Disney had been trying to buy the hotel for 30 years.', u'When they finally succeeded, they also acquired the Queen Mary.', u'This was never marketed as a Disney property.', u'Through the late 1980s and early 1990s the Queen Mary struggled financially.', u'Disney pinned their hopes for turning the attraction around on Port Disney, a huge planned resort on the adjacent docks.', u"It was to include a theme park known as DisneySea, themed around the world's oceans.", u'The plans eventually fell through; in 1992 Disney gave up the lease on the ship to focus on building what would become Disney California Adventure Park.', u'The DisneySea concept was recycled a decade later in Japan as Tokyo DisneySea, with a recreated ocean liner resembling Queen Mary named the SS Columbia as the centerpiece of the American Waterfront area.', u'With Disney gone, the Hotel Queen Mary closed on 30 September 1992.', u'The owners of the Spruce Goose, the Aero Club of Southern California, sold the plane to the Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum in Oregon.', u'The plane departed on barges on 2 October 1992, leaving the huge dome empty.', u'The Queen Mary tourist attraction remained open for another two months, but on 31 December 1992, the Queen Mary completely closed her doors to tourists and visitors.', u'On 5 February 1993, RMS Foundation, Inc signed a five-year lease with the city of Long Beach to act as the operators of the property.', u'The foundation was run by President and C.E.O.', u'Joseph F. Prevratil, who had managed the attraction for Wrather.', u'On 26 February 1993 the tourist attraction reopened completely, while the hotel reopened partially on 5 March with 125 rooms and the banquet facilities, with the remainder of the rooms coming on line on 30 April.', u"In 1995, RMS Foundation's lease was extended to twenty years, while the scope of the lease was reduced to operation of the ship.", u"A new company, Queen's Seaport Development, Inc. (QSDI), was established in 1995 to control the real estate adjacent to the vessel.", u'In 1998, the City of Long Beach extended the QSDI lease to 66 years.', u'In 2005, QSDI sought Chapter 11 protection due to a rent credit dispute with the City.', u'In 2006, the bankruptcy court requested bids from parties interested in taking over the lease from QSDI.', u'The minimum required opening bid was $41M.', u'The operation of the ship, by RMS Foundation, remained independent of the bankruptcy.', u'In Summer 2007, Queen Mary\'s lease was sold to a group named "Save the Queen," managed by Hostmark Hospitality Group.', u'They planned to develop the land adjacent to Queen Mary, and upgrade, renovate, and restore the ship.', u"During their management, staterooms were updated with iPod docking stations and flatscreen TVs, and the ship's three funnels and waterline area were repainted their original Cunard Red color.", u"The portside Promenade Deck's planking was restored and refinished.", u"Many lifeboats were repaired and patched, and the ship's kitchens were renovated with new equipment.", u"In 2004, Queen Mary and Stargazer Productions added Tibbies Great American Cabaret to the space previously occupied by the ship's bank and wireless telegraph room.", u'Stargazer Productions and Queen Mary transformed the space into a working dinner theatre complete with stage, lights, sound, and scullery.', u'In late September 2009, management of Queen Mary was taken over by Delaware North Companies, who plan to continue restoration and renovation of the ship and its property.', u'They were determined to revitalise and enhance the ship as an attraction.', u'But in April 2011, The City Of Long Beach was informed that Delaware North was no longer managing Queen Mary.', u'Garrison Investment Group said this decision was purely business.', u'Delaware North still manages Scorpion, a Soviet submarine that has been a separate attraction next to Queen Mary since 1998.', u'Evolution Hospitality, LLC.', u'assumed operational control of the Queen Mary on 23 September 2011, with Garrison Investments leasing Queen Mary.', u'In 2016 Urban Commons, a real estate company, assumed the lease of the Queen Mary.', u'They revealed plans to extensively renovate the liner over the next year, and to redevelop the adjacent 45 acres of parking with a boutique hotel, restaurants, a marina, an amphitheater, jogging trails, bike paths, and possibly a huge Ferris wheel, all at a cost of up to $250 million.', u'=== Meeting of the Queens ===\n\nOn 23 February 2006, RMS Queen Mary 2 saluted her predecessor as she made a port of call in Los Angeles Harbor, while on a cruise to Mexico.', u'On March 2011, Queen Mary was saluted by the MS Queen Victoria while fireworks were going on, and on 12 March 2013, the MS Queen Elizabeth made a salute while there were fireworks.', u'The salute was carried out with Queen Mary replying with her one working air horn in response to Queen Mary 2 sounding her combination of two brand new horns and an original 1934 Queen Mary horn (on loan from the City of Long Beach).', u'Queen Mary originally had three whistles tuned to 55 Hz, a frequency chosen because it was low enough that the extremely loud sound of it would not be painful to human ears.', u"Modern IMO regulations specify ships' horn frequencies to be in the range 70\u2013200 Hz for vessels that are over 200 metres (660 ft) in length.", u'Traditionally, the lower the frequency, the larger the ship.', u'Queen Mary 2, being 345 metres (1,132 ft) long, was given the lowest possible frequency (70 Hz) for her regulation whistles, in addition to the refurbished 55 Hz whistle on permanent loan.', u'Fifty-five Hz is the "A" note an octave above the lowest note of a standard piano keyboard.', u'The air-driven Tyfon whistle can be heard at least 10 miles (16 km) away.', u"=== W6RO ===\nQueen Mary's original, professionally manned wireless radio room was removed when the ship was moored in Long Beach.", u'In its place, an amateur radio room was created one deck above the original radio reception room, with some of the discarded original radio equipment used for display purposes.', u'The amateur radio station, with the call sign W6RO ("Whiskey Six Romeo Oscar"), relies on volunteers from a local amateur radio club.', u'They staff the radio room during most public hours.', u'The radios can also be used by other licensed amateur radio operators.', u'In honour of his over forty years of dedication to W6RO and Queen Mary, in November 2007 the Queen Mary Wireless Room was renamed as the Nate Brightman Radio Room.', u"This was announced on 28 October 2007, at Brightman's 90th birthday party by Joseph Prevratil, former President and CEO of the Queen Mary.", u"=== Rumors of hauntings ===\nFollowing Queen Mary's permanent docking in California, the ship was rumored to be haunted.", u'Since the 1980s, this supposed haunting has been featured in the marketing and promotion of the ship, with various attractions and tours presenting the theme for visitors.', u'The ship was ranked as "one of the top 10 most haunted places in America" by Time Magazine in 2008.', u"In particular, Cabin B340 (formerly Cabin B326, prior to the ship's refitting after World War II) is alleged to be haunted by the spirit of a person who was murdered there.", u'Individuals have reported hearing sounds of children playing in the nursery.', u'Other reported ghosts include a young sailor who was accidentally killed in the ship\'s engine room, crewmembers of the Curacoa who were killed when Queen Mary collided with her, and an unidentified "lady in white".', u'At least one book has been written on the subject.', u"At least 49 crew and passengers are known to have died during the Queen Mary's service as a luxury liner.", u"Although many hauntings are reported as the ghosts of drowning victims, the ship's logs do not record any instances of passengers drowning.", u'Approximately 75% of the deaths were crew members, and about 25% were passengers.', u'It is unknown how many servicemen or POWs died aboard the Queen Mary during her stint as a troop transport ship in World War II.', u'Paranormal researcher John Champion writes in Skeptical Inquirer Magazine that he understands why people persist in believing that the Queen Mary is haunted when the only evidence given is anecdotes, creepy feelings and shadows.', u'Tourists who sign up for the haunted tour are given access to normally off limit areas of the ship, while tours of the history of the ship are more limited.', u'Champion believes that the owners are doing a disservice to the real history, the people who should be honored "by remembering who they really were and what they actually did".', u"He understands why people report strange occurrences, the ship still creaks and groans, and people's imaginations can get away from them such that they start seeing and hearing all kinds of things, attributing them to the paranormal which they have been primed for.", u'"Ghost stories are fine", concludes Champion "when presented as such.', u'The confusion of science and history with fiction ... gets us further away from the ability to relish in and truly explore our own recent history."', u'The ship has been the site of many paranormal television shows including Ghost Hunters, Ghost Adventures, Fact or Faked and Most Haunted.', u'== See also ==\n\nRMS Mauretania (1938)\nMS Queen Elizabeth\nMS Queen Victoria\nRMS St Helena, one of the last Royal Mail Ships\n\n\n==

multi-day space flight by the United States, designed to show that it was possible for humans to remain in space for extended lengths of time.', u'The four-day, 66-orbit flight would approach but not break the five-day record set by the Soviet Vostok 5 in June 1963.', u'Subsequent Gemini flights would be longer, to prove endurance exceeding the time required to fly to the Moon and back.', u'A second objective was the first American extra-vehicular activity (EVA), known popularly as a "space walk".', u'The first space walk had already been performed by Soviet Alexei Leonov on Voskhod 2 in March 1965.', u'NASA moved up the spacewalk from the original schedule, to demonstrate that the US was gaining on the early lead taken by the Soviets in what was known as the Space Race.', u'As late as 11 days before the scheduled June 3 launch, newspapers were reporting that NASA was saying it "had not yet determined whether White would be the first American astronaut to expose himself to the elements of space," and that "A decision might not be made until a day or two before launching."', u'A third objective was for Gemini 4 to attempt the first space rendezvous, flying in formation with the spent second stage of its Titan II launch vehicle.', u"== Flight ==\n\n\n=== Launch ===\n\nLaunched from LC-19 at Cape Kennedy Air Force Station, Florida, Gemini 4 was the first flight to be controlled by the new Mission Control Center at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, Texas, which had to conduct three-shift operations due to the flight's long duration.", u'The broadcast of the launch was itself historic.', u'For the first time an international audience, from 12 European nations, could watch the lift-off on live television via the Early Bird satellite.', u'Press interest, due to the satellite broadcast and the new center in Houston, proved to be so high that NASA had to lease buildings to accommodate the 1,100 print and broadcast journalists who requested accreditation.', u'Flight control shifted from Cape Kennedy to Houston as soon as the vehicle cleared the launch tower.', u'Except for a few moments of pogo oscillation (axial vibrations in the rocket), the launch came off perfectly, the spacecraft entering into an 87-by-153-nautical-mile (161 by 283 km) orbit.', u'=== Rendezvous attempt ===\nOn the first orbit, McDivitt attempted to rendezvous with the spent Titan second stage.', u'This was unsuccessful for a number of reasons:\nNASA engineers had not yet worked out the idiosyncrasies of orbital mechanics involved in rendezvous, which are counter-intuitive.', u'Simply thrusting the spacecraft toward the target changed its orbital altitude and velocity relative to the target.', u'When McDivitt tried this, he found himself moving away and downward, as the retrograde thrust lowered his orbit, increasing his speed.', u'The stage was dumping its residual propellant, causing it to move around in various directions relative to the Gemini.', u'There were only two running lights on the stage, which made it hard at times for McDivitt to determine its orientation.', u'McDivitt concluded that a rendezvous target should have at least three lights.', u'There was no radar on board Gemini 4 to give a precise range to the target, so the astronauts had to rely on their visual depth perception to estimate the range, and this differed for the two men.', u'Initially McDivitt estimated the distance at 400\u2013500 feet (120\u2013150 m), while White believed it was closer ("a little over 200 feet (61 m)").', u"At the worst point, McDivitt estimated it was about a half mile (800 meters) away, while White's estimate was three-quarters of a mile (1200 meters).", u"McDivitt estimated he was able to get as close as 200 feet (61 m), but now White's estimate was between 850 and 1,000 feet (260 and 300 m).", u'After expending almost half his thruster fuel, McDivitt finally gave up, in order to concentrate on the more important EVA objective.', u'(Rendezvous was finally achieved successfully by Wally Schirra commanding Gemini 6A in December.)', u"After the rendezvous, Gemini 4's orbit was now 89.2 by 155 nautical miles (165.2 by 287.1 km).", u'Twenty-two hours into the mission, Mission Control estimated the orbit would decay to 81 by 125.7 nautical miles (150.0 by 232.8 km) at the end of 63 revolutions.', u'=== Extra-vehicular activity (EVA) ===\n\nOriginally planned for the second revolution, the astronauts postponed the EVA until the third after McDivitt decided that White, following the stress of the launch and the failed rendezvous, looked tired and hot.', u'After a rest, the pair finished performing the checklist for the EVA.', u'Flying over Carnarvon, Australia, they began to depressurize the cabin.', u'Over Hawaii, White pulled the handle to open his hatch, but the latches failed to move.', u'Fortunately, McDivitt knew what the problem was, because the hatch had failed to close in a vacuum chamber test on the ground, after which McDivitt worked with a technician to see what the cause was.', u'A spring, which forced gears to engage in the mechanism, had failed to compress, and McDivitt got to see how the mechanism worked.', u'In flight, he was able to help White get it open, and thought he could get it to latch again.', u'There were communication problems during the spacewalk.', u"Gemini spacecraft were the first to use a voice-operated switch (known as VOX) on the astronaut's microphones, but McDivitt soon realized his VOX circuit wasn't working properly; he could only hear the Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM) in the push-to-talk setting, but not on VOX (though both astronauts could be heard by each other and the ground.)", u'Plus, while outside the spacecraft, White was unable to receive transmissions from the ground and had to have all messages relayed through McDivitt.', u'McDivitt must have switched to the VOX setting somewhere around the time White was exiting the spacecraft, because at that point, for most of the EVA, neither he nor White responded either to the Hawaii CAPCOM, or to the Houston CAPCOM, Gus Grissom.', u'Grissom tried to talk to Gemini 4 a total of 40 times in 13 minutes before he got a response.', u'Tied to a tether, White floated out of the spacecraft, using a Hand-Held Maneuvering Unit (informally called a "zip gun") which expelled pressurized oxygen to provide thrust for controlling his travel.', u'He went fifteen feet (five meters) out, and began to experiment with maneuvering.', u'He found it easy, especially the pitch and yaw, although he thought the roll would use too much gas.', u'He maneuvered around the spacecraft while McDivitt took photographs.', u'White enjoyed the experience, but exhausted the HHMU gas sooner than he would have liked.', u'White was running up against two factors which constrained the time for his EVA: loss of signal from the Bermuda tracking station, and crossing the solar terminator.', u"The flight controllers were becoming increasingly frustrated with their inability to remind White of the time constraint, because they didn't want the first EVA to be performed in darkness, or out of communication with Earth.", u"Finally McDivitt decided to take his microphone off of VOX:\nMcDivitt, to White: I'm going out to PUSH-TO-TALK and see what the Flight Director has got to say.", u'Flight Director Chris Kraft, to Grissom: The flight director says, get back in!', u'(Kraft was not on the air-to-ground loop with the astronauts.)', u'McDivitt: Gus, this is Jim.', u'Got any message for us?', u'Grissom: Gemini 4, get back in!', u'McDivitt: Okay.', u'... (to White): ...', u'They want you to come back in now.', u'White tried to use taking more pictures as an excuse to stay out longer, and McDivitt had to coax him in.', u'He finally came back in after a total of approximately 20 minutes.', u'He said, "It\'s the saddest moment of my life."', u'By the time he got in, the spacecraft had entered darkness.', u'The hatch proved to be as stubborn to relatch as it was to open.', u"This would have been disastrous, resulting in both men's deaths on reentry.", u'But McDivitt was able to fix the mechanism once again, so White could close it.', u"The mission plan called for opening the hatch again to throw out White's now-unnecessary EVA equipment, but McDivitt elected not to do this, instead keeping the unnecessary equipment on board for the rest of the flight.", u"They powered down the spacecraft's maneuvering system, intending to drift for the next two-and-a-half days to conserve the remaining fuel.", u'They also intended to sleep alternate four-hour periods, but this turned out to be extremely difficult with the constant radio communications and the small cabin, about the size of the front seats of a compact car.', u"White's 20-minute space walk was the mission's highlight, with McDivitt's photographs being published worldwide.", u"These also showed White wearing an Omega 'Speedmaster' chronograph watch on his spacesuit sleeve, one of two makes which had been approved by NASA for space use following extensive tests.", u"Omega were unaware of these tests or the fact that their product was going to be used in space, until they saw McDivitt's photos.", u'The model worn during the spacewalk is now known as the "Ed White" by watch collectors.', u'=== Experiments ===\nEleven experiments were carried on the spacecraft:\nExperiment D-8 used five dosimeters to measure the radiation in the spacecraft environment.', u'Of particular interest was the South Atlantic Anomaly.', u'Experiment D-9 was an experiment in simple spacecraft navigation where the crew used a sextant to measure their position using the stars.', u'The objective was to investigate the feasibility of using this technique for lunar flights on the Apollo program.', u'Experiments S-5 and S-6 were both photography experiments where they used a 70-millimeter Hasselblad camera to photograph the weather and terrain below them.', u'There were two medical experiments: M-3 and M-4.', u'The first was a bungee cord that the crew used for exercise.', u'They said, after the mission, that this got harder as the mission went on, though this may have been due to a lack of sleep.', u'The second was the phonocardiogram experiment, which had sensors attached to their bodies that measured heartbeat rates, especially during liftoff, EVA, and reentry.', u'There were four engineering experiments:\nMSC-1 measured the electrostatic charge in the spacecraft,\nMSC-2 was a proton-electron spectrometer,\nMSC-3 was a tri-axis magnetometer and\nMSC-10 involved the crew photographing the red-blue Earth limb.', u'=== Reentry ===\n\nThe computer failed on the 48th revolution.', u'This was unfortunate for IBM which had just put an advertisement in the Wall Street Journal saying that its computers were so reliable that even NASA used them.', u'The computer failure meant that the capsule would not be able to perform a closed-loop lifting reentry as planned.', u'Reentry came on the 62nd revolution.', u'An open-loop rolling reentry (as used in Mercury) had to be used because of the computer failure.', u'The astronauts began rolling the spacecraft at 65 nautical miles (120 km) altitude to increase its stability.', u'They started slowing the roll rate at 89,000 feet (27 km) and stopped it by 39,000 feet (12 km).', u'The drogue parachute deployed shortly after this, and the main deployed at 10,600 feet (3.2 km).', u'A malfunctioning thruster caused the roll to be much faster than planned, and the landing was rough.', u"Neither of the crew encountered any problems, however, contrary to NASA doctors' concerns about their landing upright \u2014 as opposed to on their backs, as in Mercury \u2014 after four days in space.", u'Even though they landed 43 nautical miles (80 km) short of the intended landing target, some ships had already started steaming to the touchdown point and a helicopter was able to see them land.', u'The prime recovery ship was USS Wasp.', u'The recovery was supported by 10,249 U.S. Department of Defense personnel, 134 aircraft, and 26 ships.', u"== Insignia ==\n\nGemini 4's crew originally intended to call their spacecraft American Eagle, but this was rejected after NASA management issued a memo saying that they did not want a repeat performance of the previous mission, on which Gus Grissom had named his spacecraft Molly Brown.", u'The callsign for the mission became simply Gemini 4.', u"There was no patch flown on the crew's suits, although the one shown here, created after the fact, is on display in McDivitt's museum.", u'Since McDivitt and White were prohibited from naming their spacecraft, they decided to put the American flag on their suits, the first astronauts to do so, although Soviet crews wore the Cyrillic "\u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420" on their spacesuit helmets.', u'Previous astronauts had only had the NASA insignia and a strip with their name on their suits.', u'The flight

u'On 11 September 1972, Ugandan dictator Idi Amin sent a telegram to Waldheim, copies of which went to Yasser Arafat and Golda Meir.', u'In the telegram, Amin "applauded the massacre of the Israeli Olympic athletes in Munich and said Germany was the most appropriate locale for this because it was where Hitler burned more than six million Jews."', u'Amin also called "to expel Israel from the United Nations and to send all the Israelis to Britain, which bore the guilt for creating the Jewish state."', u'Amidst international protest, "the UN spokesman said [in his daily press conference] it was not the secretary-general\'s practice to comment on telegrams sent him by heads of government.', u'He added that the secretary-general condemned any form of racial discrimination and genocide."', u'After Operation Entebbe on 7 July 1976 \u2014 where Israeli commandos freed more than 100 Israeli and Jewish passengers held captive in Entebbe Airport (Uganda\'s main airport) by Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and German Revolutionary Cells fighters protected by forces of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, and where all the hijackers, three hostages and 45 Ugandan soldiers were killed \u2014 Waldheim described the raid as a "serious violation of the national sovereignty of a United Nations member state".', u'Waldheim was appointed again in 1976 despite some opposition.', u'Waldheim and then-U.S. President Jimmy Carter both prepared written statements for inclusion on the Voyager Golden Records, now in deep space.', u'He was the first Secretary-General to visit North Korea, in 1979.', u'In 1980, Waldheim flew to Iran in an attempt to negotiate the release of the American hostages held in Tehran, but Ayatollah Khomeini refused to see him.', u"While in Tehran, it was announced that an attempt on Waldheim's life had been foiled.", u'Near the end of his tenure as Secretary-General, Waldheim and Paul McCartney organized a series of concerts for the People of Kampuchea to help Cambodia recover from the damage done by Pol Pot.', u"China vetoed Waldheim's candidature, and he was succeeded by Javier P\xe9rez de Cu\xe9llar of Peru.", u'== Presidency of Austria ==\n\n\n=== Election and Waldheim Affair ===\nWaldheim had unsuccessfully sought election as President of Austria in 1971, but his second attempt on 8 June 1986 proved successful.', u'During his campaign for the presidency in 1985, the events started that marked the beginning of what became known internationally as the "Waldheim affair".', u"Before the presidential elections, investigative journalist Alfred Worm revealed in the Austrian weekly news magazine Profil that there had been several omissions about Waldheim's life between 1938 and 1945 in his recently published autobiography.", u'A short time later, the World Jewish Congress alleged that Waldheim had lied about his service as an officer in the mounted corps of the SA, and his time as an ordnance officer for Army Group E in Saloniki, Greece, from 1942 to 1943 based on files from the United Nations War Crimes Commission.', u'Waldheim called the allegations "pure lies and malicious acts".', u'Nevertheless, he admitted that he had known about German reprisals against partisans: "Yes, I knew.', u'I was horrified.', u'But what could I do?', u'I had either to continue to serve or be executed."', u'He said that he had never fired a shot or even seen a partisan.', u'His former immediate superior at the time stated that Waldheim had "remained confined to a desk".', u'Former Austrian chancellor Bruno Kreisky, of Jewish origin, denounced the actions of the World Jewish Congress as an "extraordinary infamy", adding that Austrians would not "allow the Jews abroad to ... tell us who should be our President."', u"Part of the reason for the controversy was Austria's refusal to address its national role in the Holocaust.", u'(Many leading Nazis, including Adolf Hitler, were Austrians, and Austria became part of the Third Reich.)', u'Austria refused to pay compensation to Nazi victims, and from 1970 onwards refused to investigate Austrian citizens who were senior Nazis.', u'Stolen Jewish art remained public property until after the Waldheim affair.', u'Because the revelations leading to the Waldheim affair came shortly before the presidential election, there has been speculation about the background of the affair.', u'Declassified CIA documents show that the CIA had been aware of his wartime past since 1945.', u"Information about Waldheim's wartime past was also previously published by a pro-German Austrian newspaper, Salzburger Volksblatt, during the 1971 presidential election campaign, including the claim of an SS membership, but the matter was supposedly regarded as unimportant or even advantageous for the candidate at that time.", u'It has been asserted that his wartime past and the discrepancies in his autobiography, In the Eye of the Storm, must have been well-known to both superpowers before he was elected UN Secretary General, and there were rumours that the KGB had blackmailed him during his UN time (for example here and here).', u'In 1994, former Mossad officer Victor Ostrovsky claimed in his book The Other Side of Deception that Mossad doctored the file of the then UN Secretary General to implicate him in Nazi crimes.', u'These allegedly false documents were subsequently "discovered" by Benjamin Netanyahu in the UN file and triggered the "Waldheim Affair".', u"Ostrovsky says it was motivated by Waldheim's criticism of Israel's war in Lebanon.", u'Controversy surrounds Ostrovsky because many of his revelations have not been sourced or otherwise confirmed, leading several critics to say that most of his work (including TOSOD) is fictional.', u"Ostrovsky's service in Mossad was confirmed when the Israeli government unsuccessfully attempted to stop publication of the book.", u"=== The International Committee of Historians and allegations of Nazi war crimes ===\nIn view of the ongoing international controversy, the Austrian government decided to appoint an international committee of historians to examine Waldheim's life between 1938 and 1945.", u'Their report found no evidence of any personal involvement in those crimes.', u'Although Waldheim had stated that he was unaware of any crimes taking place, the committee cited evidence that Waldheim must have known about war crimes.', u'In response to Waldheim\'s denial that he knew about war crimes, Simon Wiesenthal stated that Waldheim was stationed 5 miles (8.0 km) from Salonika while, over the course of several weeks, the Jewish community, which formed one-third of the population there, was sent to Auschwitz:\n\nI could only reply what the committee of historians likewise made clear in its report: "I cannot believe you."', u'Wiesenthal stated the committee found no evidence that Waldheim took part in any war crimes but was guilty of lying about his military record.', u'The International Committee in February 1988 concluded that he could not stop what was going on in Yugoslavia and Greece even if he knew:\n\nIn favour of Waldheim is, that he only had very minor possibilities to act against the injustices happening.', u'Actions against these, depending on which level the resistance occurred, were of very different importance.', u'For a young member of the staff, who did not have any military authority on the army group level, the practical possibilities for resistance were very limited and with a high probability would not have led to any actual results.', u'Resistance would have been limited to a formal protest or on the refusal to serve any longer in the army, which would have seemed to be a courageous act, however would have not led to any practical achievement.', u'=== Foreign visits ===\nThroughout his term as President (1986\u20131992), Kurt Waldheim and his wife Elisabeth were officially deemed personae non gratae by the United States.', u'== Later years and death ==\n\nAfter his term ended in 1992, Waldheim did not seek re-election.', u'The same year, he was made an honorary member of K.H.V.', u'Welfia Klosterneuburg, a Roman Catholic student fraternity a part of the Austrian Cartellverband.', u'In 1994, Pope John Paul II awarded Waldheim a knighthood in the Order of Pius IX and his wife a papal honor.', u'He died on 14 June 2007, from heart failure.', u'On 23 June, his funeral was held at St. Stephen\'s Cathedral, Vienna, and he was buried at the Presidential Vault in the Zentralfriedhof ("central cemetery").', u'In his speech at the Cathedral, Federal President Heinz Fischer called Waldheim "a great Austrian" who had been wrongfully accused of having committed war crimes.', u'Fischer also praised Waldheim for his efforts to solve international crises and for his contributions to world peace.', u"At Waldheim's own request, no foreign heads of states or governments were invited to attend his funeral except Hans-Adam II, the Prince of Liechtenstein.", u'Also present was Luis Durnwalder, governor of the Italian province of South Tyrol.', u'Japan and Syria were the only two countries that laid wreaths on his grave.', u"Ban Ki-Moon, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, issued a message 'voicing sadness'.", u'In a two-page letter, published posthumously by the Austrian Press Agency the day after he died, Waldheim admitted making "mistakes" ("but these were certainly not those of a follower let alone an accomplice of a criminal regime") and asked his critics for forgiveness.', u"== Media references ==\nW. G. Sebald's novel The Rings of Saturn (1995; English trans., 1998) refers to Waldheim, though not by name.", u'As a much-heralded invited guest on Dame Edna Everage\'s talk show The Dame Edna Experience, a dignified "Kurt Waldheim" began a grand entrance, except that halfway down the staircase, he abruptly fell through a hidden chute and disappeared: the band\'s fanfare stopped as Dame Edna explained she had decided at the last minute to "abort" Dr. Waldheim\'s appearance because it would have been "too political".', u'The episode aired 12 September 1987.', u'A running segment on The Howard Stern Show is called Guess Who\'s the Jew and features Fred Norris portraying a Nazi Kurt Waldheim, Jr.\nMusician Lou Reed\'s 1989 New York album contains a song called "Good Evening Mr.', u'Waldheim."', u'Harry Turtledove\'s 2003 alternate history novel, In the Presence of Mine Enemies, in which Germany won the Second World War, a "Kurt Haldweim" is the third F\xfchrer of Germany, and parts of Haldweim\'s biography closely parallel Waldheim\'s.', u'For instance, both Waldheim and Haldweim were born in Austria in 1918 and served in the Wehrmacht in Salonica during World War II.', u'In a 1988 ice hockey film entitled Hockey, The Lighter Side, former New York Rangers goaltender John Davidson is explaining his fictional goaltender school, and as hockey highlights play, he exclaims, "You\'ll have more shots taken at you than Kurt Waldheim."', u'In episode 3, series 2 of The Million Pound Radio Show, Andy Hamilton announces next week\'s special guest as Waldheim, "although he\'ll deny [his appearance on the show] in 40 years time."', u'During the filming of Schindler\'s List, comedian Robin Williams cheered director Steven Spielberg with a spoof telemarketing call from "the Waldheimers Association, a society devoted to helping raise money to help older Germans who had forgotten everything before 1945."', u'In an episode of The New Statesman, aired in 1989, Alan B\'Stard (Rik Mayall) attempts to blackmail an aged former Nazi officer, who complains that, "it\'s not fair; I\'m living here in the tripe capital of Europe, while Kurt Waldheim is President of Austria \u2014 and he was beneath me!"', u"American poet Srikanth Reddy's 2011 book Voyager presents a collection of poems and fragments created by erasing large sections of Waldheim's memoir In the Eye of the Storm.", u'Graphic novel and film Persepolis (comics) by Marjane Satrapi reference the election in Austria.', u'In the 2015 fiction novel The Lady From Zagreb by Philip Kerr, the protagonist, Captain Bernie Gunther, encounters a young Intelligence Officer, Lieutenant Kurt Waldheim while on a mission in Yugoslavia in 1942.', u"In the 2015 film Woman in Gold, Hubertus Czernin shows Maria Altmann an issue of Profil uncovering Waldheim's Nazi past.", u'== Further reading ==\nBassett, Richard (1988).', u'Waldheim and Austria, Penguin Books.', u'ISBN 978-0-14-013019-5\nHerzstein, Robert Edwin (1988).', u'Waldheim, the Missing Years.', u'First ed.', u'New York: W.

union of multiple subnational Soviet republics, its government and economy were highly centralized.', u'The Soviet Union was a one-party federation, governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital.', u'The Soviet Union had its roots in the October Revolution of 1917, when the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, overthrew the provisional government that had replaced the Tsar.', u'They established the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic (renamed Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in 1936), beginning a civil war between the revolutionary "Reds" and the counter-revolutionary "Whites."', u'The Red Army entered several territories of the former Russian Empire and helped local Communists take power through soviets, which nominally acted on behalf of workers and peasants.', u'In 1922, the Communists were victorious, forming the Soviet Union with the unification of the Russian, Transcaucasian, Ukrainian, and Byelorussian republics.', u"Following Lenin's death in 1924, a troika and a brief power struggle, Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s.", u'Stalin suppressed all political opposition to his rule, committed the state ideology to Marxism\u2013Leninism (which he created), and initiated a centrally planned command economy.', u'As a result, the country underwent a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization which laid the foundation for its victory in World War II and post-war dominance of Eastern Europe.', u'Stalin also fomented political paranoia, and conducted the Great Purge to remove opponents of his from the Communist Party through the mass arbitrary arrest of many people (military leaders, Communist Party members, and ordinary citizens alike) who were then sent to correctional labor camps or sentenced to death.', u'Shortly before World War II, Stalin signed the non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany, after which the two countries invaded Poland in September 1939.', u'In June 1941 the Germans invaded, opening the largest and bloodiest theater of war in history.', u'Soviet war casualties accounted for the highest proportion of the conflict in the cost of acquiring the upper hand over Axis forces at intense battles such as Stalingrad.', u'Soviet forces eventually captured Berlin in 1945.', u'The territory overtaken by the Red Army became satellite states of the Eastern Bloc.', u'The Cold War emerged by 1947 as the Soviet bloc confronted the Western states that united in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1949.', u'Following Stalin\'s death in 1953, a period of political and economic liberalization, known as "de-Stalinization" and "Khrushchev\'s Thaw", occurred under the leadership of Nikita Khrushchev.', u'The country developed rapidly, as millions of peasants were moved into industrialized cities.', u'The USSR took an early lead in the Space Race with the first ever satellite and the first human spaceflight.', u'In the 1970s, there was a brief d\xe9tente of relations with the United States, but tensions resumed when the Soviet Union deployed troops in Afghanistan in 1979.', u'The war drained economic resources and was matched by an escalation of American military aid to Mujahideen fighters.', u'In the mid-1980s, the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, sought to further reform and liberalize the economy through his policies of glasnost and perestroika.', u'The goal was to preserve the Communist Party while reversing economic stagnation.', u'The Cold War ended during his tenure, and in 1989 Soviet satellite countries in Eastern Europe overthrew their respective communist regimes.', u'This led to the rise of strong nationalist and separatist movements inside the USSR as well.', u'Central authorities initiated a referendum\u2014boycotted by the Baltic republics, Armenia, Georgia, and Moldova\u2014which resulted in the majority of participating citizens voting in favor of preserving the Union as a renewed federation.', u"In August 1991, a coup d'\xe9tat was attempted by Communist Party hardliners.", u'It failed, with Russian President Boris Yeltsin playing a high-profile role in facing down the coup, resulting in the banning of the Communist Party.', u'On 25 December 1991, Gorbachev resigned and the remaining twelve constituent republics emerged from the dissolution of the Soviet Union as independent post-Soviet states.', u"The Russian Federation (formerly the Russian SFSR) assumed the Soviet Union's rights and obligations and has emerged as the recognized primary legal successor of the Soviet Union.", u'== Name ==\n\nThe word \u201cSoviet\u201d is derived from a Russian word meaning council, assembly, advice, harmony, concord, and all ultimately deriving from the Proto-Slavic verbal stem of *v\u011bt-iti "to inform", related to Slavic "v\u011bst" ("news"), English "wise", the root in "ad-vis-or" (which came to English through French), or the Dutch "weten" (to know; cf.', u'"wetenschap" = science).', u'The word "sovietnik" means councillor.', u'A number of organizations in Russian history were called "council" (Russian: \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0301\u0442).', u'For example, in the Russian Empire, the State Council, which functioned from 1810 to 1917, was referred to as a Council of Ministers after the revolt of 1905.', u'From the beginning, the Soviet Union was the called the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics from its founding, although all the republics began as Socialist Soviet and did not change to the other order until 1936.', u'In addition, in the national languages of several republics the word "Council/Conciliar" in the respective language was only quite late changed to an adaptation of the Russian "Soviet" - and never in others, e.g., Ukraine.', u'The names of the Soviet Union are as

"Russia" as well in some encyclopedic sources.', u"== Geography, climate and environment ==\n\nWith an area of 22,402,200 square kilometres (8,649,500 sq mi), the Soviet Union was the world's largest country, a status that is retained by the Russian Federation.", u"Covering a sixth of Earth's land surface, its size was comparable to that of North America.", u"The European portion accounted for a quarter of the country's area, and was the cultural and economic center.", u'The eastern part in Asia extended to the Pacific Ocean to the east and Afghanistan to the south, and, except some areas in Central Asia, was much less populous.', u'It spanned over 10,000 kilometres (6,200 mi) east to west across 11 time zones, and over 7,200 kilometres (4,500 mi) north to south.', u'It had five climate zones: tundra, taiga, steppes, desert, and mountains.', u"The Soviet Union had the world's longest border, like Russia, measuring over 60,000 kilometres (37,000 mi), or \u200a1 1\u20442 circumferences of Earth.", u'Two-thirds of it was a coastline.', u'Across the Bering Strait was the United States.', u'The Soviet Union bordered Afghanistan, China, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Hungary, Iran, Mongolia, North Korea, Norway, Poland, Romania, and Turkey from 1945 to 1991.', u"The Soviet Union's highest mountain was Communism Peak (now Ismoil Somoni Peak) in Tajikistan, at 7,495 metres (24,590 ft).", u"The Soviet Union also included most of the world's largest lake, the Caspian Sea (shared with Iran), and Lake Baikal, the world's largest freshwater and deepest lake, an internal body of water in Russia.", u'== History ==\n\nThe last Russian Tsar, Nicholas II, ruled the Russian Empire until his abdication in March 1917 in the aftermath of the February Revolution, due in part to the strain of fighting in World War I, which lacked public support.', u'A short-lived Russian Provisional Government took power, to be overthrown in the October Revolution (N.S.', u'7 November 1917) by revolutionaries led by the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin.', u'The Soviet Union was officially established in December 1922 with the union of the Russian, Ukrainian, Byelorussian, and Transcaucasian Soviet republics, each ruled by local Bolshevik parties.', u'Despite the foundation of the Soviet state as a federative entity of many constituent republics, each with its own political and administrative entities, the term "Soviet Russia" \u2013 strictly applicable only to the Russian Federative Socialist Republic \u2013 was often applied to the entire country by non-Soviet writers and politicians.', u'=== Revolution and foundation ===\n\nModern revolutionary activity in the Russian Empire began with the Decembrist revolt of 1825.', u'Although serfdom was abolished in 1861, it was done on terms unfavorable to the peasants and served to encourage revolutionaries.', u'A parliament\u2014the State Duma\u2014was established in 1906 after the Russian Revolution of 1905, but Tsar Nicholas II resisted attempts to move from absolute to constitutional monarchy.', u'Social unrest continued and was aggravated during World War I by military defeat and food shortages in major Soviet cities.', u"A spontaneous popular uprising in Petrograd, in response to the wartime decay of Russia's economy and morale, culminated in the February Revolution and the toppling of the imperial government in March 1917.", u'The tsarist autocracy was replaced by the Russian Provisional Government, which intended to conduct elections to the Russian Constituent Assembly and to continue fighting on the side of the Entente in World War I.', u'At the same time, workers\' councils, known in Russian as "Soviets", sprang up across the country.', u'The Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, pushed for socialist revolution in the Soviets and on the streets.', u'On 7 November 1917, the Red Guards stormed the Winter Palace in Petrograd, ending the rule of the Provisional Government and leaving all political power to the Soviets.', u'This event would later be known as the Great October Socialist Revolution.', u'In December, the Bolsheviks signed an armistice with the Central Powers, though by February 1918, fighting had resumed.', u'In March, the Soviets ended involvement in the war for good and signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.', u"A long and bloody Civil War ensued between the Reds and the Whites, starting in 1917 and ending in 1923 with the Reds' victory.", u'It included foreign intervention, the execution of the former tsar and his family, and the famine of 1921, which killed about five million people.', u'In March 1921, during a related conflict with Poland, the Peace of Riga was signed, splitting disputed territories in Belarus and Ukraine between the Republic of Poland and Soviet Russia.', u'Soviet Russia had to resolve similar conflicts with the newly established Republic of Finland, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia, and the Republic of Lithuania.', u'=== Unification of republics ===\n\nOn 28 December 1922, a conference of plenipotentiary delegations from the Russian SFSR, the Transcaucasian SFSR, the Ukrainian SSR and the Byelorussian SSR approved the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR and the Declaration of the Creation of the USSR, forming the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.', u'These two documents were confirmed by the 1st Congress of Soviets of the USSR and signed by the heads of the delegations, Mikhail Kalinin, Mikhail Tskhakaya, Mikhail Frunze, Grigory Petrovsky, and Alexander Chervyakov, on 30 December 1922.', u'The formal proclamation was made from the stage of the Bolshoi Theatre.', u'On 1 February 1924, the USSR was recognized by the British Empire.', u'The same year, a Soviet Constitution was approved, legitimizing the December 1922 union.', u'An intensive restructuring of the economy, industry and politics of the country began in the early days of Soviet power in 1917.', u'A large part of this was done according to the Bolshevik Initial Decrees, government documents signed by Vladimir Lenin.', u'One of the most prominent breakthroughs was the GOELRO plan, which envisioned a major restructuring of the Soviet economy based on total electrification of the country.', u'The plan was developed in 1920 and covered a 10 to 15-year period.', u'It included construction of a network of 30 regional power stations, including ten large hydroelectric power plants, and numerous electric-powered large industrial enterprises.', u'The plan became the prototype for subsequent Five-Year Plans and was fulfilled by 1931.', u'=== Stalin era ===\n\nFrom its creation, the government in the Soviet Union was based on the one-party rule of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks).', u'After the economic policy of "War communism" during the Russian Civil War, as a prelude to fully developing socialism in the country, the Soviet government permitted some private enterprise to coexist alongside nationalized industry in the 1920s and total food requisition in the countryside was replaced by a food tax.', u"The stated purpose of the one-party state was to ensure that capitalist exploitation would not return to the Soviet Union and that the principles of democratic centralism would be most effective in representing the people's will in a practical manner.", u"Debate over the future of the economy provided the background for a power struggle in the years after Lenin's death in 1924.", u'Initially, Lenin was to be replaced by a "troika" consisting of Grigory Zinoviev of the Ukrainian SSR, Lev Kamenev of the Russian SFSR, and Joseph Stalin of the Transcaucasian SFSR.', u'On 3 April 1922, Stalin was named the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.', u"Lenin had appointed Stalin the head of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate, which gave Stalin considerable power.", u'By gradually consolidating his influence and isolating and outmaneuvering his rivals within the party, Stalin became the undisputed leader of the Soviet Union and, by the end of the 1920s, established totalitarian rule.', u'In October 1927, Grigory Zinoviev and Leon Trotsky were expelled from the Central Committee and forced into exile.', u'In 1928, Stalin introduced the First Five-Year Plan for building a socialist economy.', u'In place of the internationalism expressed by Lenin throughout the Revolution, it aimed to build Socialism in One Country.', u'In industry, the state assumed control over all existing enterprises and undertook an intensive program of industrialization.', u'In agriculture, rather than adhering to the "lead by example" policy advocated by Lenin, forced collectivization of farms was implemented all over the country.', u'Famines ensued, causing millions of deaths; surviving kulaks were persecuted and many sent to Gulags to do forced labour.', u'Social upheaval continued in the mid-1930s.', u'Stalin\'s Great Purge resulted in the execution or detainment of many "Old Bolsheviks" who had participated in the October Revolution with Lenin.', u'According to declassified Soviet archives, in 1937 and 1938, the NKVD arrested more than one and a half million people, of whom 681,692 were shot.', u'Over those two years that averages to over one thousand executions a day.', u'According to historian Geoffrey Hosking, "...excess deaths during the 1930s as a whole were in the range of 10\u201311 million."', u'Yet despite the turmoil of the mid-to-late 1930s, the Soviet Union developed a powerful industrial economy in the years before World War II.', u'==== 1930s ====\n\nThe early 1930s saw closer cooperation between the West and the USSR.', u'From 1932 to 1934, the Soviet Union participated in the World Disarmament Conference.', u"In 1933, diplomatic relations between the United States and the USSR were established when in November, the newly elected President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt chose to formally recognize Stalin's Communist government and negotiated a new trade agreement between the two nations.", u'In September 1934, the Soviet Union joined the League of Nations.', u'After the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, the USSR actively supported the Republican forces against the Nationalists, who were supported by Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany.', u'In December 1936, Stalin unveiled a new Soviet Constitution.', u'The constitution was seen as a personal triumph for Stalin, who on this occasion was described by Pravda as a "genius of the new world, the wisest man of the epoch, the great leader of communism."', u'By contrast, Western historians and historians from former Soviet occupied countries have viewed the constitution as a meaningless propaganda document.', u'The late 1930s saw a shift towards the Axis powers.', u'In 1939, almost a year after the United Kingdom and France had concluded the Munich Agreement with Germany, the USSR dealt with the Nazis as well, both militarily and economically during extensive talks.', u'The two countries concluded the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact and the German\u2013Soviet Commercial Agreement in August 1939.', u'The nonaggression pact made possible Soviet occupation of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Bessarabia, northern Bukovina, and eastern Poland.', u'In late November of the same year, unable to coerce the Republic of Finland by diplomatic means into moving its border 25 kilometres (16 mi) back from Leningrad, Joseph Stalin ordered the invasion of Finland.', u'In the east, the Soviet military won several decisive victories during border clashes with the Empire of Japan in 1938 and 1939.', u'However, in April 1941, USSR signed the Soviet\u2013Japanese Neutrality Pact with the Empire of Japan, recognizing the territorial integrity of Manchukuo, a Japanese puppet state.', u'==== World War II ====\n\nAlthough it has been debated whether the Soviet Union intended to invade Germany once it was strong enough, Germany itself broke the treaty and invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, starting what was known in the USSR as the "Great Patriotic War".', u'The Red Army stopped the seemingly invincible German Army at the Battle of Moscow, aided by an unusually harsh winter.', u'The Battle of Stalingrad, which lasted from late 1942 to early 1943, dealt a severe blow to the Germans from which they never fully recovered and became a turning point in the war.', u'After Stalingrad, Soviet forces drove through Eastern Europe to Berlin before Germany surrendered in 1945.', u'The German Army suffered 80% of its military deaths in the Eastern Front.', u'The same year, the USSR, in fulfillment of its agreement with the Allies at the Yalta Conference, denounced the Soviet\u2013Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1945 and invaded Manchukuo and other Japan-controlled territories on 9 August 1945.', u'This conflict ended with a decisive Soviet victory, contributing to the unconditional surrender of Japan and the end of World War II.', u'The Soviet Union suffered greatly in the war, losing around 27 million people.', u'During the war, the Soviet Union together with the United States, the United Kingdom and China were considered as the Big Four of Allied powers in World War II  and later became the Four Policemen which was the foundation of the United Nations Security Council.', u'It emerged as a superpower in the post-war period.', u'Once denied diplomatic recognition by the Western world, the Soviet Union had official relations with practically every nation by the late 1940s.', u'A member of the United Nations at its foundation in 1945, the Soviet Union became one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, which gave it the right to veto any of its resolutions.', u"The Soviet Union maintained its status as one of the world's two superpowers for four decades through its hegemony in Eastern Europe, military strength, economic strength, aid to developing countries, and scientific research, especially in space technology and weaponry.", u'==== Cold War ====\n\nDuring the immediate postwar period, the Soviet Union rebuilt and expanded its economy, while maintaining its strictly centralized control.', u'It aided post-war reconstruction in the countries of Eastern Europe, while turning them into satellite states, binding them in a military alliance (the Warsaw Pact) in 1955, and an economic organization (The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance or Comecon) from 1949 to 1991, the latter a counterpart to the European Economic Community.', u'Later, the Comecon supplied aid to the eventually victorious Communist Party of China, and saw its influence grow elsewhere in the world.', u"Fearing its ambitions, the Soviet Union's wartime allies, the United Kingdom and the United States, became its enemies.", u'In the ensuing Cold War, the two sides clashed indirectly using mostly proxies.', u'=== Khrushchev era ===\n\nStalin died on 5 March 1953.', u'Without a mutually agreeable successor, the highest Communist Party officials initially opted to rule the Soviet Union jointly through a troika.', u'This did not last, however, and Nikita Khrushchev eventually won the power struggle by the mid-1950s.', u"He shortly aftwerward denounced Stalin's use of repression in 1956 and proceeded to ease Stalin's repressive controls over party and society.", u'This was known as de-Stalinization.', u'Because Moscow considered Eastern Europe to be a critically vital buffer zone for the forward defense of its western borders (in case of another major invasion such as the German invasion of 1940), the USSR sought to cement its control of the region by transforming the Eastern European countries into satellite states dependent upon and subservient to its leadership.', u'Soviet military force was used to suppress anti-Stalinist uprisings in Hungary and Poland in 1956.', u"In the late 1950s, a confrontation with China regarding the USSR's rapprochement with the West and what Mao Zedong perceived as Khrushchev's revisionism led to the Sino\u2013Soviet split.", u'This resulted in a break throughout the global Marxist\u2013Leninist movement, with the governments in Albania, Cambodia and Somalia choosing to ally with China in place of the USSR.', u'During this period of the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Soviet Union continued to realize scientific and technological exploits in the Space Race, rivaling the United States: launching the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1 in 1957; a living dog named Laika in 1957; the first human being, Yuri Gagarin in 1961; the first woman in space, Valentina Tereshkova in 1963; Alexey Leonov, the first person to walk in space in 1965; the first soft landing on the moon by spacecraft Luna 9 in 1966 and the first moon rovers, Lunokhod 1 and Lunokhod 2.', u'Khrushchev initiated "The Thaw", a complex shift in political, cultural and economic life in the Soviet Union.', u'This included some openness and contact with other nations and new social and economic policies with more emphasis on commodity goods, allowing living standards to rise dramatically while maintaining high levels of economic growth.', u'Censorship was relaxed as well.', u"Khrushchev's reforms in agriculture and administration, however, were generally unproductive.", u'In 1962, he precipitated a crisis with the United States over the Soviet deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba.', u'An agreement was made between the Soviet Union and the United States to remove enemy nuclear missiles from both Cuba and Turkey, concluding the crisis.', u'This event caused Khrushchev much embarrassment and loss of prestige, resulting in his removal from power in 1964.', u'=== Brezhnev era ===\n\nFollowing the ousting of Khrushchev, another period of collective leadership ensued, consisting of Leonid Brezhnev as General Secretary, Alexei Kosygin as Premier and Nikolai Podgorny as Chairman of the Presidium, lasting until Brezhnev established himself in the early 1970s as the preeminent Soviet leader.', u'In 1968, the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact allies invaded Czechoslovakia to halt the Prague Spring reforms.', u'In the aftermath, Brezhnev justified the invasion along with the earlier invasions of Eastern European states by introducing the Brezhnev Doctrine, which claimed the right of the Soviet Union to violate the sovereignty of any country that attempted to replace Marxism\u2013Leninism with capitalism.', u'Brezhnev presided over a period of d\xe9tente with the West that resulted in treaties on armament control (SALT I, SALT II, Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty) while at the same time building up Soviet military might.', u'In October 1977, the third Soviet Constitution was unanimously adopted.', u"The prevailing mood of the Soviet leadership at the time of Brezhnev's death in 1982 was one of aversion to change.", u'The long period of Brezhnev\'s rule had come to be dubbed one of "standstill", with an aging and ossified top political leadership.', u"=== Gorbachev era ===\n\nTwo developments dominated the decade that followed: the increasingly apparent crumbling of the Soviet Union's economic and political structures, and the patchwork attempts at reforms to reverse that process.", u"Kenneth S. Deffeyes argued in Beyond Oil that the Reagan administration encouraged Saudi Arabia to lower the price of oil to the point where the Soviets could not make a profit selling their oil, so that the USSR's hard currency reserves became depleted.", u"Brezhnev's next two successors, transitional figures with deep roots in his tradition, did not last long.", u'Yuri Andropov was 68 years old and Konstantin Chernenko 72 when they assumed power; both died in less than two years.', u'In an attempt to avoid a third short-lived leader, in 1985, the Soviets turned to the next generation and selected Mikhail Gorbachev.', u'Gorbachev made significant changes in the economy and party leadership, called perestroika.', u'His policy of glasnost freed public access to information after decades of heavy government censorship.', u'Gorbachev also moved to end the Cold War.', u'In 1988, the Soviet Union abandoned its nine-year war in Afghanistan and began to withdraw its forces.', u"In the late 1980s, he refused military support to the Soviet Union's former satellite states, which paved the way for Revolutions of 1989.", u'With the tearing down of the Berlin Wall and with East Germany and West Germany pursuing unification, the Iron Curtain came down.', u'In the late 1980s, the constituent republics of the Soviet Union started legal moves towards potentially declaring sovereignty over their territories, citing Article 72 of the USSR constitution, which stated that any constituent republic was free to secede.', u'On 7 April 1990, a law was passed allowing a republic to secede if more than two-thirds of its residents voted for it in a referendum.', u'Many held their first free elections in the Soviet era for their own national legislatures in 1990.', u'Many of these legislatures proceeded to produce legislation contradicting the Union laws in what was known as the "War of Laws".', u"In 1989, the Russian SFSR, which was then the largest constituent republic (with about half of the population) convened a newly elected Congress of People's Deputies.", u'Boris Yeltsin was elected its chairman.', u"On 12 June 1990, the Congress declared Russia's sovereignty over its territory and proceeded to pass laws that attempted to supersede some of the USSR's laws.", u'After a landslide victory of S\u0105j\u016bdis in Lithuania, that country declared its independence restored on 11 March 1990.', u'A referendum for the preservation of the USSR was held on 17 March 1991 in nine republics (the remainder having boycotted the vote), with the majority of the population in those nine republics voting for preservation of the Union.', u'The referendum gave Gorbachev a minor boost.', u'In the summer of 1991, the New Union Treaty, which would have turned the Soviet Union into a much looser Union, was agreed upon by eight republics.', u"The signing of the treaty, however, was interrupted by the August Coup\u2014an attempted coup d'\xe9tat by hardline members of the government and the KGB who sought to reverse Gorbachev's reforms and reassert the central government's control over the republics.", u"After the coup collapsed, Yeltsin was seen as a hero for his decisive actions, while Gorbachev's power was effectively ended.", u'The balance of power tipped significantly towards the republics.', u"In August 1991, Latvia and Estonia immediately declared the restoration of their full independence (following Lithuania's 1990 example).", u"Gorbachev resigned as general secretary in late August, and soon afterward the Party's activities were indefinitely suspended\u2014effectively ending its rule.", u'By the fall, Gorbachev could no longer influence events outside of Moscow, and he was being challenged even there by Yeltsin, who had been elected President of Russia in July 1991.', u'=== Dissolution ===\n\nThe remaining 12 republics continued discussing new, increasingly looser, models of the Union.', u'However, by December, all except Russia and Kazakhstan had formally declared independence.', u'During this time, Yeltsin took over what remained of the Soviet government, including the Moscow Kremlin.', u'The final blow was struck on 1 December, when Ukraine, the second most powerful republic, voted overwhelmingly for independence.', u"Ukraine's secession ended any realistic chance of the Soviet Union staying together even on a limited scale.", u'On 8 December 1991, the presidents of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus (formerly Byelorussia), signed the Belavezha Accords, which declared the Soviet Union dissolved and established the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in its place.', u'While doubts remained over the authority of the accords to do this, on 21 December 1991, the representatives of all Soviet republics except Georgia signed the Alma-Ata Protocol, which confirmed the accords.', u'On 25 December 1991, Gorbachev resigned as the President of the USSR, declaring the office extinct.', u'He turned the powers that had been vested in the presidency over to Yeltsin.', u'That night, the Soviet flag was lowered for the last time, and the Russian tricolor was raised in its place.', u'The following day, the Supreme Soviet, the highest governmental body of the Soviet Union, voted both itself and the Soviet Union out of existence.', u'This is generally recognized as marking the official, final dissolution of the Soviet Union as a functioning state.', u'The Soviet Army originally remained under overall CIS command, but was soon absorbed into the different military forces of the newly independent states.', u'The few remaining Soviet institutions that had not been taken over by Russia ceased to function by the end of 1991.', u'Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991, Russia was internationally recognized as its legal successor on the international stage.', u'To that end, Russia voluntarily accepted all Soviet foreign debt and claimed overseas Soviet properties as its own.', u'Under the 1992 Lisbon Protocol, Russia also agreed to receive all nuclear weapons remaining in the territory of other former Soviet republics.', u"Since then, the Russian Federation has assumed the Soviet Union's rights and obligations.", u'Ukraine has refused to recognize exclusive Russian claims to succession of the USSR and claimed such status for Ukraine as well, which was codified in Articles 7 and 8 of its 1991 law On Legal Succession of Ukraine.', u'Since its independence in 1991 Ukraine has continued to pursue claims against Russia in foreign courts, seeking to recover its share of the foreign property that was owned by the Soviet Union.', u'The dissolution of the Soviet Union was followed by a severe economic contraction and catastrophic fall in living standards in post-Soviet states including a rapid increase in poverty, crime, corruption, unemployment, homelessness, rates of disease, and income inequality, along with decreases in calorie intake, life expectancy, adult literacy, and income.', u'The economic shocks that accompanied wholesale privatization were associated with sharp increases in mortality.', u'Data shows Russia, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia saw a tripling of unemployment and a 42% increase in male death rates between 1991 and 1994.', u'In summing up the international ramifications of these events, Vladislav Zubok stated: "The collapse of the Soviet empire was an event of epochal geopolitical, military, ideological, and economic significance. "', u'=== Post-Soviet states ===\n\nThe analysis of the succession of states with respect to the 15 post-Soviet states is complex.', u'The Russian Federation is seen as the legal continuator state and is for most purposes the heir to the Soviet Union.', u'It retained ownership of all former Soviet embassy properties, as well as the old Soviet UN membership and permanent membership on the Security Council.', u'The Baltic states are not successor states to the Soviet Union; they are instead considered to have de jure continuity with their pre-World War II governments through the non-recognition of the original Soviet incorporation in 1940.', u'The other 11 post-Soviet states are considered newly-independent successor states to the Soviet Union.', u'There are additionally four states that claim independence from the other internationally recognized post-Soviet states, but possess limited international recognition: Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh, South Ossetia, and Transnistria.', u'The Chechen separatist movement of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria lacks any international recognition.', u'== Politics ==\n\nThere were three power hierarchies in the Soviet Union: the legislature represented by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the government represented by the Council of Ministers, and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), the only legal party and the ultimate policymaker in the country.', u'=== Communist Party ===\n\nAt the top of the Communist Party was the Central Committee, elected at Party Congresses and Conferences.', u'The Central Committee in turn voted for a Politburo (called the Presidium between 1952\u20131966), Secretariat and the General Secretary (First Secretary from 1953 to 1966), the de facto highest office in the USSR.', u'Depending on the degree of power consolidation, it was either the Politburo as a collective body or the General Secretary, who always was one of the Politburo members, that effectively led the party and the country (except for the period of the highly personalized authority of Stalin, exercised directly through his position in the Council of Ministers rather than the Politburo after 1941).', u'They were not controlled by the general party membership, as the key principle of the party organization was democratic centralism, demanding strict subordination to higher bodies, and elections went uncontested, endorsing the candidates proposed from above.', u'The Communist Party maintained its dominance over the state largely through its control over the system of appointments.', u'All senior government officials and most deputies of the Supreme Soviet were members of the CPSU.', u'Of the party heads themselves, Stalin in 1941\u20131953 and Khrushchev in 1958\u20131964 were Premiers.', u'Upon the forced retirement of Khrushchev, the party leader was prohibited from this kind of double membership, but the later General Secretaries for at least some part of their tenure occupied the largely ceremonial position of Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the nominal head of state.', u'The institutions at lower levels were overseen and at times supplanted by primary party organizations.', u'In practice, however, the degree of control the party was able to exercise over the state bureaucracy, particularly after the death of Stalin, was far from total, with the bureaucracy pursuing different interests that were at times in conflict with the party.', u'Nor was the party itself monolithic from top to bottom, although factions were officially banned.', u'=== Government ===\n\nThe Supreme Soviet (successor of the Congress of Soviets and Central Executive Committee) was nominally the highest state body for most of the Soviet history, at first acting as a rubber stamp institution, approving and implementing all decisions made by the party.', u'However, the powers and functions of the Supreme Soviet were extended in the late 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, including the creation of new state commissions and committees.', u'It gained additional powers relating to the approval of the Five-Year Plans and the Soviet government budget.', u"The Supreme Soviet elected a Presidium to wield its power between plenary sessions, ordinarily held twice a year, and appointed the Supreme Court, the Procurator General and the Council of Ministers (known before 1946 as the Council of People's Commissars), headed by the Chairman (Premier) and managing an enormous bureaucracy responsible for the administration of the economy and society.", u'State and party structures of the constituent republics largely emulated the structure of the central institutions, although the Russian SFSR, unlike the other constituent republics, for most of its history had no republican branch of the CPSU, being ruled directly by the union-wide party until 1990.', u'Local authorities were organized likewise into party committees, local Soviets and executive committees.', u'While the state system was nominally federal, the party was unitary.', u'The state security police (the KGB and its predecessor agencies) played an important role in Soviet politics.', u'It was instrumental in the Stalinist terror, but after the death of Stalin, the state security police was brought under strict party control.', u'Under Yuri Andropov, KGB chairman in 1967\u20131982 and General Secretary from 1982 to 1983, the KGB engaged in the suppression of political dissent and maintained an extensive network of informers, reasserting itself as a political actor to some extent independent of the party-state structure, culminating in the anti-corruption campaign targeting high party officials in the late 1970s and early 1980s.', u'=== Separation of power and reform ===\n\nThe Union constitutions, which were promulgated in 1918, 1924, 1936 and 1977, did not limit state power.', u'No formal separation of powers existed between the Party, Supreme Soviet and Council of Ministers that represented executive and legislative branches of the government.', u'The system was governed less by statute than by informal conventions, and no settled mechanism of leadership succession existed.', u"Bitter and at times deadly power struggles took place in the Politburo after the deaths of Lenin and Joseph Stalin, as well as after Khrushchev's dismissal, itself due to a decision by both the Politburo and the Central Committee.", u'All leaders of the Communist Party before Gorbachev died in office, except Georgy Malenkov and Khrushchev, both dismissed from the party leadership amid internal struggle within the party.', u'Between 1988 and 1990, facing considerable opposition, Mikhail Gorbachev enacted reforms shifting power away from the highest bodies of the party and making the Supreme Soviet less dependent on them.', u"The Congress of People's Deputies was established, the majority of whose members were directly elected in competitive elections held in March 1989.", u'The Congress now elected the Supreme Soviet, which became a full-time parliament, much stronger than before.', u'For the first time since the 1920s, it refused to rubber stamp proposals from the party and Council of Ministers.', u'In 1990, Gorbachev introduced and assumed the position of the President of the Soviet Union, concentrated power in his executive office, independent of the party, and subordinated the government, now renamed the Cabinet of Ministers of the USSR, to himself.', u'Tensions grew between the union-wide authorities under Gorbachev, reformists led in Russia by Boris Yeltsin and controlling the newly elected Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR, and Communist Party hardliners.', u'On 19\u201321 August 1991, a group of hardliners staged an abortive coup attempt.', u'Following the failed coup, the State Council of the Soviet Union became the highest organ of state power "in the period of transition".', u'Gorbachev resigned as General Secretary, only remaining President for the final months of the existence of the USSR.', u'=== Judicial system ===\n\nThe judiciary was not independent of the other branches of government.', u"The Supreme Court supervised the lower courts (People's Court) and applied the law as established by the Constitution or as interpreted by the Supreme Soviet.", u'The Constitutional Oversight Committee reviewed the constitutionality of laws and acts.', u'The Soviet Union used the inquisitorial system of Roman law, where the judge, procurator, and defense attorney collaborate to establish the truth.', u'== Administrative divisions ==\n\nConstitutionally, the USSR was a federation of constituent Union Republics, which were either unitary states, such as Ukraine or Byelorussia (SSRs), or federal states, such as Russia or Transcaucasia (SFSRs), all four being the founding republics who signed the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR in December 1922.', u"In 1924, during the national delimitation in Central Asia, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan were formed from parts of the Russia's Turkestan ASSR and two Soviet dependencies, the Khorezm and Bukharan SSRs.", u'In 1929, Tajikistan was split off from the Uzbekistan.', u'With the constitution of 1936, the Transcaucasian SFSR was dissolved, resulting in its constituent republics of Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan being elevated to Union Republics, while Kazakhstan and Kirghizia were split off from Russian SFSR, resulting in the same status.', u'In August 1940, Moldavia was formed from parts of the Ukraine and Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina.', u'Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania (SSRs) were also admitted into the union which was not recognized by most of the international community and was considered an illegal occupation.', u'Karelia was split off from Russia as a Union Republic in March 1940 and was reabsorbed in 1956.', u'Between July 1956 and September 1991, there were 15 union republics (see map below).', u'While nominally a union of equals, in practice the Soviet Union was dominated by the Russian SFSR\u2014to such an extent that for most of the Soviet Union\'s existence, it was commonly (but incorrectly) referred to as "Russia."', u'While the RSFSR was technically only one republic within the larger union, it was by far the largest (both in terms of population and geography), most powerful, and most highly developed.', u'Historian Matthew White wrote that it was an open secret that the Soviet Union\'s federal structure was "window dressing" for Russian dominance.', u'For that reason, the people of the Soviet Union were usually called "Russians," not "Soviets," since "everyone knew who really ran the show."', u'== Economy ==\n\nThe Soviet Union became the first country to adopt a planned economy, whereby production and distribution of goods were centralized and directed by the government.', u'The first Bolshevik experience with a command economy was the policy of War communism, which involved the nationalization of industry, centralized distribution of output, coercive requisition of agricultural production, and attempts to eliminate the circulation of money, as well as private enterprises and free trade.', u'After the severe economic collapse caused by the war, Lenin replaced War Communism with the New Economic Policy (NEP) in 1921, legalising free trade and private ownership of smaller businesses.', u'The economy quickly recovered.', u'Following a lengthy debate among the members of Politburo over the course of economic development, by 1928\u20131929, upon gaining control of the country, Joseph Stalin abandoned the NEP and pushed for full central planning, starting forced collectivization of agriculture and enacting draconian labor legislation.', u'Resources were mobilized for rapid industrialization, which greatly expanded Soviet capacity in heavy industry and capital goods during the 1930s.', u'Preparation for war was one of the main driving forces behind industrialization, mostly due to distrust of the outside capitalistic world.', u'As a result, the USSR was transformed from a largely agrarian economy into a great industrial power, leading the way for its emergence as a superpower after World War II.', u'During the war, the Soviet economy and infrastructure suffered massive devastation and required extensive reconstruction.', u'By the early 1940s, the Soviet economy had become relatively self-sufficient; for most of the period until the creation of Comecon, only a very small share of domestic products was traded internationally.', u'After the creation of the Eastern Bloc, external trade rose rapidly.', u'Still the influence of the world economy on the USSR was limited by fixed domestic prices and a state monopoly on foreign trade.', u'Grain and sophisticated consumer manufactures became major import articles from around the 1960s.', u'During the arms race of the Cold War, the Soviet economy was burdened by military expenditures, heavily lobbied for by a powerful bureaucracy dependent on the arms industry.', u'At the same time, the Soviet Union became the largest arms exporter to the Third World.', u'Significant amounts of Soviet resources during the Cold War were allocated in aid to the other socialist states.', u'From the 1930s until its dissolution in late 1991, the way the Soviet economy operated remained essentially unchanged.', u'The economy was formally directed by central planning, carried out by Gosplan and organized in five-year plans.', u'In practice, however, the plans were highly aggregated and provisional, subject to ad hoc intervention by superiors.', u'All key economic decisions were taken by the political leadership.', u'Allocated resources and plan targets were normally denominated in rubles rather than in physical goods.', u'Credit was discouraged, but widespread.', u'Final allocation of output was achieved through relatively decentralized, unplanned contracting.', u'Although in theory prices were legally set from above, in practice the actual prices were often negotiated, and informal horizontal links (between producer factories etc.)', u'were widespread.', u'A number of basic services were state-funded, such as education and healthcare.', u'In the manufacturing sector, heavy industry and defense were assigned higher priority than the production of consumer goods.', u'Consumer goods, particularly outside large cities, were often scarce, of poor quality and limited choice.', u'Under command economy, consumers had almost no influence over production, so the changing demands of a population with growing incomes could not be satisfied by supplies at rigidly fixed prices.', u'A massive unplanned second economy grew up alongside the planned one at low levels, providing some of the goods and services that the planners could not.', u'Legalization of some elements of the decentralized economy was attempted with the reform of 1965.', u'Although statistics of the Soviet economy are notoriously unreliable and its economic growth difficult to estimate precisely, by most accounts, the economy continued to expand until the mid-1980s.', u'During the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet economy experienced comparatively high growth and was catching up to the West.', u'However, after 1970, the growth, while still positive, steadily declined much more quickly and consistently than in other countries despite a rapid increase in the capital stock (the rate of increase in capital was only surpassed by Japan).', u'Overall, between 1960 and 1989, the growth rate of per capita income in the Soviet Union was slightly above the world average (based on 102 countries).', u'According to Stanley Fischer and William Easterly, growth could have been faster.', u'By their calculation, per capita income of Soviet Union in 1989 should have been twice as high as it was considering the amount of investment, education and population.', u'The authors attribute this poor performance to low productivity of capital in the Soviet Union.', u"Steven Rosenfielde states that the standard of living actually declined as a result of Stalin's despotism, and while there was a brief improvement following his death, lapsed into stagnation.", u'In 1987, Mikhail Gorbachev tried to reform and revitalize the economy with his program of perestroika.', u'His policies relaxed state control over enterprises, but did not yet allow it to be replaced by market incentives, ultimately resulting in a sharp decline in production output.', u'The economy, already suffering from reduced petroleum export revenues, started to collapse.', u'Prices were still fixed, and property was still largely state-owned until after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.', u'For most of the period after World War II up to its collapse, the Soviet economy was the second largest in the world by GDP (PPP), and was 3rd in the world during the middle of the 1980s to 1989, though in per capita terms the Soviet GDP was behind that of the First World countries.', u'When compared to countries who had a similar GDP per capita to the Soviet Union in 1928, the Soviets experienced significant growth.', u'In 1990, the Soviet Union had a Human Development Index of 0.920, placing them in the "high" category of human development.', u'They had the third highest in the Eastern Bloc, behind Czechoslovakia and East Germany, and the twenty-fifth highest in the world out of one hundred-thirty countries in total.', u'=== Energy ===\n\nThe need for fuel declined in the Soviet Union from the 1970s to the 1980s, both per ruble of gross social product and per ruble of industrial product.', u'At the start, this decline grew very rapidly but gradually slowed down between 1970 and 1975.', u'From 1975 and 1980, it grew even slower, only 2.6 percent.', u'David Wilson, a historian, believed that the gas industry would account for 40 percent of Soviet fuel production by the end of the century.', u"His theory did not come to fruition because of the USSR's collapse.", u'The USSR, in theory, would have continued to have an economic growth rate of 2\u20132.5 percent during the 1990s because of Soviet energy fields.', u"However, the energy sector faced many difficulties, among them the country's high military expenditure and hostile relations with the First World (pre-Gorbachev era).", u'In 1991, the Soviet Union had a pipeline network of 82,000 kilometres (51,000 mi) for crude oil and another 206,500 kilometres (128,300 mi) for natural gas.', u'Petroleum and petroleum-based products, natural gas, metals, wood, agricultural products, and a variety of manufactured goods, primarily machinery, arms and military equipment, were exported.', u'In the 1970s and 1980s, the Soviet Union heavily relied on fossil fuel exports to earn hard currency.', u'At its peak in 1988, it was the largest producer and second largest exporter of crude oil, surpassed only by Saudi Arabia.', u"=== Science and technology ===\n\nThe Soviet Union placed great emphasis on science and technology within its economy, however, the most remarkable Soviet successes in technology, such as producing the world's first space satellite, typically were the responsibility of the military.", u'Lenin believed that the USSR would never overtake the developed world if it remained as technologically backward as it was upon its founding.', u"Soviet authorities proved their commitment to Lenin's belief by developing massive networks, research and development organizations.", u'In the early 1960s, the Soviets awarded 40% of chemistry PhDs to women, compared to only 5% who received such a degree in the United States.', u"By 1989, Soviet scientists were among the world's best-trained specialists in several areas, such as energy physics, selected areas of medicine, mathematics, welding and military technologies.", u'Due to rigid state planning and bureaucracy, the Soviets remained far behind technologically in chemistry, biology, and computers when compared to the First World.', u'Project Socrates, under the Reagan administration, determined that the Soviet Union addressed the acquisition of science and technology in a manner that was radically different from what the US was using.', u'In the case of the US, economic prioritization was being used for indigenous research and development as the means to acquire science and technology in both the private and public sectors.', u'In contrast, the Soviet Union was offensively and defensively maneuvering in the acquisition and utilization of the worldwide technology, to increase the competitive advantage that they acquired from the technology, while preventing the US from acquiring a competitive advantage.', u"However, in addition, the Soviet Union's technology-based planning was executed in a centralized, government-centric manner that greatly hindered its flexibility.", u'It was this significant lack of flexibility that was exploited by the US to undermine the strength of the Soviet Union and thus foster its reform.', u"=== Transport ===\n\nTransport was a key component of the nation's economy.", u'The economic centralization of the late 1920s and 1930s led to the development of infrastructure on a massive scale, most notably the establishment of Aeroflot, an aviation enterprise.', u'The country had a wide variety of modes of transport by land, water and air.', u'However, due to bad maintenance, much of the road, water and Soviet civil aviation transport were outdated and technologically backward compared to the First World.', u'Soviet rail transport was the largest and most intensively used in the world; it was also better developed than most of its Western counterparts.', u'By the late 1970s and early 1980s, Soviet economists were calling for the construction of more roads to alleviate some of the burden from the railways and to improve the Soviet government budget.', u'The street network and automotive industry remained underdeveloped, and dirt roads were common outside major cities.', u'Soviet maintenance projects proved unable to take care of even the few roads the country had.', u'By the early-to-mid-1980s, the Soviet authorities tried to solve the road problem by ordering the construction of new ones.', u'Meanwhile, the automobile industry was growing at a faster rate than road construction.', u'The underdeveloped road network led to a growing demand for public transport.', u'Despite improvements, several aspects of the transport sector were still riddled with problems due to outdated infrastructure, lack of investment, corruption and bad decision-making.', u'Soviet authorities were unable to meet the growing demand for transport infrastructure and services.', u'The Soviet merchant navy was one of the largest in the world.', u'== Demographics ==\n\nExcess deaths over the course of World War I and the Russian Civil War (including the postwar famine) amounted to a combined total of 18 million, some 10 million in the 1930s, and more than 26 million in 1941\u20135.', u'The postwar Soviet population was 45 to 50 million smaller than it would have been if pre-war demographic growth had continued.', u'According to Catherine Merridale, "... reasonable estimate would place the total number of excess deaths for the whole period somewhere around 60 million."', u'The birth rate of the USSR decreased from 44.0 per thousand in 1926 to 18.0 in 1974, largely due to increasing urbanization and the rising average age of marriages.', u'The mortality rate demonstrated a gradual decrease as well \u2013 from 23.7 per thousand in 1926 to 8.7 in 1974.', u'In general, the birth rates of the southern republics in Transcaucasia and Central Asia were considerably higher than those in the northern parts of the Soviet Union, and in some cases even increased in the post\u2013World War II period, a phenomenon partly attributed to slower rates of urbanization and traditionally earlier marriages in the southern republics.', u'Soviet Europe moved towards sub-replacement fertility, while Soviet Central Asia continued to exhibit population growth well above replacement-level fertility.', u'The late 1960s and the 1970s witnessed a reversal of the declining trajectory of the rate of mortality in the USSR, and was especially notable among men of working age, but was also prevalent in Russia and other predominantly Slavic areas of the country.', u'An analysis of the official data from the late 1980s showed that after worsening in the late-1970s and the early 1980s, adult mortality began to improve again.', u'The infant mortality rate increased from 24.7 in 1970 to 27.9 in 1974.', u'Some researchers regarded the rise as largely real, a consequence of worsening health conditions and services.', u'The rises in both adult and infant mortality were not explained or defended by Soviet officials, and the Soviet government simply stopped publishing all mortality statistics for ten years.', u'Soviet demographers and health specialists remained silent about the mortality increases until the late-1980s, when the publication of mortality data resumed and researchers could delve into the real causes.', u'=== Education ===\n\nBefore 1917, education was not free in the Russian Empire and was therefore either inaccessible or barely accessible for many children from lower-class working and peasant families.', u'Estimates from 1917 recorded that 75\u201385 percent of the Russian population was illiterate.', u"Anatoly Lunacharsky became the first People's Commissar for Education of Soviet Russia.", u'At the beginning, the Soviet authorities placed great emphasis on the elimination of illiteracy.', u'People who were literate were automatically hired as teachers.', u'For a short period, quality was sacrificed for quantity.', u'By 1940, Joseph Stalin could announce that illiteracy had been eliminated.', u'Throughout the 1930s social mobility rose sharply, which has been attributed to Soviet reforms in education.', u"In the aftermath of the Great Patriotic War, the country's educational system expanded dramatically.", u'This expansion had a tremendous effect.', u'In the 1960s, nearly all Soviet children had access to education, the only exception being those living in remote areas.', u'Nikita Khrushchev tried to make education more accessible, making it clear to children that education was closely linked to the needs of society.', u'Education also became important in giving rise to the New Man.', u'Citizens directly entering the work force had the constitutional right to a job and to free vocational training.', u"The country's system of education was highly centralized and universally accessible to all citizens, with affirmative action for applicants from nations associated with cultural backwardness.", u'However, as part of the general antisemitic policy, an unofficial Jewish quota was applied in the leading institutions of higher education by subjecting Jewish applicants to harsher entrance examinations.', u'The Brezhnev era also introduced a rule that required all university applicants to present a reference from the local Komsomol party secretary.', u'According to statistics from 1986, the number of higher education students per the population of 10,000 was 181 for the USSR, compared to 517 for the U.S.\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nThe Soviet Union was a very ethnically diverse country, with more than 100 distinct ethnic groups.', u'The total population was estimated at 293 million in 1991.', u'According to a 1990 estimate, the majority were Russians (50.78%), followed by Ukrainians (15.45%) and Uzbeks (5.84%).', u'All citizens of the USSR had their own ethnic affiliation.', u"The ethnicity of a person was chosen at the age of sixteen by the child's parents.", u'If the parents did not agree, the child was automatically assigned the ethnicity of the father.', u'Partly due to Soviet policies, some of the smaller minority ethnic groups were considered part of larger ones, such as the Mingrelians of Georgia, who were classified with the linguistically related Georgians.', u'Some ethnic groups voluntarily assimilated, while others were brought in by force.', u'Russians, Belarusians, and Ukrainians shared close cultural ties, while other groups did not.', u'With multiple nationalities living in the same territory, ethnic antagonisms developed over the years.', u'=== Health ===\n\nIn 1917, before the revolution, health conditions were significantly behind those of developed countries.', u'As Lenin later noted, "Either the lice will defeat socialism, or socialism will defeat the lice".', u"The Soviet principle of health care was conceived by the People's Commissariat for Health in 1918.", u'Health care was to be controlled by the state and would be provided to its citizens free of charge, this at the time being a revolutionary concept.', u'Article 42 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution gave all citizens the right to health protection and free access to any health institutions in the USSR.', u'Before Leonid Brezhnev became General Secretary, the healthcare system of the Soviet Union was held in high esteem by many foreign specialists.', u"This changed however, from Brezhnev's accession and Mikhail Gorbachev's tenure as leader, the Soviet health care system was heavily criticized for many basic faults, such as the quality of service and the unevenness in its provision.", u"Minister of Health Yevgeniy Chazov, during the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, while highlighting such Soviet successes as having the most doctors and hospitals in the world, recognized the system's areas for improvement and felt that billions of Soviet rubles were squandered.", u'After the socialist revolution, the life expectancy for all age groups went up.', u'This statistic in itself was seen by some that the socialist system was superior to the capitalist system.', u'These improvements continued into the 1960s, when the life expectancy in the Soviet Union surpassed that of the United States.', u'It remained stable during most years, although in the 1970s, it went down slightly, possibly because of alcohol abuse.', u'At the same time, infant mortality began to rise.', u'After 1974, the government stopped publishing statistics on this.', u'This trend can be partly explained by the number of pregnancies rising drastically in the Asian part of the country where infant mortality was highest, while declining markedly in the more developed European part of the Soviet Union.', u'The USSR had several centers of excellence, such as the Fyodorov Eye Microsurgery Complex, founded in 1988 by Russian eye surgeon Svyatoslav Fyodorov.', u'=== Language ===\n\nThe Soviet government headed by Vladimir Lenin gave small language groups their own writing systems.', u'The development of these writing systems was very successful, even though some flaws were detected.', u'During the later days of the USSR, countries with the same multilingual situation implemented similar policies.', u'A serious problem when creating these writing systems was that the languages differed dialectally greatly from each other.', u'When a language had been given a writing system and appeared in a notable publication, that language would attain "official language" status.', u'There were many minority languages which never received their own writing system; therefore their speakers were forced to have a second language.', u"There are examples where the Soviet government retreated from this policy, most notable under Stalin's regime, where education was discontinued in languages which were not widespread enough.", u'These languages were then assimilated into another language, mostly Russian.', u'During the Great Patriotic War, some minority languages were banned, and their speakers accused of collaborating with the enemy.', u'As the most widely spoken of the Soviet Union\'s many languages, Russian de facto functioned as an official language, as the "language of interethnic communication" (Russian: \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a \u043c\u0435\u0436\u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f), but only assumed the de jure status as the official national language in 1990.', u'=== Religion ===\n\nThe religious made up a significant minority of the Soviet Union prior to break up.', u'In 1990, the religious makeup was 20% Russian Orthodox, 10% Muslim, 7% Protestant, Armenian Apostolic, Georgian Orthodox, and Roman Catholic, less than 1% Jewish and 60% atheist.', u"Christianity and Islam had the greatest number of adherents among the Soviet state's religious citizens.", u"Eastern Christianity predominated among Christians, with Russia's traditional Russian Orthodox Church being the Soviet Union's largest Christian denomination.", u"About 90 percent of the Soviet Union's Muslims were Sunnis, with Shias concentrated in Azerbaijan.", u'Smaller groups included Roman Catholics, Jews, Buddhists, and a variety of Protestant sects.', u'Religious influence had been strong in the Russian Empire.', u'The Russian Orthodox Church enjoyed a privileged status as the church of the monarchy and took part in carrying out official state functions.', u'The immediate period following the establishment of the Soviet state included a struggle against the Orthodox Church, which the revolutionaries considered an ally of the former ruling classes.', u'In Soviet law, the "freedom to hold religious services" was constitutionally guaranteed, although the ruling Communist Party regarded religion as incompatible with the Marxist spirit of scientific materialism.', u'In practice, the Soviet system subscribed to a narrow interpretation of this right, and in fact utilized a range of official measures to discourage religion and curb the activities of religious groups.', u'The 1918 Council of People\'s Commissars decree establishing the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) as a secular state also decreed that "the teaching of religion in all [places] where subjects of general instruction are taught, is forbidden.', u'Citizens may teach and may be taught religion privately."', u"Among further restrictions, those adopted in 1929, a half-decade into Stalin's rule, included express prohibitions on a range of church activities, including meetings for organized Bible study.", u'Both Christian and non-Christian establishments were shut down by the thousands in the 1920s and 1930s.', u'By 1940, as many as 90 percent of the churches, synagogues, and mosques that had been operating in 1917 were closed.', u'Convinced that religious anti-Sovietism had become a thing of the past with most Soviet Christians, and with the looming threat of war, the Stalin regime began shifting to a more moderate religion policy in the late 1930s.', u'Soviet religious establishments overwhelmingly rallied to support the war effort during the Soviet war with Nazi Germany.', u'Amid other accommodations to religious faith after Hitler attacked the Soviet Union, churches were reopened, Radio Moscow began broadcasting a religious hour, and a historic meeting between Stalin and Orthodox Church leader Patriarch Sergius of Moscow was held in 1943.', u'Stalin had the support of the majority of the religious people in the Soviet Union even through the late 1980s.', u'The general tendency of this period was an increase in religious activity among believers of all faiths.', u"The Soviet establishment under General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev's leadership clashed with the churches in 1958\u20131964, a period when atheism was emphasized in the educational curriculum, and numerous state publications promoted atheistic views.", u'During this period, the number of churches fell from 20,000 to 10,000 from 1959 to 1965, and the number of synagogues dropped from 500 to 97.', u'The number of working mosques also declined, falling from 1,500 to 500 within a decade.', u'Religious institutions remained monitored by the Soviet government, but churches, synagogues, temples, and mosques were all given more leeway in the Brezhnev era.', u'Official relations between the Orthodox Church and the Soviet government again warmed to the point that the Brezhnev government twice honored Orthodox Patriarch Alexy I with the Order of the Red Banner of Labour.', u'A poll conducted by Soviet authorities in 1982 recorded 20 percent of the Soviet population as "active religious believers."', u'=== Women ===\n\nSoviet efforts to expand social, political and economic opportunities for women constitute "the earliest and perhaps most far-reaching attempt ever undertaken to transform the status and role of women."', u"== Culture ==\n\nThe culture of the Soviet Union passed through several stages during the USSR's 69-year existence.", u'During the first eleven years following the Revolution (1918\u20131929), there was relative freedom and artists experimented with several different styles to find a distinctive Soviet style of art.', u'Lenin wanted art to be accessible to the Russian people.', u'On the other hand, hundreds of intellectuals, writers, and artists were exiled or executed, and their work banned, for example Nikolay Gumilyov (shot for alleged conspiring against the Bolshevik regime) and Yevgeny Zamyatin (banned).', u'The government encouraged a variety of trends.', u'In art and literature, numerous schools, some traditional and others radically experimental, proliferated.', u'Communist writers Maxim Gorky and Vladimir Mayakovsky were active during this time.', u"Film, as a means of influencing a largely illiterate society, received encouragement from the state; much of director Sergei Eisenstein's best work dates from this period.", u"Later, during Stalin's rule, Soviet culture was characterized by the rise and domination of the government-imposed style of socialist realism, with all other trends being severely repressed, with rare exceptions, for example Mikhail Bulgakov's works.", u'Many writers were imprisoned and killed.', u'Following the Khrushchev Thaw of the late 1950s and early 1960s, censorship was diminished.', u'During this time, a distinctive period of Soviet culture developed characterized by conformist public life and intense focus on personal life.', u'Greater experimentation in art forms were again permissible, with the result that more sophisticated and subtly critical work began to be produced.', u'The regime loosened its emphasis on socialist realism; thus, for instance, many protagonists of the novels of author Yury Trifonov concerned

{'sentences': [u'On boats and ships, keel can refer to either of two parts: a structural element that sometimes resembles a fin and protrudes below a boat along the central line, or a hydrodynamic element.', u'These parts overlap.', u'As the laying down of the keel is the initial step in construction of a ship, in British and American shipbuilding traditions the construction is dated from this event.', u"Only the ship's launching is considered more significant in its creation.", u'The word can also be used as a synecdoche to refer to a complete boat, such as a keelboat.', u'== Structural keels ==\n\nA structural keel is the bottom-most structural member around which the hull of a ship is built.', u'The keel runs along the centerline of the ship, from the bow to the stern.', u"The keel is often the first part of a ship's hull to be constructed, and laying the keel, or placing the keel in the cradle in which the ship will be built may mark the start time of its construction.", u'Large, modern ships are now often built in a series of pre-fabricated, complete hull sections rather than being built around a single keel, so shipbuilding process commences with cutting the first sheet of steel.', u'The most common type of keel is the "flat plate keel", and this is fitted in the majority of ocean-going ships and other vessels.', u'A form of keel found on smaller vessels is the "bar keel", which may be fitted in trawlers, tugs, and smaller ferries.', u'Where grounding is possible, this type of keel is suitable with its massive scantlings, but there is always a problem of the increased draft with no additional cargo capacity.', u'If a double bottom is fitted, the keel is almost inevitably of the flat plate type, bar keels often being associated with open floors, where the plate keel may also be fitted.', u'Duct keels are provided in the bottom of some vessels.', u'These run from the forward engine room bulkhead to the collision bulkhead and are utilized to carry the double bottom piping.', u'The piping is then accessible when cargo is loaded.', u'== Hydrodynamic keels ==\n\n\n=== Non-sailing keels ===\nThe keel surface on the bottom of the hull gives the ship greater directional control and stability.', u'In non-sailing hulls, the keel helps the hull to move forward, rather than slipping to the side.', u'In traditional boat building, this is provided by the structural keel, which projects from the bottom of the hull along most or all of its length.', u'In modern construction the bar keel or flat-plate keel performs the same function.', u'There are many types of fixed keels, including full keels, long keels, fin keels, winged keels, bulb keels, and bilge keels among other designs.', u'Deep draft ships will typically have a flat bottom and employ only bilge keels, both to aid directional control and to damp rolling motions\n\n\n=== Sailboat keels ===\nIn sailboats, keels use the forward motion of the boat to generate lift to counteract the leeward force of the wind.', u'The rudimentary purpose of the keel is to convert the sideways motion of the wind when it is abeam into forward motion.', u'A secondary purpose of the keel is to provide ballast.', u'Keels are different from centreboards and other types of foils in that keels are made of heavy materials to provide ballast to stabilize the boat.', u'Keels may be fixed, or non-movable, or they may retract to allow sailing in shallower waters.', u'Retracting keels may pivot (a swing keel) or slide upwards to retract, and are usually retracted with a winch due to the weight of the ballast.', u'Since the keel provides far more stability when lowered than when retracted (due to the greater moment arm involved), the amount of sail carried is generally reduced when sailing with the keel retracted.', u'Types of non-fixed keels include swing keels and canting keels.', u'Canting keels can be found on racing yachts, such as those competing in the Volvo Ocean Race.', u'They provide considerably more righting moment as the keel moves out to the windward-side of the boat while using less weight.', u'The horizontal distance from the weight to the pivot is increased, which generates a larger righting moment.', u'== Etymology ==\nThe word "keel" comes from Old English c\u0113ol, Old Norse kj\xf3ll, = "ship" or "keel".', u'It has the distinction of being regarded by some scholars as the very first word in the English language recorded in writing, having been recorded by Gildas in his 6th century Latin work De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae, under the spelling cyulae (he was referring to the three ships that the Saxons first arrived in).', u'Carina is the Latin word for "keel" and is the origin of the term careen (to clean a keel and the hull in general, often by rolling the ship on its side).', u'An example of this use is Careening Cove, a suburb of Sydney, Australia, where careening was carried out in early colonial days.', u'== See also ==\nCoin

{'sentences': [u'In baseball, a home run (abbreviated HR, also "homer", "dinger", "dong", "bomb", "blast", "goner" , "shot", or "four-bagger") is scored when the ball is hit in such a way that the batter is able to circle the bases and reach home safely in one play without any errors being committed by the defensive team in the process.', u'In modern baseball, the feat is typically achieved by hitting the ball over the outfield fence between the foul poles (or making contact with either foul pole) without first touching the ground, resulting in an automatic home run.', u'There is also the "inside-the-park" home run, increasingly rare in modern baseball, where the batter reaches home safely while the baseball is in play on the field.', u'When a home run is scored, the batter is also credited with a hit and a run scored, and an RBI for each runner that scores, including himself.', u'Likewise, the pitcher is recorded as having given up a hit, and a run for each runner that scores including the batter.', u'Homeruns are among the most popular aspects of baseball and, as a result, prolific home run hitters are usually the most popular among fans and consequently the highest paid by teams\u2014hence the old saying, variously attributed to slugger Ralph Kiner, or to a teammate talking about Kiner, "Home run hitters drive Cadillacs, and singles hitters drive Fords."', u'== Types of home runs ==\n\n\n=== Out of the park ===\n\nIn modern times a home run is most often scored when the ball is hit over the outfield wall between the foul poles (in fair territory) before it touches the ground (in flight), and without being caught or deflected back onto the field by a fielder.', u'A batted ball is also a home run if it touches either foul pole or its attached screen before touching the ground, as the foul poles are by definition in fair territory.', u'Furthermore, many major-league ballparks have ground rules stating that a batted ball striking specific architectural features while in flight is a home run due to their location beyond the outfield wall.', u'A batted ball that goes over the outfield wall after touching the ground is not a home run, but an automatic double for the batter (often colloqually called a "ground rule double").', u'A fielder is allowed to reach over the wall to attempt to catch the ball as long as his feet are on or over the field during the attempt.', u'If the fielder successfully catches the ball while it is in flight the batter is out, even if the ball has already passed the vertical plane of the wall.', u'However, since the fielder is not part of the field, a ball that bounces off a fielder and over the wall without touching the ground is still a home run.', u"A fielder may not deliberately throw his glove, cap, or any other equipment or apparel to stop or deflect a fair ball, and an umpire may award a home run to the batter if a fielder does so on a ball that, in the umpire's judgment, would have otherwise been a home run (this is rare in modern professional baseball).", u'A home run accomplished in any of the above manners is an automatic home run.', u'The ball is dead, even if it rebounds onto the field from striking a foul pole or an object beyond the outfield wall, and the batter and any preceding runners cannot be put out at any time while running the bases.', u"However, if one or more runners fail to touch a base or one runner passes another before reaching home plate, that runner or runners can be called out on appeal, though in the case of not touching a base a runner can go back and touch it if doing so won't cause them to be passed by another preceding runner and they have not yet touched the next base (or home plate in the case of missing third base).", u'This stipulation is in Approved Ruling (2) of Rule 7.10(b).', u'=== Inside-the-park home run ===\n\nAn inside-the-park home run occurs when a batter hits the ball into play and is able to circle the bases before the fielders can put him out.', u'Unlike with an outside-the-park home run, the batter-runner and all preceding runners are liable to be put out by the defensive team at any time while running the bases.', u'This can only happen if the ball does not leave the ballfield.', u'In the early days of baseball, outfields were relatively much more spacious, reducing the likelihood of an over-the-fence home run, while increasing the likelihood of an inside-the-park home run, as a ball getting past an outfielder had more distance that it could roll before a fielder could track it down.', u"With outfields much less spacious and more uniformly designed than in the game's early days, inside-the-park home runs are now a rarity.", u'They are usually the result of a ball being hit by a very fast runner, coupled with an outfielder either misjudging the flight of the ball (e.g., diving and missing) or the ball taking an unexpected bounce.', u'Either way, this sends the ball into open space in the outfield and thereby allows the batter-runner to circle the bases before the defensive team can put him out.', u'The speed of the runner is crucial as even triples are relatively rare in most modern ballparks.', u'If any defensive play on an inside-the-park home run is labeled an error by the official scorer, a home run is not scored; instead, it is scored as a single, double, or triple, and the batter-runner and any applicable preceding runners are said to have taken all additional bases on error.', u'All runs scored on such a play, however, still count.', u'An example of an unexpected bounce occurred during the 2007 Major League Baseball All-Star Game at AT&T Park in San Francisco on July 10, 2007.', u'Ichiro Suzuki of the American League team hit a fly ball off the right-center field wall, which caromed in the opposite direction from where National League right fielder Ken Griffey, Jr. was expecting it to go.', u'By the time the ball was relayed, Ichiro had already crossed the plate standing up.', u"This was the first inside-the-park home run in All-Star Game history, and led to Suzuki being named the game's Most Valuable Player.", u'== Number of runs batted in ==\nHome runs are often characterized by the number of runners on base at the time.', u'A home run hit with the bases empty is seldom called a "one-run homer", but rather a solo home run, solo homer, or "solo shot".', u'With one runner on base, two runs are scored (the baserunner and the batter) and thus the home run is often called a two-run homer or two-run shot.', u'Similarly, a home runs with two runners on base is a three-run homer or three-run shot.', u'The term "four-run homer" is seldom used; instead, it is nearly always called a "grand slam".', u"Hitting a grand slam is the best possible result for the batter's turn at bat and the worst possible result for the pitcher and his team.", u'=== Grand slam ===\n\nA grand slam occurs when the bases are "loaded" (that is, there are base runners standing at first, second, and third base) and the batter hits a home run.', u'According to The Dickson Baseball Dictionary, the term originated in the card game of contract bridge.', u'An inside-the-park grand slam is a grand slam that is also an inside-the-park home run, a home run without the ball leaving the field, and it is very rare, due to the relative rarity of loading the bases along with the significant rarity (nowadays) of inside-the-park home runs.', u'On July 25, 1956, Roberto Clemente became the only MLB player to have ever scored a walk-off inside-the-park grand slam in a 9\u20138 Pittsburgh Pirates win over the Chicago Cubs, at Forbes Field.', u'On April 23, 1999, Fernando Tat\xeds made history by hitting two grand slams in one inning, both against Chan Ho Park of the Los Angeles Dodgers.', u'With this feat, Tat\xeds also set a Major League record with 8 RBI in one inning.', u'On July 29, 2003 against the Texas Rangers, Bill Mueller of the Boston Red Sox became the only player in major league history to hit two grand slams in one game from opposite sides of the plate.', u'In fact, he hit three home runs in that game, and his two grand slams were in consecutive at-bats.', u"On August 25, 2011 the New York Yankees became the first team to hit three grand slams in one game vs the Oakland A's.", u'The Yankees eventually went on to win the game 22\u20139, after trailing 7\u20131.', u'== Specific situation home runs ==\nThese types of home runs are characterized by the specific game situation in which they occur, and can theoretically occur on either an outside-the-park or inside-the-park home run.', u'=== Walk-off home run ===\n\nA walk-off home run is a home run hit by the home team in the bottom of the ninth inning, any extra inning, or other scheduled final inning, which gives the home team the lead and thereby ends the game.', u'The term is attributed to Hall of Fame relief pitcher Dennis Eckersley, so named because after the run is scored, the losing team has to "walk off" the field.', u'Two World Series have ended via the "walk-off" home run.', u'The first was the 1960 World Series when Bill Mazeroski of the Pittsburgh Pirates hit a 9th inning solo home run in the 7th game of the series off New York Yankees pitcher Ralph Terry to give the Pirates the World Championship.', u'The second time was the 1993 World Series when Joe Carter of the Toronto Blue Jays hit a 9th inning 3-run home run off Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Mitch Williams in Game 6 of the series, to help the Toronto Blue Jays capture their second World Series Championship in a row.', u'Such a home run can also be called a "sudden death" or "sudden victory" home run.', u'That usage has lessened as "walk-off home run" has gained favor.', u'Along with Mazeroski\'s 1960 shot, the most famous walk-off or sudden-death homer would probably be the "Shot Heard \'Round the World" hit by Bobby Thomson to win the 1951 National League pennant for the New York Giants.', u"A walk-off home run over the fence is an exception to baseball's one-run rule.", u'Normally if the home team is tied or behind in the ninth or extra innings the game ends as soon as the home team scores enough runs to achieve a lead.', u'If the home team has two outs in the inning, and the game is tied, the game will officially end either the moment the batter successfully reaches 1st base or the moment the runner touches home plate\u2014whichever happens last.', u'However, this is superseded by the "ground rule", which provides automatic doubles (when a ball-in-play hits the ground first then leaves the playing field) and home runs (when a ball-in-play leaves the playing field without ever touching the ground).', u'In the latter case, all base runners including the batter are allowed to cross the plate.', u'=== Lead-off home run ===\nA lead-off home run is a home run hit by the first batter of a team, the leadoff hitter of the first inning of the game.', u'In MLB, Rickey Henderson holds the record with 81 lead-off home runs.', u'Craig Biggio holds the National League record with 53, second overall to Henderson.', u'In 1996, Brady Anderson set a Major League record by hitting a lead-off home run in four consecutive games.', u'=== Back-to-back ===\nWhen two consecutive batters each hit a home run, this is described as back-to-back home runs.', u'It is still considered back-to-back even if both batters hit their home runs off different pitchers.', u'A third batter hitting a home run is commonly referred to as back-to-back-to-back, the most recent occurrence on opening day, April 4, 2016 when Denard Span, Joe Panik and Buster Posey of the San Francisco Giants hit back-to-back-to-back home runs off Ariel Pena of the Milwaukee Brewers.', u'Four home runs in a row by consecutive batters has only occurred eight times in the history of Major League Baseball.', u'Following convention, this is called back-to-back-to-back-to-back.', u'The most recent occurrence was on August 11, 2010, when the Arizona Diamondbacks hit four in a row against the Milwaukee Brewers in Miller Park as Adam LaRoche, Miguel Montero, Mark Reynolds and Stephen Drew homered off pitcher Dave Bush.', u'Bush became the third pitcher to surrender back-to-back-to-back-to-back home runs, following Paul Foytack on July 31, 1963 and Chase Wright on April 22, 2007.', u'On August 14, 2008, the Chicago White Sox defeated the Kansas City Royals 9-2.', u'In this game, Jim Thome, Paul Konerko, Alexei Ram\xedrez, and Juan Uribe hit back-to-back-to-back-to-back home runs in that order.', u'Thome, Konerko, and Ramirez blasted their homers off of Joel Peralta, while Uribe did it off of Rob Tejeda.', u'The next batter, veteran backstop Toby Hall, tried aimlessly to hit the ball as far as possible, but his effort resulted in a strike out.', u'On April 22, 2007 the Boston Red Sox were trailing the New York Yankees 3\u20130 when Manny Ramirez, J. D. Drew, Mike Lowell and Jason Varitek hit back-to-back-to-back-to-back home runs to put them up 4\u20133.', u'They eventually went on to win the game 7\u20136 after a three-run home run by Mike Lowell in the bottom of the 7th inning.', u'On September 18, 2006 trailing 9\u20135 to the San Diego Padres in the 9th inning, Jeff Kent, J. D. Drew, Russell Martin, and Marlon Anderson of the Los Angeles Dodgers hit back-to-back-to-back-to-back home runs to tie the game.', u'After giving up a run in the top of the 10th, the Dodgers won the game in the bottom of the 10th, on a walk-off two run home run by Nomar Garciaparra.', u'J. D. Drew has been part of two different sets of back-to-back-to-back-to-back home runs.', u'In both occurrences, his homer was the second of the four.', u"On September 30, 1997, in the sixth inning of Game One of the American League Division Series between the New York Yankees and Cleveland Indians, Tim Raines, Derek Jeter and Paul O'Neill hit back-to-back-to-back home runs for the Yankees.", u"Raines' home run tied the game.", u'New York went on to win 8\u20136.', u'This was the first occurrence of three home runs in a row ever in postseason play.', u'The Boston Red Sox repeated the feat in Game Four of the 2007 American League Championship Series, also against the Indians.', u'Twice in MLB history have two brothers hit back-to-back home runs.', u'On April 23, 2013, brothers Melvin Upton, Jr. (formerly B.J.', u'Upton) and Justin Upton hit back-to-back home runs.', u'The first time was on September 15, 1938, when Lloyd Waner and Paul Waner performed the feat.', u'Simple back-to-back home runs are a relatively frequent occurrence.', u'If a pitcher gives up a homer, he might have his concentration broken and might alter his normal approach in an attempt to "make up for it" by striking out the next batter with some fastballs.', u'Sometimes the next batter will be expecting that and will capitalize on it.', u'A notable back-to-back home run of that type in World Series play involved "Babe Ruth\'s called shot" in 1932, which was accompanied by various Ruthian theatrics, yet the pitcher, Charlie Root, was allowed to stay in the game.', u'He delivered just one more pitch, which Lou Gehrig drilled out of the park for a back-to-back shot, after which Root was removed from the game.', u'In Game 3 of the 1976 NLCS, George Foster and Johnny Bench hit back-to-back homers in the last of the ninth off Ron Reed to tie the game.', u'The Series-winning run was scored later in the inning.', u'Another notable pair of back-to-back home runs occurred on September 14, 1990, when Ken Griffey, Sr. and Ken Griffey, Jr. hit back-to-back home runs, off Kirk McCaskill, the only father-and-son duo to do so in Major League history.', u'On May 2, 2002, Bret Boone and Mike Cameron of the Seattle Mariners hit back-to-back home runs off of starter Jon Rauch in the first inning of a game against the Chicago White Sox.', u'The Mariners batted around in the inning, and Boone and Cameron came up to bat against reliever Jim Parque with two outs, again hitting back-to-back home runs and becoming the only pair of teammates to hit back-to-back home runs twice in the same inning.', u'On June 19, 2012, Jos\xe9 Bautista and Colby Rasmus hit back-to-back home runs and back-to-back-to-back home runs with Edwin Encarnaci\xf3n for a lead change in each instance.', u'=== Consecutive home runs by one batter ===\nThe occurrence of individuals hitting home runs in consecutive at-bats is not unusual, but three or more is rare.', u'If a player hits three home runs in a game, it is termed a hat-trick (which is also used for a player getting three strikeouts in a game).', u'The record for consecutive home runs by a batter under any circumstances is 4.', u'Of the sixteen players (through 2012) who have hit 4 in one game, six have hit them consecutively.', u'Twenty-eight other batters have hit four consecutive across two games.', u'Bases on balls do not count as at-bats, and Ted Williams holds the record for consecutive home runs across the most games, 4 in four games played, during September 17\u201322, 1957, for the Red Sox.', u'Williams hit a pinch-hit homer on the 17th; walked as a pinch-hitter on the 18th; there was no game on the 19th; hit another pinch-homer on the 20th; homered and then was lifted for a pinch-runner after at least one walk, on the 21st; and homered after at least one walk on the 22nd.', u'All in all, he had 4 walks interspersed among his 4 homers.', u'In World Series play, Reggie Jackson hit a record three in one Series game, the final game (Game 6) in 1977.', u'But those three were a part of a much more impressive feat.', u'He walked on four pitches in the second inning of game 6.', u'Then he hit his three home runs on the first pitch of his next three at bats, off of three different pitchers (4th inning- Hooten, 5th inning- Sosa, 8th inning- Hough).', u'He had also hit one in his last at bat of the previous game, giving him four home runs on four consecutive swings.', u'(His home run in game 5 was also hit on the first pitch, although this did not add to any significant streak.)', u'The four in a row set the record for consecutive homers across two Series games.', u'In Game 3 of the World Series in 2011, Albert Pujols hit three home runs to tie the record with Babe Ruth and Reggie Jackson.', u'The St. Louis Cardinals went on to win the World Series in Game 7 at Busch Stadium.', u'In Game 1 of the World Series in 2012, Pablo Sandoval of the San Francisco Giants hit three home runs on his first three at-bats of the Series, also tying the record with Pujols, Jackson, and Ruth.', u'Nomar Garciaparra holds the record for consecutive home runs in the shortest time in terms of innings: 3 homers in 2 innings, on July 23, 2002, for the Boston Red Sox.', u'=== Home run cycle ===\n\nAn offshoot of hitting for the cycle, a "home run cycle" is where a player hits a solo, 2-run, 3-run, and grand slam home run all in one game.', u'This is an extremely rare feat, as it requires the batter to not only hit four home runs in a game (which itself has only occurred 16 times in the Major Leagues), but also to hit those home runs with the specific number of runners already on base.', u"Although it is a rare accomplishment, it is largely dependent on circumstances outside the player's control, such as his preceding teammates' ability to get on base, as well as the order in which he comes to bat in any particular inning.", u'Another variant of the home run cycle would be the "natural home run cycle", which would require a batter to hit a solo, 2-run, 3-run, and grand slam home run in that order.', u'Though multiple home run cycles have been recorded in collegiate baseball, the only home run cycle in a professional baseball game belongs to Tyrone Horne, who stroked four long balls for the minor league, Double-A Arkansas Travelers in a game against the San Antonio Missions on July 27, 1998.', u'On May 20, 1998, the Triple-A Indianapolis Indians performed a feat possibly never before duplicated in professional baseball.', u'In the fifth inning of a game against the Pawtucket Red Sox, Indianapolis players hit for a "Homer Cycle".', u'Pete Rose, Jr. opened the inning with a solo home run, Jason Williams connected for a 3-run shot, Glenn Murray slugged a grand slam, and Guillermo Garcia finished the scoring with a 2-run blast.', u'The Indians won the game 11\u20134.', u'A major league player has come close to hitting for the home run cycle several times.', u'Recent examples include:\nApril 2, 1997, Tino Martinez of the New York Yankees, was a grand slam away from accomplishing this feat against his former team, the Seattle Mariners.', u'He hit a 3-run home run in the first inning, a 2-run home run in the third inning and a solo shot in the fifth inning; all off starting pitcher Scott Sanders.', u'April 26, 2005 Alex Rodriguez of the New York Yankees hit 3 home runs off Los Angeles Angels pitcher Bartolo Col\xf3n.', u'Rodriguez hit a 3-run home run, 2-run home run, and a grand slam in the first, third, and fourth innings, respectively.', u'May 16, 2008 Jayson Werth of the Philadelphia Phillies hit 3 home runs off Toronto Blue Jays pitchers David Purcey and Jesse Litsch.', u'Werth hit a 3-run home run, a grand slam, and a solo home run in the second, third, and fifth innings, respectively.', u'June 26, 2009, Andre Ethier of Los Angeles Dodgers hit a three-run home run off Jason Vargas in the second, a two-run home run off Roy Corcoran in the sixth, and a solo home run off Miguel Batista in the eighth inning in a game against Seattle Mariners.', u'July 7, 2009, Paul Konerko of the Chicago White Sox hit a solo home run in the second inning off Cleveland Indians pitcher Jeremy Sowers, a grand slam in the sixth inning off reliever Chris Perez, and a two-run home run in the seventh inning off reliever Winston

2015, Jarrett Parker of the San Francisco Giants hit three home runs against the Oakland Athletics: a solo home run in the second inning, a 2-run home run in the seventh inning, and a grand slam in the eighth inning.', u'== History of the home run ==\nIn the early days of the game, when the ball was less lively and the ballparks generally had very large outfields, most home runs were of the inside-the-park variety.', u'The first home run ever hit in the National League was by Ross Barnes of the Chicago White Stockings (now known as the Chicago Cubs), in 1876.', u'The home "run" was literally descriptive.', u'Home runs over the fence were rare, and only in ballparks where a fence was fairly close.', u'Hitters were discouraged from trying to hit home runs, with the conventional wisdom being that if they tried to do so they would simply fly out.', u"This was a serious concern in the 19th century, because in baseball's early days a ball caught after one bounce was still an out.", u'The emphasis was on place-hitting and what is now called "manufacturing runs" or "small ball".', u"The home run's place in baseball changed dramatically when the live-ball era began after World War I.", u'First, the materials and manufacturing processes improved significantly, making the now-mass-produced, cork-centered ball somewhat more lively.', u'Batters such as Babe Ruth and Rogers Hornsby took full advantage of rules changes that were instituted during the 1920s, particularly prohibition of the spitball, and the requirement that balls be replaced when worn or dirty.', u'These changes resulted in the baseball being easier to see and hit, and easier to hit out of the park.', u"Meanwhile, as the game's popularity boomed, more outfield seating was built, shrinking the size of the outfield and increasing the chances of a long fly ball resulting in a home run.", u'The teams with the sluggers, typified by the New York Yankees, became the championship teams, and other teams had to change their focus from the "inside game" to the "power game" in order to keep up.', u'Before 1931, a ball that bounced over an outfield fence during a major league game was considered a home run.', u'The rule was changed to require the ball to clear the fence on the fly, and balls that reached the seats on a bounce became ground rule doubles in most parks.', u'A carryover of the old rule is that if a player deflects a ball over the outfield fence without it touching the ground, it is a home run.', u'Also, until approximately that time, the ball had to not only go over the fence in fair territory, but to land in the bleachers in fair territory or to still be visibly fair when disappearing behind a wall.', u'The rule stipulated "fair when last seen" by the umpires.', u'Photos from that era in ballparks, such as the Polo Grounds and Yankee Stadium, show ropes strung from the foul poles to the back of the bleachers, or a second "foul pole" at the back of the bleachers, in a straight line with the foul line, as a visual aid for the umpire.', u'Ballparks still use a visual aid much like the ropes; a net or screen attached to the foul poles on the fair side has replaced ropes.', u'As with American football, where a touchdown once required a literal "touch down" of the ball in the end zone but now only requires the "breaking of the [vertical] plane" of the goal line, in baseball the ball need only "break the plane" of the fence in fair territory (unless the ball is caught by a player who is in play, in which case the batter is called out).', u"Babe Ruth's 60th home run in 1927 was somewhat controversial, because it landed barely in fair territory in the stands down the right field line.", u'Ruth lost a number of home runs in his career due to the when-last-seen rule.', u'Bill Jenkinson, in The Year Babe Ruth Hit 104 Home Runs, estimates that Ruth lost at least 50 and as many as 78 in his career due to this rule.', u'Further, the rules once stipulated that an over-the-fence home run in a sudden-victory situation would only count for as many bases as was necessary to "force" the winning run home.', u'For example, if a team trailed by two runs with the bases loaded, and the batter hit a fair ball over the fence, it only counted as a triple, because the runner immediately ahead of him had technically already scored the game-winning run.', u'That rule was changed in the 1920s as home runs became increasingly frequent and popular.', u"Babe Ruth's career total of 714 would have been one higher had that rule not been in effect in the early part of his career.", u'Major League Baseball keeps running totals of all-time home runs by team, including teams no longer active (prior to 1900) as well as by individual players.', u'Gary Sheffield hit the 250,000th home run in MLB history with a grand slam on September 8, 2008.', u"Sheffield had hit MLB's 249,999th home run against Gio Gonzalez in his previous at-bat.", u'The all-time, verified professional baseball record for career home runs for one player, excluding the U. S.

League, then the only major league in baseball.', u'Johnson changed the name of the league to the American League, leading teams in his league to be christened with the unofficial nickname "Americans".', u'This was especially true in the case of the new Boston franchise, which would not adopt an official nickname until 1908.', u'The upstart league placed franchises in Baltimore, Maryland and Buffalo.', u"After looking at his new league, Ban Johnson decided that he would need a team in Boston to compete with the National League team there, and so cancelled the Buffalo club's franchise, offering one to a new club in Boston.", u'The Boston franchise was purchased in 1903 by Milwaukee publisher, George Brumder who sold the team one year later.', u'Playing their home games at Huntington Avenue Grounds, the Boston franchise finished second and third before capturing their first pennant in 1903 and repeating the next year.', u"Those teams were led by manager and star third

u'The Pirates were heavily favored as they had won the NL pennant by 6\xbd games.', u'Aided by the modified chants of "Tessie" by the Royal Rooters fan club and by its stronger pitching staff, the Americans managed to overcome the odds, and win the best-of-nine series five games to three.', u'The 1904 club was almost as good as the previous team, but due to the surprise emergence of the New York Highlanders, the Boston club found itself in a tight pennant race through the last games of the season.', u'A predecessor to what would become a storied rivalry, this race featured such controversial moves as the trade of Patsy Dougherty to the Highlanders for Bob Unglaub.', u"The climax of the season occurred on the last, dramatic doubleheader at the Highlanders' home stadium,

third in the top of the ninth, a spitball got away from Chesbro and Lou Criger scored the go-ahead run on one of the most famous wild pitches in history.", u'Unfortunately, the NL champion New York Giants declined to play any postseason series, fearing it would give their New York rivals credibility (they had expected the Highlanders to win), but a sharp public reaction led the two leagues immediately to make the World Series a permanent championship, starting in 1905.', u'These successful times soon ended, however, as Boston lost 100 games in 1906.', u'However, several new star players helped the newly renamed Red Sox improve almost immediately.', u'By 1909, legendary center fielder Tris Speaker had become a fixture in the Boston outfield, and the team worked their way to third place.', u'However, the Red Sox would not win the pennant again until their 105-win 1912 season, finishing with a club record .691 winning percentage.', u"Anchored by an outfield considered to be

in 1915 propelled the Red Sox to the 1915 World Series, where they beat the Philadelphia Phillies four games to one.', u'Following the 1915 season, Tris Speaker was traded to the Cleveland Indians.', u'His departure was more than compensated for, however, by the emergence of star pitcher Babe Ruth.', u'The Red Sox went on to win the 1916 World Series, this time defeating the Brooklyn Robins.', u'In 1918, Babe Ruth led his team to another World Series championship, this time over the Chicago Cubs.', u'=== Sale of Babe Ruth and Aftermath (1920\u201338) ===\n\nHarry Frazee bought the Red Sox from Joseph Lannin in 1916 for about $500,000.', u'A couple of notable trades involving Harry Frazee and the Yankees occurred before the Babe Ruth sale.', u'On December 18, 1918, outstanding outfielder Duffy Lewis, pitcher Dutch Leonard (who had posted a modern record 0.96 ERA in 1914), and pitcher Ernie Shore were traded to the Yankees for pitcher Ray Caldwell, Slim Love, Roxy Walters, Frank Gilhooley and $15,000.', u'As all three players were well regarded in Boston\u2014Lewis had been a key player on the 1910s championship teams, Shore had famously relieved Babe Ruth and retired 27 straight, and Leonard had only four years before setting a modern record for earned run average\u2014this trade was regarded as a poor one in Boston.', u'Then, on July 13, 1919, submarine-style pitching star Carl Mays was traded to the Yankees for Bob McGraw, Allan Russell and $40,000.', u'Mays would go on to have several good years for the Yankees, but had been a discipline problem for the Red Sox.', u'On December 26, 1919, Frazee sold Babe Ruth, who had played the previous six seasons for the Red Sox, to the rival New York Yankees (Ruth had just broken the single-season home run record, hitting 29 in 1919.)', u'Legend has it that Frazee did so in order to finance the Broadway play No, No, Nanette.', u'That play did not actually open on Broadway until 1925, but as Leigh Montville discovered during research for his book, The Big Bam: The Life and Times of Babe Ruth, No, No, Nanette had originated as a non-musical stage play called My Lady Friends, which opened on Broadway in December 1919.', u'My Lady Friends had, indeed, been financed by the Ruth sale to the Yankees.', u'During that period, the Red Sox, Yankees and Chicago White Sox had a d\xe9tente; they were called "Insurrectos" because their actions antagonized league president Ban Johnson.', u'Although Frazee owned the Boston Red Sox franchise, he did not own Fenway Park (it was owned by the Fenway Park Trust), making his ownership a precarious one; Johnson could move another team into the ballpark.', u'His club was in debt, but Frazee felt the need to purchase its playing site (which he did in 1920).', u'Further, providing the Yankees with a box office attraction would help that mediocre club, which had sided with him against Johnson and "the Loyal Five" clubs.', u'Finally, Ruth was considered a serious disciplinary problem, a reputation he amply confirmed while playing for the Yankees.', u'Frazee moved Ruth to stabilize Red Sox finances and cut distractions.', u'It was a straight sale, no players in return.', u'New York achieved great success after acquiring Ruth and several other very good players.', u'The sale of Babe Ruth came to be viewed as the beginning of the Yankees\u2013Red Sox rivalry, considered the "Greatest Rivalry on Earth" by American sports journalists.', u'After deciding to get out of baseball, Frazee began selling many of his star players.', u'In the winter of 1920, Wally Schang, Waite Hoyt, Harry Harper and Mike McNally were traded to the Yankees for Del Pratt, Muddy Ruel, John Costello, Hank Thormahlen, Sammy Vick and cash.', u'The following winter, iron man shortstop Everett Scott, and pitchers Bullet Joe Bush and Sad Sam Jones were traded to the Yankees for Roger Peckinpaugh (who would be immediately shipped to the Washington Senators), Jack Quinn, Rip Collins, Bill Piercy and $50,000.', u"On July 23, 1922, Joe Dugan and Elmer Smith were traded to the Yankees for Elmer Miller, Chick Fewster, Johnny Mitchell, and Lefty O'Doul, who was at the time a mediocre pitching prospect.", u'Acquiring Dugan helped the Yankees edge the St. Louis Browns in a tight pennant race, and the resulting uproar helped create a June 15 trading deadline that went into effect the next year.', u'Perhaps an even more outrageous deal was the trade of Herb Pennock, occurring in early 1923.', u'Pennock was traded by the Red Sox to the Yankees for Camp Skinner, Norm McMillan, George Murray and $50,000.', u'The loss of so much talent sent the Red Sox into free fall, even with the money Frazee earned from the trades.', u'During the 1920s and early 1930s, they were fixtures in the second division, never finishing closer than 20 games out of first.', u'The losses only mounted when Frazee sold the team to Bob Quinn in 1923.', u'During an eight-year period from 1925 to 1932, the Red Sox averaged over 100 losses per season, bottoming out in 1932 with a record of 43-111, still the worst record in franchise history.', u'One of the few bright spots on these teams was Earl Webb, who set the all-time mark for most doubles in a season in 1931 with 67.', u"The BoSox' fortunes began to change in 1933 when Tom Yawkey bought the team.", u'Yawkey acquired pitcher Wes Ferrell and one of the greatest pitchers of all-time, Lefty Grove, making his team competitive once again in the late thirties.', u'He also acquired Joe Cronin, an outstanding shortstop and manager and slugging first baseman Jimmie Foxx whose 50 home runs in 1938 would stand as a club record for 68 years.', u'Foxx also drove in a club record 175 runs.', u'=== 1939\u20131960: Williams Era ===\nIn 1939, the Red Sox purchased the contract of outfielder Ted Williams from the minor league San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League, ushering in an era of the team sometimes called the "Ted Sox."', u'Williams consistently hit for both high power and high average, and is generally considered one of the greatest hitters of all time.', u'The right-field bullpens in Fenway were built in part for Williams\' left-handed swing, and are sometimes called "Williamsburg."', u'Before this addition, it was over 400 feet (120 m) to right field.', u'He served two stints in the United States Marine Corps as a pilot and saw active duty in both World War II and the Korean War, missing at least five full seasons of baseball.', u'His book The Science of Hitting is widely read by students of baseball.', u'He is currently the last player to hit over .400 for a full season, batting .406 in 1941.', u'Williams feuded with sports writers his whole career, calling them "The Knights of the Keyboard", and his relationship with the fans was often rocky as he was seen spitting towards the stands on more than one occasion.', u'With Williams, the Red Sox reached the 1946 World Series, but lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games in part because of the use of the "Williams Shift", a defensive tactic in which the shortstop would move to the right side of the infield to make it harder for the left-handed-hitting Williams to hit to that side of the field.', u'Some have claimed that he was too proud to hit to the other side of the field, not wanting to let the Cardinals take away his game.', u'His performance may have also been affected by a pitch he took in the elbow in an exhibition game a few days earlier.', u'Either way, in his only World Series, Williams gathered just five singles in 25 at-bats for a .200 average.', u'The Cardinals won the 1946 Series when Enos Slaughter scored the go-ahead run all the way from first base on a base hit to left field.', u'The throw from Leon Culberson was cut off by shortstop Johnny Pesky, who relayed the ball to the plate just a hair too late.', u'Some say Pesky hesitated or "held the ball" before he turned to throw the ball, but this has been disputed.', u'Along with Williams and Pesky, the Red Sox featured several other star players during the 1940s, including second baseman Bobby Doerr and center fielder Dom DiMaggio (the younger brother of Joe DiMaggio).', u'The Red Sox narrowly lost the AL pennant in 1948 and 1949.', u'In 1948, Boston finished in a tie with Cleveland, and their loss to Cleveland in a one-game playoff ended hopes of an all-Boston World Series.', u'Curiously, manager Joseph McCarthy chose journeyman Denny Galehouse to start the playoff game when the young lefty phenom Mel Parnell was available to pitch.', u'In 1949, the Red Sox were one game ahead of the New York Yankees, with the only two games left for both teams being against each other, and they lost both of those games.', u'The 1950s were viewed as a time of tribulation for the Red Sox.', u'After Williams returned from the Korean War in 1953, many of the best players from the late 1940s had retired or been traded.', u'The stark contrast in the team led critics to call the Red Sox\' daily lineup "Ted Williams and the Seven Dwarfs."', u'Jackie Robinson was even worked out by the team at Fenway Park, however it appeared that owner Tom Yawkey did not want an African American player on his team at that time.', u'Willie Mays also tried out for Boston and was highly praised by team scouts.', u'In 1955, Frank Malzone debuted at third base and Ted Williams hit .388 at the age of 38 in 1957, but there was little else for Boston fans to root for.', u'Williams retired at the end of the 1960 season, famously hitting a home run in his final at-bat as memorialized in the John Updike story "Hub fans bid Kid adieu."', u'The Red Sox finally became the last Major League team to field an African American player when they promoted infielder Pumpsie Green from their AAA farm team in 1959.', u'=== 1960s ===\n\nThe 1960s also started poorly for the Red Sox, though 1961 saw the debut of Carl "Yaz" Yastrzemski, Williams\' replacement in left field, who developed into one of the better hitters of a pitching-rich decade.', u'Red Sox fans know 1967 as the season of the "Impossible Dream."', u'The slogan refers to the hit song from the popular musical play "Man of La Mancha".', u'1967 saw one of the great pennant races in baseball history with four teams in the AL pennant race until almost the last game.', u'The BoSox had finished the 1966 season in ninth place, but they found new life with Yastrzemski as the team went to the 1967 World Series, only to lose the Series to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games.', u'Yastrzemski won the American League Triple Crown (the most recent player to accomplish such a feat until Miguel Cabrera did so in 2012), hitting .326 with 44 home runs and 121 RBIs.', u'He finished one vote short of a unanimous MVP selection, as a Minnesota sportswriter placed Twins center fielder C\xe9sar Tovar first on his ballot.', u'But the Red Sox lost the series\u2014again to the St. Louis Cardinals, in seven games.', u'Legendary pitcher Bob Gibson stymied the Red Sox winning three games.', u'An 18-year-old Bostonian rookie named Tony Conigliaro slugged 24 home runs in 1964.', u'"Tony C" became the youngest player in Major League Baseball to hit his 100th home run, a record that stands today.', u'He was struck just above the left cheek bone by a fastball thrown by Jack Hamilton of the California Angels on Friday, August 18, 1967 and sat out the entire next season with headaches and blurred vision.', u'Although he did have a productive season in 1970, he was never the same.', u'=== 1970s ===\n\nAlthough the Red Sox were competitive for much of the late 1960s and early 1970s, they never finished higher than second place in their division.', u'The closest they came to a divisional title was 1972, when they lost by a half-game to the Detroit Tigers.', u"The start of the season was delayed by a players' strike, and the Red Sox had lost one more game to the strike than the Tigers had.", u'Games lost to the strike were not made up.', u'The Red Sox went to Detroit with a half-game lead for the final series of the season, but lost the first two of those three and were eliminated from the pennant race.', u'==== 1975 ====\nThe Red Sox won the AL pennant in 1975.', u'The 1975 Red Sox were as colorful as they were talented, with Yastrzemski and rookie outfielders Jim Rice and Fred Lynn, veteran outfielder Dwight Evans, catcher Carlton Fisk, and pitchers Luis Tiant and eccentric junkballer Bill "The Spaceman" Lee.', u'Fred Lynn won both the American League Rookie of the Year award and the Most Valuable Player award, a feat which had never previously been accomplished, and was not duplicated until Ichiro Suzuki did it in 2001.', u"In the 1975 American League Championship Series, the Red Sox swept the Oakland A's.", u'In the 1975 World Series, they faced the heavily favored Cincinnati Reds, also known as The Big Red Machine.', u'Luis Tiant won games 1 and 4 of the World Series but after five games, the Red Sox trailed the series 3 games to 2.', u'Game 6 at Fenway Park is considered among the greatest games in postseason history.', u'Down 6\u20133 in the bottom of the eighth inning, Red Sox pinch hitter Bernie Carbo hit a three-run homer into the center field bleachers off Reds fireman Rawly Eastwick to tie the game.', u'In the top of the eleventh inning, right fielder Dwight Evans made a spectacular catch of a Joe Morgan line drive and doubled Ken Griffey at first base to preserve the tie.', u'In the bottom of the twelfth inning, Carlton Fisk hit a deep fly ball which sliced towards the left field foul pole above the Green Monster.', u'As the ball sailed into the night, Fisk waved his arms frantically towards fair territory, seemingly pleading with the ball not to go foul.', u'The ball complied, and bedlam ensued at Fenway as Fisk rounded the bases to win the game for the Red Sox 7\u20136.', u'The Red Sox lost game 7, 4\u20133 even though they had an early 3\u20130 lead.', u'Starting pitcher Bill Lee threw a slow looping curve which he called a "Leephus pitch" or "space ball" to Reds first baseman Tony P\xe9rez who hit the ball over the Green Monster and across the street.', u'The Reds scored the winning run in the 9th inning.', u'Carlton Fisk said famously about the 1975 World Series, "We won that thing 3 games to 4."', u'==== 1978 pennant race ====\nIn 1978, the Red Sox and the Yankees were involved in a tight pennant race.', u'The Yankees were \u200a14 1\u20442 games behind the Red Sox in July, and on September 10, after completing a 4-game sweep of the Red Sox (known as "The Boston Massacre"), the Yankees tied for the divisional lead.', u"On September 16 the Yankees held a \u200a3 1\u20442 game lead over the Red Sox, but the Sox won 11 of their next 13 games and by the final day of the season, the Yankees' magic number to win the division was one\u2014with a win over Cleveland or a Boston loss to the Toronto Blue Jays clinching the division.", u'However, New York lost 9\u20132 and Boston won 5\u20130, forcing a one-game playoff to be held at Fenway Park on Monday, October 2.', u"The most remembered moment from the game was Bucky Dent's 7th inning three-run home run in off Mike Torrez just over the Green Monster, giving the Yankees their first lead.", u'The dejected Boston manager, Don Zimmer, gave Mr. Dent a new middle name which lives on in Boston sports lore to this day, uttering three words as the ball sailed over the left-field wall: "Bucky F**king Dent!"', u"Reggie Jackson provided a solo home run in the 8th that proved to be the difference in the Yankees' 5\u20134 win, which ended with Yastrzemski popping out to Graig Nettles in foul territory with Rick Burleson representing the tying run at third.", u'Although Dent became a Red Sox demon, the Red Sox would get retribution in 1990 when the Yankees fired Dent as their manager during a series at Fenway Park.', u'=== 1980s ===\n\nCarl Yastrzemski retired after the 1983 season, during which the Red Sox finished sixth in the seven-team AL East, posting their worst record since 1966.', u"==== 1986 ====\n\nHowever, in 1986, it appeared that the team's fortunes were about to change.", u'The offense had remained strong with Jim Rice, Dwight Evans, Don Baylor and Wade Boggs.', u'Roger Clemens led the pitching staff, going 24\u20134 with a 2.48 ERA, and had a 20-strikeout game to win both the American League Cy Young and Most Valuable Player awards.', u'Clemens became the first starting pitcher to win both awards since Vida Blue in 1971.', u'Despite spending a month and a half on the disabled list in the middle of the season, left-hander Bruce Hurst went 13-8, striking out 167 and pitching four shutout games.', u'Boston sportswriters that season compared Clemens and Hurst to Don Drysdale and Sandy Koufax from the 1960s Los Angeles Dodgers.', u'The Red Sox won the AL East for the first time in 11 seasons, and faced the California Angels in the ALCS.', u'The teams split the first two games in Boston, but the Angels won the next two home games, taking a 3\u20131 lead in the series.', u'With the Angels poised to win the series, the Red Sox trailed 5\u20132 heading into the ninth inning of Game 5.', u'A two-run homer by Baylor cut the lead to one.', u'With two outs and a runner on, and one strike away from elimination, Dave Henderson homered off Donnie Moore to put Boston up 6\u20135.', u'Although the Angels tied the game in the bottom of the ninth, the Red Sox won in the 11th on a Henderson sacrifice fly off Moore.', u'The Red Sox then found themselves with six- and seven-run wins at Fenway Park in Games 6 and 7 to win the American League title.', u'The Red Sox faced a heavily favored New York Mets team that had won 108 games in the regular season in the 1986 World Series.', u'Boston won the first two games in Shea Stadium but lost the next two at Fenway, knotting the series at 2 games apiece.', u'After Bruce Hurst recorded his second victory of the series in Game 5, the Red Sox returned to Shea Stadium looking to garner their first championship in 68 years.', u'However, Game 6 would go down as one of the most devastating losses in club history.', u'After pitching seven strong innings, Clemens was lifted from the game with a 3\u20132 lead.', u'Years later, Manager John McNamara said Clemens was suffering from a blister and asked to be taken out of the game, a claim Clemens denied.', u'The Mets then scored a run off reliever and former Met Calvin Schiraldi to tie the score 3\u20133.', u'The game went to extra innings, where the Red Sox took a 5\u20133 lead in the top of the 10th on a solo home run by Henderson, a double by Boggs and an RBI single by second baseman Marty Barrett.', u'After recording two outs in the bottom of the 10th, a graphic appeared on the NBC telecast hailing Barrett as the Player of the Game and Bruce Hurst as World Series MVP.', u'A message even appeared briefly on the Shea Stadium scoreboard congratulating the Red Sox as world champions.', u'After so many years of abject frustration, Red Sox fans around the world could taste victory.', u'With the count at two balls and one strike, Mets catcher Gary Carter hit a single.', u'It was followed by singles by Kevin Mitchell and Ray Knight.', u'With Mookie Wilson batting, a wild pitch by Bob Stanley tied the game at 5.', u"Wilson then hit a slow ground ball to first; the ball rolled through Bill Buckner's legs, allowing Knight to score the winning run from second.", u'While Buckner was singled out as responsible for the loss, many observers\u2014as well as both Wilson and Buckner\u2014have noted that even if Buckner had fielded the ball cleanly, the speedy Wilson probably would still have been safe, leaving the game-winning run at third with two out.', u'Many observers questioned why Buckner was in the game at that point considering he had bad knees and that Dave Stapleton had come in as a late-inning defensive replacement in prior series games.', u'It appeared as though McNamara was trying to reward Buckner for his long and illustrious career by leaving him in the game.', u'After falling behind 3\u20130, the Mets then won Game 7, concluding the devastating collapse and feeding the myth that the Red Sox were "cursed."', u'This World Series loss had a strange twist: Red Sox General Manager Lou Gorman was vice-president, player personnel, of the Mets from 1980 to 1983.', u"Working under Mets' GM Frank Cashen, with whom Gorman served with the Orioles, he helped lay the foundation for the Mets' championship.", u'=== 1988\u20131991 ===\nThe Red Sox returned to the postseason in 1988.', u'With the club in fourth place midway through the 1988 season at the All-Star break, manager John McNamara was fired and replaced by Walpole, Massachusetts, resident and longtime minor-league manager Joe Morgan on July 15.', u'Immediately the club won 12 games in a row, and 19 of 20 overall, to surge to the AL East title in what would be referred to as Morgan Magic.', u'But the magic was short-lived, as the team was swept by the Oakland Athletics in the ALCS.', u'Ironically, the MVP of that Series was former Red Sox pitcher and Baseball Hall of Fame player Dennis Eckersley, who saved all four wins for Oakland.', u'Two years later, in 1990, the Red Sox would again win the division and face the Athletics in the ALCS.', u"However, the outcome was the same, with the A's sweeping the ALCS in four straight.", u'In 1990, Yankees fans started to chant "1918!"', u'to taunt the Red Sox.', u'The demeaning chant would echo at Yankee Stadium each time the Red Sox were there.', u"Also, Fenway Park became the scene of Bucky Dent's worst moment as a manager, although it was where he had his greatest triumph.", u'In June, when the Red Sox swept the Yankees during a four-game series at Fenway Park, the Yankees fired Dent as their manager.', u'Red Sox fans felt retribution to Dent being fired on their field, but the Yankees used him as a scapegoat.', u'However, Dan Shaughnessy of The Boston Globe severely criticized Yankees Owner George Steinbrenner for firing Dent\u2014his 18th managerial change in as many years since becoming owner\u2014in Boston and said he should "have waited until the Yankees got to Baltimore" to fire Dent.', u'He said that "if Dent had been fired in Seattle or Milwaukee, this would have been just another event in an endless line of George\'s jettisons.', u'But it happened in Boston and the nightly news had its hook."', u'"The firing was only special because ... it\'s the first time a Yankee manager\u2014who was also a Red Sox demon\u2014was purged on the ancient Indian burial grounds of the Back Bay."', u'=== 1992\u20132001 ===\n\nTom Yawkey died in 1976, and his wife Jean R. Yawkey took control of the team until her death in 1992.', u'Their initials are shown in two stripes on the left field wall in Morse code.', u"Upon Jean's death, control of the team passed to the Yawkey Trust, led by John Harrington.", u'The trust sold the team in 2002, concluding 70 years of Yawkey ownership.', u'In 1994, General Manager Lou Gorman was replaced by Dan Duquette, a Massachusetts native who had worked for the Montreal Expos.', u"Duquette revived the team's farm system, which during his tenure produced players such as Nomar Garciaparra, Carl Pavano and David Eckstein.", u'Duquette also spent money on free agents, notably an 8-year, $160 million deal for Manny Ram\xedrez after the 2000 season.', u'The Red Sox won the newly realigned American League East in 1995, finishing seven games ahead of the Yankees.', u'However, they were swept in three games in the ALDS by the Cleveland Indians.', u'Their postseason losing streak reached 13 straight games, dating back to the 1986 World Series.', u'Roger Clemens tied his major league record by fanning 20 Detroit Tigers on September 18, 1996 in what would prove to be one of his final appearances in a Red Sox uniform.', u'After Clemens had turned 30 and then had four seasons, 1993\u201396, which were by his standards mediocre at best, Duquette said the pitcher was entering "the twilight of his career".', u'Clemens went on to pitch well for another ten years and win four more Cy Young Awards.', u'Out of contention in 1997, the team traded closer Heathcliff Slocumb to Seattle for catching prospect Jason Varitek and right-handed pitcher Derek Lowe.', u'Prior to the start of the 1998 season, the Red Sox dealt pitchers Tony Armas, Jr. and Carl Pavano to the Montreal Expos for pitcher Pedro Mart\xednez.', u"Mart\xednez became the anchor of the team's pitching staff and turned in several outstanding seasons.", u'In 1998, the team won the American League Wild Card, but again lost the American League Division Series to the Indians.', u'In 1999, Duquette called Fenway Park "economically obsolete" and, along with Red Sox ownership, led a push for a new stadium.', u'On the field, the 1999 Red Sox were finally able to overturn their fortunes against the Indians.', u'Cleveland took a 2\u20130 series lead, but Boston won the next three games behind strong pitching by Derek Lowe, Pedro Mart\xednez and his brother Ram\xf3n Mart\xednez.', u"Game 4's 23\u20137 win by the Red Sox was the highest-scoring playoff game in major league history.", u"Game 5 began with the Indians taking a 5\u20132 lead after two innings, but Pedro Mart\xednez, nursing a shoulder injury, came on in the fourth inning and pitched six innings without allowing a hit while the team's offense rallied for a 12\u20138 win behind two home runs and seven RBIs from outfielder Troy O'Leary.", u'After the ALDS victory, the Red Sox lost the American League Championship Series to the Yankees, four games to one.', u'The one bright spot was a lopsided win for the Red Sox in the much-hyped Martinez-Clemens game.', u'=== 2002\u2013present: John Henry era ===\n\n\n==== 2002\u201303 ====\n\nIn 2002, the Red Sox were sold by Yawkey trustee and president Harrington to New England Sports Ventures, a consortium headed by principal owner John Henry.', u'Tom Werner served as executive chairman, Larry Lucchino served as president and CEO, and serving as vice chairman was Les Otten.', u'Dan Duquette was fired as GM of the club on February 28, with former Angels GM Mike Port taking the helm for the 2002 season.', u'A week later, manager Joe Kerrigan was fired and was replaced by Grady Little.', u'While nearly all offseason moves were made under Duquette, such as signing outfielder Johnny Damon away from the Oakland Athletics, the new ownership made additions such as outfielder Cliff Floyd and relief pitcher Alan Embree.', u'Nomar Garciaparra, Manny Ram\xedrez, and Floyd all hit well, while Pedro Mart\xednez put up his usual outstanding numbers.', u'Derek Lowe, newly converted into a starter, won 20 games\u2014becoming the first player to save 20 games and win 20 games in back-to-back seasons.', u'After failing to reach the playoffs, Port was replaced by Yale University graduate Theo Epstein.', u'Epstein, raised in Brookline, Massachusetts, and just 28 at the time of his hiring, became the youngest general manager in MLB history.', u'The 2003 team was known as the "Cowboy Up" team, a nickname derived from first baseman Kevin Millar\'s challenge to his teammates to show more determination.', u'In the 2003 American League Division Series, the Red Sox rallied from a 0\u20132 series deficit against the Athletics to win the best-of-five series.', u'Derek Lowe returned to his former relief pitching role to save Game 5, a 4\u20133 victory.', u'The team then faced the Yankees in the 2003 American League Championship Series.', u'In Game 7, Boston led 5\u20132 in the eighth inning, but Pedro Mart\xednez allowed three runs to tie the game.', u'The Red Sox could not score off Mariano Rivera over the last three innings and eventually lost the game 6\u20135 when Yankee third baseman Aaron Boone hit a solo home run off of Tim Wakefield.', u'Some placed the blame for the loss on manager Grady Little for failing to remove starting pitcher Mart\xednez in the 8th inning after some observers believe he began to show signs of tiring.', u"Others credited Little with the team's successful season and dramatic come-from-behind victory in the ALDS.", u"Nevertheless, Boston's management did not renew Little's contract, and hired former Philadelphia Phillies manager Terry Francona.", u'==== "The Idiots": 2004 World Series Championship ====\n\nDuring the 2003\u201304 offseason, the Red Sox acquired another ace pitcher, Curt Schilling, and a closer, Keith Foulke.', u'Due to some midseason struggles with injuries, management shook up the team at the July 31 trading deadline as part of a four-team trade.', u"The Red Sox traded the team's popular, yet oft-injured, shortstop Nomar Garciaparra and outfielder Matt Murton to the Chicago Cubs, and received first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz from the Minnesota Twins, and shortstop Orlando Cabrera from the Montreal Expos.", u'In a separate transaction, the Red Sox acquired center fielder Dave Roberts from the Los Angeles Dodgers.', u'Following the trades, the club won 22 out of 25 games and qualified for the playoffs as the AL Wild Card.', u'Players and fans affectionately referred to the players as "the Idiots", a term coined by Damon and Millar during the playoff push to describe the team\'s eclectic roster and devil-may-care attitude toward their supposed "curse."', u'Boston began the postseason by sweeping the AL West champion Anaheim Angels in the ALDS.', u"In the third game of the series, David Ortiz hit a walk-off two-run homer in the 10th inning to win the game and the series to advance to a rematch of the previous year's ALCS in the ALCS against the Yankees.", u'The ALCS started very poorly for the Red Sox, as they lost the first three games (including a crushing 19-8 home loss in game 3).', u'In Game 4, the Red Sox found themselves facing elimination, trailing 4\u20133 in the ninth with Mariano Rivera in to close for the Yankees.', u'After Rivera issued a walk to Millar, Roberts came on to pinch run and promptly stole second base.', u'He then scored on an RBI single by Bill Mueller, sending the game into extra innings.', u'The Red Sox went on to win the game on a two-run home run by Ortiz in the 12th inning, who also made the walk-off hit in the 14th inning of game 5.', u'The comeback continued with a victory from an injured Schilling in game 6.', u"Three sutures being used to stabilize the tendon in Schilling's right ankle bled throughout the game, famously making his sock appear bloody red.", u'The Red Sox completed their historic comeback in game 7 with a 10-3 defeat of the Yankees.', u'Ortiz, who had the game-winning RBIs in Games 4 and 5, was named ALCS Most Valuable Player.', u'The Red Sox joined the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs and 1975 New York Islanders as the only professional sports teams in history at the time to win a best-of-seven games series after being down three games to none.', u'The 2009\u201310 Philadelphia Flyers (against the Boston Bruins) and the 2013\u201314 Los Angeles Kings (against the San Jose Sharks) would also accomplish the feat.', u'The Red Sox swept the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2004 World Series.', u"The Red Sox never trailed throughout the series; Mark Bellhorn's hit a game-winning home run off Pesky's Pole in game 1, and Schilling pitched another bloodied-sock victory in game 2, followed by similarly masterful pitching performances by Martinez and Derek Lowe.", u"It was the Red Sox' first championship in 86 years.", u'Manny Ram\xedrez was named World Series MVP.', u"To add a final, surreal touch to Boston's championship season, on the night of Game 4 a total lunar eclipse colored the moon red over Busch Stadium.", u'The Red Sox earned many accolades from the sports media and throughout the nation for their incredible season, such as in December, when Sports Illustrated named the Boston Red Sox the 2004 Sportsmen of the Year.', u'==== 2005\u201306 ====\n\nThe 2005 AL East would be decided on the last weekend of the season, with the Yankees coming to Fenway Park with a one-game lead in the standings.', u'The Red Sox won two of the three games to finish the season with the same record as the Yankees, 95\u201367.', u'However, a playoff was not needed, as the loser of such a playoff would still make the playoffs as a Wild Card team.', u'As the Yankees had won the season series, they were awarded the division title, and the Red Sox competed in the playoffs as the Wild Card.', u'Boston failed to defend their championship, and was swept in three games by the eventual 2005 World Series champion Chicago White Sox in the first round of the playoffs.', u'After the season, general manager Theo Epstein resigned rather than accept a contract extension.', u'In November 2005, the Red Sox announced the acquisition of pitcher Josh Beckett and third baseman Mike Lowell from the Florida Marlins, while sending several prospects including Hanley Ram\xedrez to the Marlins.', u'Fan-favorite Johnny Damon signed a 4-year, $52 million deal with the rival Yankees, whom he had earlier vowed never to play for.', u'The team filled the vacancy in center field by trading for Cleveland Indians center fielder Coco Crisp.', u'However, Crisp fractured his left index finger in April and would end up missing over 50 games in 2006.', u'Meanwhile, in January 2006, Epstein came to terms with the Red Sox and was once again named General Manager.', u"The revamped Red Sox infield, with third baseman Lowell joining new shortstop \xc1lex Gonz\xe1lez, second baseman Mark Loretta, and first baseman Kevin Youkilis (formerly the team's third baseman) was one of the best-fielding infields in baseball.", u'The Red Sox committed the fewest errors in the American League in 2006, and set a major league record of 17 consecutive errorless games.', u'One of the brightest spots of the 2006 season was the emergence of new closer Jonathan Papelbon, who became the first Red Sox rookie to be credited with 35 saves, earning an All-Star appearance.', u"Also, David Ortiz broke Jimmie Foxx's single season Red Sox home run record by hitting 54 homers.", u'However, Boston failed to make the playoffs after compiling a 9\u201321 record in the month of August due to injuries to catcher Jason Varitek, outfielder Trot Nixon, outfielder Manny Ram\xedrez, pitcher Tim Wakefield, rookie pitcher Jon Lester (who was diagnosed with lymphoma), and pitcher Matt Clement.', u"==== 2007: World Series Championship ====\n\nTheo Epstein's first step toward restocking the team for 2007 was to pursue one of the most anticipated acquisitions in baseball history.", u'On November 14, MLB announced that Boston had won the bid for the rights to negotiate a contract with Japanese Nippon Professional Baseball superstar pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka.', u'Boston placed a bid of $51.1 million to negotiate with Matsuzaka and completed a 6-year, $52 million contract after they were announced as the winning bid.', u'The Red Sox moved into first place in the AL East by mid-April and never relinquished their division lead.', u'Initially, rookie second baseman Dustin Pedroia under-performed, hitting below .200 in April.', u'Manager Terry Francona refused to bench him and his patience paid off as Pedroia eventually won the AL Rookie of the Year Award for his performance that season, which included 165 hits and a .317 batting average.', u'On the mound, Josh Beckett emerged as the ace of the staff with his first 20-win season, as fellow starting pitchers Schilling, Matsuzaka, Wakefield and Juli\xe1n Tav\xe1rez all struggled at times.', u'Relief pitcher Hideki Okajima, another recent arrival from the NPB, posted an ERA of 0.88 through the first half and was selected for the All-Star Game.', u"Okajima finished the season with a 2.22 ERA and 5 saves, emerging as one of baseball's top relievers.", u'Minor league call-up Clay Buchholz provided a spark on September 1 by pitching a no-hitter in his second career start.', u'The Red Sox captured their first AL East title since 1995.', u'The Red Sox swept the Angels in the ALDS.', u'Facing the Cleveland Indians in the ALCS, the Red Sox fell in games 2, 3, and 4 before Beckett picked up his second victory of the series in game 5, starting a comeback.', u'The Red Sox captured their twelfth American League pennant by outscoring the Indians 30\u20135 over the final three games.', u'The Red Sox faced the Colorado Rockies in the 2007 World Series, and swept the Rockies in four games.', u'In Game 4, Wakefield gave up his spot in the rotation to a recovered Jon Lester, who gave the Red Sox an impressive start, pitching 5\u2154 shutout innings.', u"Key home runs late in the game by third baseman Mike Lowell and pinch-hitter Bobby Kielty secured the Red Sox' second title in four years, as Lowell was named World Series MVP.", u'==== 2008\u20132012: Injuries and Collapses ====\n\nThe Red Sox struggled with injuries throughout the 2008 season.', u'Injuries to Schilling, relief pitcher Mike Timlin, and Beckett landed each pitcher on the disabled list before the 2008 season began, putting added pressure on young starters Lester and Buchholz.', u'Lester emerged as an anchor in the Red Sox rotation, leading the team in starts and innings pitched while compiling a 16\u20136 record and a 3.21 ERA.', u'Buchholz meanwhile struggled mightily in 2008 to a 2\u20139 record, ending up back in the minor leagues.', u"The Red Sox began their season by participating in the third opening day game in MLB history to be played in Japan, where they defeated the Oakland A's in the Tokyo Dome.", u'On May 19, Lester threw the 18th no-hitter in team history, defeating the Kansas City Royals 7\u20130.', u'However, despite early Red Sox success, the surprise Tampa Bay Rays led the AL East in early July.', u'Injuries would take a toll on the Red Sox offense during the season, most notably when David Ortiz missed 45 games with an injured wrist, Mike Lowell missed weeks with a torn hip labrum, and outfielder J. D. Drew aggravated a back injury that shelved him for much of the second half of the season.', u'Down the stretch, outfielder Manny Ramirez became embroiled in controversy surrounding public incidents with fellow players and other team employees, as well as criticism of ownership and not playing, which some claimed was due to laziness and nonexistent injuries.', u'The front office decided to move the disgrunted outfielder at the July 31 trade deadline, shipping him to the Dodgers in a three-way deal with the Pittsburgh Pirates that landed them Jason Bay to replace him in left field.', u'With Ramirez gone, and Bay providing a new spark in the lineup, the Red Sox improved vastly and made the playoffs as the AL Wild Card.', u'Ramirez ended up with the Los Angeles Dodgers.', u'Behind the strong playoff pitching of Lester, the Red Sox defeated the Angels in the 2008 ALDS three games to one.', u'The Red Sox then took on their AL East rivals the Tampa Bay Rays in the ALCS.', u'Down three games to one in the 5th game of the ALCS, Boston mounted a comeback from trailing 7-0 in the 7th inning to win 8-7.', u'They tied the series at 3 games apiece with a game 6 victory before losing game 7, 3\u20131, thus becoming the eighth team in a row since 2000 to fail to repeat as world champions.', u'In 2009, the Red Sox got into a rough start, but then won eleven games in a row.', u'During the first half of the season, star slugger David Ortiz had a very bad slump with a .185 average and one sole home run.', u"In response to poor offensive performance and to make room for Jed Lowrie's return from injury, shortstop Julio Lugo was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for cash and two minor-league players were traded to the Pirates for first baseman Adam LaRoche on July 22, who was soon traded to the Atlanta Braves for Casey Kotchman.", u'The Red Sox made a big move at the July 31 trade deadline, acquiring catcher Victor Martinez from the Cleveland Indians for three pitchers.', u'The Red Sox lost the last six games of the 2009 season to place the team second in the AL East, with the Yankees (who would later win the World Series).', u'The Red Sox entered the playoffs via the Wild Card, but were swept by the Los Angeles Angels in three games.', u"The Red Sox' 2010 season was highlighted by its many injuries to its players despite new additions to the team such as starting pitcher John Lackey, outfielder Mike Cameron and infielder Marco Scutaro.", u'Matsuzaka, Pedroia, and Youkilis ended the season early to recover their health, and Ellsbury spent most of the season on the bench due to injuries.', u'The Red Sox missed the playoffs for the first time since 2006, finishing in third place in the AL East.', u'After the season, Lowell decided to retire.', u'The Red Sox acquired superstar first baseman Adrian Gonzalez in a trade with the San Diego Padres and signed speedy outfielder Carl Crawford as an attempt to help the team return to the playoffs.', u'Entering the 2011 season, expectations were sky high and some baseball analysts even went as far as comparing the 2011 Red Sox to the legendary 1927 Yankees.', u'Despite the positive preseason predictions, the Red Sox struggled early in 2011, falling to an 0-6 start for the first time since 1945.', u'However, they gradually made their way into playoff contention by July, thanks to a potent offense which made up for a decimated pitching staff.', u'Matsuzaka and Buchholz ended their season with injuries, while new additions such as Andrew Miller, Alfredo Aceves and relief pitcher Daniel Bard proved their worth filling in for injured pitchers.', u'After rookie pitcher Kyle Weiland proved ineffective, the Red Sox made a three-way trade, giving up some prospects for \xc9rik B\xe9dard.', u'Due to further injuries in September, the Red Sox lost 11 out of 14 in that month, and their postseason aspirations were ultimately destroyed on September 28, 2011, losing to the Orioles by a score of 4\u20133 while the Rays clinched the American League Wild Card with a win over the Yankees on the same night.', u'The Red Sox missed the playoffs in consecutive seasons for the first time since missing three straight postseasons from 2000 to 2002.', u"Following the season, the Red Sox declined to exercise Terry Francona's 2012 contract option.", u"After the season, there was much controversy when it was claimed that the clubhouse didn't have solid leadership.", u'On some days, starting pitchers Lackey, Beckett, and Lester spent time in the dugout drinking.', u'Lester and the rest of the responsible pitchers stressed that they were only drinking when they had the day off pitching.', u'After the tumultuous end of the season, Theo Epstein left for the Chicago Cubs and was replaced by his previous assistant, Ben Cherington.', u'In December 2011, Bobby Valentine was hired as a new manager.', u'At about the same time, longtime closer Papelbon signed with the Philadelphia Phillies rather than re-sign with the Red Sox.', u"The 2012 season marked the centennial of Fenway Park, and on April 20, past and present Red Sox players and coaches assembled to celebrate the park's anniversary.", u'However, the collapse that they endured in September 2011 carried over into the season.', u'The Red Sox struggled throughout the season due to injuries, inconsistent play, and off-field news.', u'Many attempts to better the team through trades and free agent signing failed.', u'Amidst rumors that Valentine and Youkilis were not getting along, the Red Sox traded Youkilis to the Chicago White Sox on June 24.', u'On August 25, the Red Sox sent struggling players Gonzalez, Beckett, Crawford and infielder Nick Punto to the Los Angeles Dodgers for James Loney and four minor league prospects.', u'In addition to the clubhouse drinking, Beckett was also heavily connected to another incident where some of the players attended his charity bowling game rather than the funeral for Johnny Pesky, a longtime Red Sox shortstop, manager, and coach who died on August 13.', u'Coupled with a bizarre and inconsistent season, the one-time ace became a pariah to Red Sox Nation.', u'The Red Sox, realizing that the postseason was not in reach, decided to build with talent from their minor league system.', u'Over the next few months, minor league callups Will Middlebrooks, Pedro Ciriaco, Ryan Lavarnway and Daniel Nava were making regular appearances for the Red Sox.', u'The Red Sox finished 69\u201393 for their first losing season since 1997, and their worst season since 1965.', u'Bobby Valentine was subsequently fired on October 4, 2012.', u'Valentine has been replaced by John Farrell, who had spent the previous two seasons as manager of the Toronto Blue Jays.', u'Farrell was the pitching coach for the Red Sox from 2007\u20132010 before becoming manager of the Blue Jays.', u'==== Boston Strong: 2013 World Series Champions ====\n\nBoston, which finished last in the American League East with a 69\u201393 record in 2012\u201326 games behind the Yankees, became the 11th team in major league history to go from worst in the division to first the next season when it clinched the A.L.', u'East division title on September 21, 2013.', u"Many credit the team's turn around with the hiring of manager John Farrell, the former Red Sox pitching coach under Terry Francona from 2007 to 2010.", u'As a former member of the staff, he had the respect of influential players such as Lester, Pedroia, and Ortiz.', u'But there were other moves made in the offseason by general manager Ben Cherington who targeted "character" players to fill the team\'s needs.', u'These acquisitions included veteran catcher David Ross, Jonny Gomes, Mike Napoli, and Shane Victorino.', u'While some questioned these players as "re-treads", it was clear that Cherington was trying to move past 2011\u20132012 by bringing in "clubhouse players".', u'Essential to the turn around, however, was the pitching staff.', u'With ace veteran John Lackey coming off Tommy John surgery and both Jon Lester and Clay Buchholz returning to their prior form, this allowed the team to rely less on their bullpen.', u'Everything seemed in danger of collapsing, however, when both closers, Joel Hanrahan and Andrew Bailey, went down early with season-ending injuries.', u'Farrell gave the closing job to Koji Uehara on June 21 who delivered with a 1.09 ERA and an MLB record 0.565 WHIP.', u'On September 11, the 37-year-old right-hander set a new Red Sox record when he retired 33 straight batters.', u'Other reasons include the trade deadline acquisition of pitcher Jake Peavy when the Red Sox were in second place in the AL East, the depth of the bench with players such as Mike Carp and rookies Jackie Bradley, Jr. and Xander Bogaerts, and the re-emergence of players such as Will Middlebrooks and Daniel Nava.', u'On September 28, 2013, the team secured home field advantage throughout the American League playoffs when their closest competition, the Oakland Athletics, lost.', u'The next day, the team finished the season going 97\u201365, the best record in the American League and tied with the St. Louis Cardinals for the best record in baseball.', u'They proceeded to defeat the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2013 World Series, four games to two.', u'The Red Sox became the first team since the 1991 Minnesota Twins to win the World Series a year after finishing in last place, and the second overall.', u"The 2012 Red Sox' .426 winning percentage was the lowest for a team in a season prior to a World Series championship.", u'Throughout the season, the Red Sox players and organization formed a close association with the city of Boston and its people in relation to the Boston Marathon bombings that occurred on April 15, 2013.', u'On April 20, the day after the alleged bombers were captured, David Ortiz gave a pre-game speech following a ceremony honoring the victims and the local law enforcement, in which he stated, "This is our fucking city!', u'And nobody is going to dictate our freedom!', u'Stay strong!".', u'For the entirety of the season, the team wore an additional arm patch that exhibited the Red Sox "B" logo and the word "Strong" within a blue circle.', u'The team also hung up in the dugout a custom jersey that read "Boston Strong" with the number 617, representing the city of Boston\'s area code.', u'On many occasions during the season, victims of the attack and law enforcement involved were given the honor of throwing the ceremonial first pitch.', u"Following their victory in the 2013 World Series, the first one clinched at home in Fenway Park since 1918, Red Sox players Jonny Gomes and Jarrod Saltalamacchia performed a ceremony during the team's traditional duck boat victory parade, in which they placed the World Series trophy and the custom 617 jersey on the Boston Marathon finish line on Boylston Street, followed by a moment of silence and a singing of God Bless America.", u'This ceremony helped the city "reclaim" its spirit that was lost after the bombing.', u"Overall, the Red Sox team and organization played a role in the healing process after the tragedy, owing to the team's unifying effect on the city.", u"==== 2014 season ====\n\nGone from Boston's roster were core 2013 players such as center fielder Jacoby Ellsbury, catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia, and pitcher Ryan Dempster.", u'To help replace their needs, the Red Sox added catcher A. J. Pierzynski and outfielder Grady Sizemore, while also calling up young stars, outfielder Jackie Bradley Jr. and third baseman Xander Bogaerts.', u'During the season, the Red Sox struggled and released a number of veteran players including Sizemore, Pierzynski, and Chris Capuano while promoting top prospects such as Christian Vazquez and Mookie Betts.', u'At the end of July, the Red Sox traded away a number of members of the 2013 team: F\xe9lix Doubront, Jake Peavy, John Lackey, Jonny Gomes, Stephen Drew, and Jon Lester.', u'On September 10, the Red Sox were officially eliminated from the postseason, marking the fourth time in five seasons they did not qualify for the playoffs despite winning the World Series in the one year they did.', u'==== 2015 season ====\n\nPrior to the season, the Red Sox signed two major free agents: former Red Sox prospect Hanley Ram\xedrez to a four-year $80 million contract and former World Series MVP Pablo Sandoval to a five-year $100 million contract.', u'Later that offseason, the Red Sox signed another former prospect in starter Justin Masterson one-year $9.5 million deal.', u"The rebuilding wasn't done, as the Red Sox traded Allen Webster and Rubby De La Rosa to the Arizona Diamondbacks for left-handed starter Wade Miley on December 10, Yoenis C\xe9spedes, Alex Wilson and a prospect to the Detroit Tigers for right-hander Rick Porcello on December 11 and Will Middlebrooks to the San Diego Padres for catcher Ryan Hanigan on December 17.", u'The team also hired Chili Davis to be the new hitting coach.', u'Despite the active offseason, it was a tumultuous season for the Red Sox.', u'The team quickly fell to the bottom of the American League East, with criticism levied particularly at the rebuilt pitching staff.', u'On May 6, pitching coach Juan Nieves was relieved of his duties and replaced by Carl Willis.', u"Things didn't improve, however, and went from bad to worse in August when manager John Farrell announced he had cancer and was temporarily stepping down.", u'Bench coach Torey Lovullo took over managerial duties for the remainder of the season.', u'Ben Cherington was fired in August and replaced by former Marlins and Tigers GM Dave Dombrowski.', u'More pieces of the 2013 team moved on, with Shane Victorino, Daniel Nava and Mike Napoli all departing during the season.', u'In September, longtime president and CEO Larry Lucchino announced he was leaving the club.', u'In late September, the New England Sports Network announced popular longtime broadcaster Don Orsillo would not be offered a contract extension and leaving after the season, leading to fan protests.', u'Throughout the season, Sandoval and Ram\xedrez were criticized for not performing up to their large contracts.', u'Ram\xedrez, originally signed to be the everyday left fielder, was demoted from the outfield due to defensive difficulties.', u'Rick Porcello, who during the season became the highest-paid pitcher in team history, was also singled out for criticism.', u'Despite the negatives, Mookie Betts, Jackie Bradley, Jr., Xander Bogaerts, and Travis Shaw emerged as stars and Eduardo Rodr\xedguez as a frontline starter.', u'David Ortiz also hit his 500th career home run during the season.', u"==== 2016 season ====\n\nDave Dombrowski's first offseason in charge led to the Red Sox making a big splash, signing left-handed pitcher David Price.", u'A Cy Young winner and five time All-Star, Price signed for seven years and $217 million \u2013 the largest contract for a starting pitcher in baseball history.', u'Dombrowski also added bullpen help, trading Wade Miley and Jonathan Aro to the Seattle Mariners for Carson Smith and Roenis Elias, as well as trading top prospects Javier Guerra, Manuel Margot, Logan Allen and Carlos Asuaje to the San Diego Padres for Craig Kimbrel, one of the best closers in baseball.', u'The Red Sox also added outfielder Chris Young to shore up the bench.', u'== Current roster ==\n\n\n== Uniform ==\n\n\n== Spring training ==\n\n\n=== Truck Day ===\nThe unofficial beginning of the spring training season for the Red Sox is Truck Day, the day a tractor-trailer filled with equipment leaves Fenway Park bound for the Sox spring training facility in Florida.', u'Truck Day 2016 takes place on Wednesday, February 10, 2016.', u'=== City of Palms Park ===\nFormer left fielder Mike Greenwell is from Fort Myers, Florida and was instrumental in bringing his team to the city for spring training.', u'City of Palms Park was built in 1992 for that purpose and holds 8,000 people.', u'It is also the home of the Red Sox Rookie team, the Gulf Coast League Red Sox, from April through June.', u'=== JetBlue Park ===\nOn October 28, 2008, the Lee County commission voted 3\u20131 to approve an agreement with the Boston Red Sox to build a new spring-training facility for the team in south Lee County.', u'Commissioner Brian Bigelow was the lone dissenting vote.', u'Commissioner Bob Janes was not present for the vote, but stated that he supported it.', u'Dee was present in the chambers for the vote, and took the agreement back to Boston to meet with John Henry and other team officials.', u'On November 1, 2008, the Red Sox signed an agreement with Lee County that will keep their spring training home in the Fort Myers area for 30 more years.', u'Wednesday, April 30, 2009, the Lee County commissioners selected the Watermen-Pinnacle site on Daniels Parkway (a little more than a mile east of Interstate 75) as the site for the new facility.', u'The backup choice, if negotiations between county staff and the developer falter, is the University Highland site just north of Germain Arena in Estero.', u'Jeff Mudgett, a Fort Myers architect who is volunteering his time toward the project, envisions a facility with a mini-Fenway Park that would open for Spring 2012.', u'On March 29, 2011, it was announced that the new field would be named JetBlue Park at Fenway South.', u"The park was named JetBlue Park after JetBlue Airlines, which has maintained major operations at Boston's Logan International Airport since 2004.", u'Many characteristics of the stadium will be taken from Fenway Park, including a 37-foot (11 m) Green Monster wall in left field, featuring seating on top of and behind the wall.', u'Included in the wall will be a restored version of the manual scoreboard that was housed at Fenway for almost 30 years, beginning in the 1970s.', u'The field dimensions at JetBlue Park will be identical to those at Fenway.', u'== Rivalry with the Yankees ==\n\nThe Yankees\u2013Red Sox rivalry is one of the oldest, most famous and fiercest rivalries in professional sports.', u'For over 100 years, the Red Sox and New York Yankees have been rivals.', u'The rivalry is often a heated subject of conversation in the Northeastern United States.', u'Since the inception of the wild card team and an added Division Series, every playoffs has featured one or both of the American League East rivals and they both have squared off in the American League Championship Series three times, with the Yankees winning twice in 1999 and 2003 and the Sox winning in 2004.', u'In addition, the teams have twice met in the last regular-season series of a season to decide the league title, in 1904 (when the Red Sox won) and 1949 (when the Yankees won).', u'The teams also finished tied for first in 1978, when the Yankees won a high-profile one-game playoff for the division title.', u'The 1978 division race is memorable for the Red Sox having held a 14-game lead over the Yankees more than halfway through the season.', u'Similarly, the 2004 AL Championship Series is notable for the Yankees leading 3 games to 0 and ultimately losing a best of seven series.', u'The Red Sox comeback was the only time in baseball history that a team has come back from a 0\u20133 deficit to win a series.', u'The rivalry is often termed "the best" and "greatest rivalry in all of sports."', u'Games between the two teams often generate a great deal of interest and get extensive media coverage, including being broadcast on national television.', u'== Radio and television ==\n\nCurrently, the flagship radio station of the Red Sox is WEEI-FM/93.7.', u"Joe Castiglione, in his 25th year as the voice of the Red Sox, serves as the lead play-by-play announcer, along with Dave O'Brien and Jon Rish.", u"Some of Castiglione's predecessors include Curt Gowdy, Ken Coleman, and Ned Martin.", u'He has also worked with play-by-play veterans Bob Starr and Jerry Trupiano.', u'Many stations throughout New England and beyond pick up the broadcasts.', u'All Red Sox telecasts not shown nationally on Fox or ESPN are seen on New England Sports Network (NESN), until 2015 with Don Orsillo calling play-by-play and Jerry Remy, former Red Sox second baseman, as color analyst.', u"At the start of the 2016 season, Dave O'Brien took over the play-by-play duties.", u"During Remy's recovery from cancer, former Red Sox players Dennis Eckersley and Dave Roberts have alternated doing color commentary.", u'NESN became exclusive in 2006; before then, games were shown on such local stations as the original WHDH-TV, WNAC-TV (now the current WHDH), WBZ-TV, WSBK-TV, WLVI, WABU, and WFXT at various points in team history.', u'== Retired numbers ==\n\nThe Red Sox used to publish on their website and their annual media guides three official requirements for a player to have his number retired:\nElection to the National Baseball Hall of Fame\nAt least 10 years played with the Red Sox\nFinished his career with the club.', u'These requirements were reconsidered after the election of Carlton Fisk to the Hall of Fame in 2000; who met the first 2 requirements but played the second half of his career with the White Sox.', u'As a means of meeting the criteria, then-GM Dan Duquette hired Fisk for one day as a special assistant, which allowed Fisk to technically finish his career with the Red Sox.', u'In 2008, the Red Sox made an "exception" by retiring #6 for Johnny Pesky.', u'Pesky neither spent ten years as a player nor was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame; however, Red Sox ownership cited "... his versatility of his contributions\u2014on the field, off the field, [and] in the dugout ...", including as a manager, scout, and special instructor and decided that the honor had been well-earned.', u'Pesky spent 55 years with the Red Sox organization; as a player (1942, 1946-1952), minor league manager (1961-1962, 1990), major league manager (1963-1964, 1980), broadcaster (1969-1974), major league coach (1975-1984), and as a special instructor and assistant general manager (1985-2012).', u"In 2015, the Red Sox chose to forgo the official criteria and retire Pedro Mart\xednez's #45.", u'Mart\xednez only spent 7 of his 18 seasons in Boston.', u'In justifying the number\'s retirement, Red Sox principal owner John Henry stated, "To be elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame upon his first year of eligibility speaks volumes regarding Pedro\'s outstanding career, and is a testament to the respect and admiration so many in baseball have for him."', u'After which, the official criteria no longer appeared on the team website nor future media guides.', u"During pre-game ceremonies in honor of the final game of David Ortiz's career on October 2, 2016, the Red Sox announced that they will retire #34 in Ortiz's honor at a ceremony during the 2017 season.", u'The number 42 was officially retired by Major League Baseball in 1997, but Mo Vaughn was one of a handful of players to continue wearing #42 through a grandfather clause.', u'He last wore it for the team in 1998.', u'In commemoration of Jackie Robinson Day, MLB invited players to wear the number 42 for games played on April 15, Coco Crisp (CF), David Ortiz (DH), and DeMarlo Hale (Coach) did that in 2007 and again in 2008.', u'Starting in 2009, MLB had all uniformed players for all teams wear #42 for Jackie Robinson Day.', u'While not officially retired, the Red Sox have not issued several numbers since the departure of prominent figures who wore them, specifically:\n21: Roger Clemens RHP (1984\u20131996).', u'33: Jason Varitek C (1997\u20132011); retired as member of Red Sox.', u'49: Tim Wakefield RHP (1995\u20132011); retired as member of Red Sox.', u"There has also been debate in Boston media circles and among fans about the potential retiring of Tony Conigliaro's number 25.", u"Nonetheless, since Conigliaro's last full season in Boston, 1970, the number has been assigned to 15 individuals, including players Orlando Cepeda, Mark Clear, Don Baylor, Larry Parrish, Jack Clark, Troy O'Leary, Jeremy Giambi and Mike Lowell; coach Dwight Evans, and manager Bobby Valentine.", u'#25 is currently worn by OF Jackie Bradley, Jr.\nUntil the late 1990s, the numbers originally hung on the right-field facade in the order in which they were retired: 9\u20134\u20131\u20138.', u'It was pointed out that the numbers, when read as a date (9/4/18), marked the eve of the first game of the 1918 World Series, the last championship series that the Red Sox won before 2004.', u'After the facade was repainted, the numbers were rearranged in numerical order.', u"In 2012, the numbers were rearranged again in chronological order of retirement (9, 4, 1, 8, 27, 6, 14, 45, 26) followed by Robinson's 42.", u'== Baseball Hall of Famers ==\n\n\n=== Ford C. Frick Award recipients ===\n\n\n== Minor league affiliations ==\n\n\n== Other notable seasons and team records ==\n\nNomar Garciaparra hit .372 in 2000, the club record for a right-handed hitter.', u'David Ortiz in 2005 had 47 home runs and 148 RBIs.', u"He also had many game winning and timely hits and came in second in the MVP voting to the New York Yankees' Alex Rodriguez.", u'David Ortiz had a franchise record-breaking 2006 season with 54 home runs in the regular season\nOn April 22, 2007, Manny Ram\xedrez, J. D.

{'sentences': [u'Eton College /i\u02d0t\u0259n/ is an independent boarding school for boys in Eton, Berkshire, near Windsor.', u'It educates more than 1,300 pupils, aged 13 to 18 years.', u'It was founded in 1440 by King Henry VI as "The King\'s College of Our Lady of Eton besides Wyndsor", making it the 18th oldest Headmasters\' and Headmistresses\' Conference (HMC) school.', u'Eton is one of ten English HMC schools, commonly referred to as "public schools", regulated by the Public Schools Act of 1868.', u"Following the public school tradition, Eton is a full boarding school, which means all pupils live at the school, and it is one of four such remaining single-sex boys' public schools in the United Kingdom (the others being Harrow, Radley, and Winchester) to continue this practice.", u"Eton has educated 19 British prime ministers and generations of the aristocracy and has been referred to as the chief nurse of England's statesmen.", u'Charging up to \xa311,478 per term (there are three terms per academic year) in 2014/15, Eton is the sixth most expensive HMC boarding school in the UK.', u'== Background ==\nEton has a long list of distinguished former pupils.', u'David Cameron was the 19th British prime minister to have attended the school, and recommended that Eton set up a school in the state sector to help drive up standards.', u'Eton now co-sponsors a state sixth-form college in Newham, a deprived area of East London, called the London Academy of Excellence, opened in 2012, which is free of charge and aims to get all its students into higher education.', u'In September 2014, Eton opened, and became the sole educational sponsor for, a new purpose-built co-educational state boarding and day school for around 500 pupils, Holyport College, in Maidenhead in Berkshire, with construction costing around \xa315 million, in which a fifth of places for day pupils will be set aside for children from poor homes, 21 boarding places will go to youngsters on the verge of being taken into care, and a further 28 boarders will be funded or part-funded through bursaries.', u'About 20% of pupils at Eton receive financial support, through a range of bursaries and scholarships.', u'The recent Head Master, Tony Little, said that Eton is developing plans to allow any boy to attend the school whatever his parents\' income and, in 2011, said that around 250 boys received "significant" financial help from the school.', u'In early 2014, this figure had risen to 263 pupils receiving the equivalent of around 60% of school fee assistance, whilst a further 63 received their education free of charge.', u'Little said that, in the short term, he wanted to ensure that around 320 pupils per year receive bursaries, and that 70 were educated free of charge, with the intention that the number of pupils receiving financial assistance would continue to increase.', u'These comparatively new developments will run alongside long-established courses that Eton has provided for pupils from state schools, most of them in the summer holidays (July and August).', u'Launched in 1982, the Universities Summer School is an intensive residential course open to boys and girls throughout the UK who attend state schools, are at the end of their first year in the Sixth Form, and are about to begin their final year of schooling.', u'The Brent-Eton Summer School, started in 1994, offers 40\u201350 young people from the London Borough of Brent, an area of inner-city deprivation, an intensive one-week residential course, free of charge, designed to help bridge the gap between GCSE and A-level.', u'In 2008, Eton helped found the Eton, Slough, Windsor and Hounslow Independent and State School Partnership (ISSP), with six local state schools.', u'The ISSP\'s aims are "to raise pupil achievement, improve pupil self-esteem, raise pupil aspirations and improve professional practice across the schools".', u'Eton also runs a number of choral and English language courses during the summer months.', u"In the run-up to the London 2012 Summer Olympic Games and London 2012 Summer Paralympic Games, Eton's purpose-built Dorney Lake, a permanent, eight-lane, 2,200 metre course (about 1.4 miles) in a 400-acre park, officially known throughout the Games as Eton Dorney, provided training facilities for Olympic and Paralympic competitors, and during the Games, hosted the Olympic and Paralympic Rowing competitions as well as the Olympic Canoe Sprint event, attracting over 400,000 visitors during the Games period (around 30,000 per day), and voted the best 2012 Olympic venue by spectators.", u'Access to the parkland around the Lake is provided to members of the public, free of charge, almost all the year round.', u'In the past, Eton has educated generations of British and foreign aristocracy, and for the first time, members of the Royal family, Prince William and his brother Prince Harry, in contrast to the Royal tradition of male education at either naval college or Gordonstoun, or by Palace tutors.', u"Registration at birth has been consigned to the past, and by the mid-1990s, Eton ranked among Britain's top three schools in getting its pupils into Oxford and Cambridge.", u'Eton has traditionally been referred to as "the chief nurse of England\'s statesmen", and has been described as the most famous public school in the world.', u'Early in the 20th century, a historian of Eton wrote, "No other school can claim to have sent forth such a cohort of distinguished figures to make their mark on the world."', u'The Good Schools Guide called the school "the number one boys\' public school", adding that "The teaching and facilities are second to none."', u'The school is a member of the G20 Schools Group.', u'== Overview ==\nThe school is headed by a Provost and Fellows (Board of Governors), who appoint the head master.', u"It contains 25 boys' houses, each headed by a House Master, selected from the more senior members of the teaching staff, who number some 160.", u"Almost all of the school's pupils go on to universities, about a third of them to Oxford or Cambridge.", u"The Head Master is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference and the school is a member of the Eton Group of independent schools in the United Kingdom.", u'Eton today is a larger school than it has been for much of its history.', u'In 1678, there were 207 boys.', u'In the late 18th century, there were about 300, while today, the total has risen to over 1,300.', u"== History ==\n\nEton College was founded by King Henry VI as a charity school to provide free education to 70 poor boys who would then go on to King's College, Cambridge, founded by the same King in 1441.", u'Henry took Winchester College as his model, visiting on many occasions, borrowing its Statutes and removing its Headmaster and some of the Scholars to start his new school.', u'When Henry VI founded the school, he granted it a large number of endowments, including much valuable land.', u"The group of feoffees appointed by the king to receive forfeited lands of the Alien Priories for the endowment of Eton were as follows:\nArchbishop Chichele\nBishop Stafford\nBishop Lowe\nBishop Ayscough\nWilliam de la Pole, 1st Marquess of Suffolk (1396\u20131450) (later Duke of Suffolk)\nJohn Somerset (d. 1454), Chancellor of the Exchequer and the king's doctor\nThomas Beckington (c. 1390\u20131465), Archdeacon of Buckingham, the king's secretary and later Keeper of the Privy Seal\nRichard Andrew (d. 1477), first Warden of All Souls College, Oxford, later the king's secretary\nAdam Moleyns (d. 1450), Clerk of the Council\nJohn Hampton (d. 1472) of Kniver, Staffordshire, an Esquire of the Body\nJames Fiennes, another member of the Royal Household\nWilliam Tresham, another member of the Royal Household\nIt was intended to have formidable buildings (Henry intended the nave of the College Chapel to be the longest in Europe) and several religious relics, supposedly including a part of the True Cross and the Crown of Thorns.", u'He persuaded the then Pope, Eugene IV, to grant him a privilege unparalleled anywhere in England: the right to grant indulgences to penitents on the Feast of the Assumption.', u"The school also came into possession of one of England's Apocalypse manuscripts.", u"However, when Henry was deposed by King Edward IV in 1461, the new King annulled all grants to the school and removed most of its assets and treasures to St George's Chapel, Windsor, on the other side of the River Thames.", u"Legend has it that Edward's mistress, Jane Shore, intervened on the school's behalf.", u'She was able to save a good part of the school, although the royal bequest and the number of staff were much reduced.', u'Construction of the chapel, originally intended to be slightly over twice as long, with eighteen\u2014or possibly seventeen\u2014bays (there are eight today) was stopped when Henry VI was deposed.', u'Only the Quire of the intended building was completed.', u"Eton's first Headmaster, William Waynflete, founder of Magdalen College, Oxford and previously Head Master of Winchester College, built the ante-chapel that finishes the Chapel today.", u'The important wall paintings in the Chapel and the brick north range of the present School Yard also date from the 1480s; the lower storeys of the cloister, including College Hall, had been built between 1441 and 1460.', u'As the school suffered reduced income while still under construction, the completion and further development of the school has since depended to some extent on wealthy benefactors.', u'Building resumed when Roger Lupton was Provost, around 1517.', u'His name is borne by the big gate-house in the west range of the cloisters, fronting School Yard, perhaps the most famous image of the school.', u'This range includes the important interiors of the Parlour, Election Hall, and Election Chamber, where most of the 18th century "leaving portraits" are kept.', u'"After Lupton\'s time nothing important was built until about 1670, when Provost Allestree gave a range to close the west side of School Yard between Lower School and Chapel".', u'This was remodelled later and completed 1694 by Matthew Bankes, Master Carpenter of the Royal Works.', u'The last important addition to the central college buildings was the College Library, in the south range of the cloister, 1725\u201329, by Thomas Rowland.', u'It has a very important collection of books and manuscripts.', u'In the 19th century, the architect John Shaw Jr (1803\u20131870) became surveyor to Eton.', u"He designed New Buildings (1844\u201346), Provost Francis Hodgson's addition to provide better accommodation for Collegers, who until then had mostly lived in Long Chamber, a long first floor room where conditions were inhumane.", u'Following complaints about the finances, buildings and management of Eton, the Clarendon Commission was set up in 1861 as a Royal Commission to investigate the state of nine schools in England, including Eton.', u'Questioned by the Commission in 1862, head master Edward Balston came under attack for his view that in the classroom little time could be spared for subjects other than classical studies.', u'The Duke of Wellington is often incorrectly quoted as saying that "The Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing-fields of Eton".', u'Wellington was at Eton from 1781 to 1784 and was to send his sons there.', u'According to Nevill (citing the historian Sir Edward Creasy), what Wellington said, while passing an Eton cricket match many decades later, was, "There grows the stuff that won Waterloo", a remark Nevill construes as a reference to "the manly character induced by games and sport" among English youth generally, not a comment about Eton specifically.', u'In 1889, Sir William Fraser conflated this uncorroborated remark with the one attributed to him by Count Charles de Montalembert\'s "C\'est ici qu\'a \xe9t\xe9 gagn\xe9 la bataille de Waterloo" ("It is here that the Battle of Waterloo was won.")', u'As with other public schools, a scheme was devised towards the end of the 19th century to familiarize privileged schoolboys with social conditions in deprived areas.', u"The project of establishing an 'Eton Mission' in the crowded district of Hackney Wick in east London was started at the beginning of 1880, and lasted until 1971 when it was decided that a more local project (at Dorney) would be more realistic.", u"However over the years much money was raised for the Eton Mission, a fine church by G. F. Bodley was erected, many Etonians visited, and stimulated among other things the Eton Manor Boys' Club, a notable rowing club which has survived the Mission itself, and the 59 Club for motorcyclists.", u"The very large and ornate School Hall and School Library (by L. K. Hall) were erected in 1906\u201308 across the road from Upper School as the school's memorial to the Etonians who had died in the Boer War.", u'Many tablets in the cloisters and chapel commemorate the large number of dead Etonians of the Great War.', u'A bomb destroyed part of Upper School in World War II and blew out many windows in the Chapel.', u'The college commissioned replacements by Evie Hone (1949\u201352) and by John Piper and Patrick Reyntiens (1959 onward).', u'Among headmasters of the 20th century were Cyril Alington, Robert Birley and Anthony Chenevix-Trench.', u'M. R. James was a provost.', u"In 1959, the College constructed a nuclear bunker to house the College's Provost and Fellows.", u'The facility is now used for storage.', u'In 2005, the School was one of fifty of the country\'s leading independent schools found to have breached the Competition Act (see below under "Controversy").', u'In 2011, plans to attack Eton were found on the body of a senior al-Qaeda leader shot dead in Somalia.', u'In the past, people at Eton have occasionally been guilty of antisemitism.', u"For a time, new admissions were called 'Jews' by their fellow Collegers.", u"[5] In 1945, the school introduced a nationality statute conditioning entry on the applicant's father being British by birth.", u'The statute was removed after the intervention of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan in the 1960s after it came to the attention of Oxford\'s Wykeham Professor of Logic, A. J. Ayer, himself Jewish and an Old Etonian, who "suspected a whiff of anti-semitism".', u'== School terms ==\nThere are three academic terms (known as halves) in the year,\nThe Michaelmas Half, from early September to mid December.', u'New boys are now admitted only at the start of the Michaelmas Half, unless in exceptional circumstances.', u'The Lent Half, from mid-January to late March.', u'The Summer Half, from late April to late June or early July.', u'They are called halves because the school year was once split into two halves, between which the boys went home.', u"== Boys' houses ==\n\n\n=== King's Scholars ===\n\nOne boarding house, College, is reserved for 70 King's Scholars, who attend Eton on scholarships provided by the original foundation and awarded by examination each year; King's Scholars pay up to 90 percent of full fees, depending on their means.", u'Of the other pupils, up to a third receive some kind of bursary or scholarship.', u'The name "King\'s Scholars" is because the school was founded by King Henry VI in 1440.', u"The original School consisted of the 70 Scholars (together with some Commensals) and the Scholars were educated and boarded at the foundation's expense.", u'King\'s Scholars are entitled to use the letters "KS" after their name and they can be identified by a black gown worn over the top of their tailcoats, giving them the nickname tugs (Latin: togati, wearers of gowns); and occasionally by a surplice in Chapel.', u'The house is looked after by the Master in College.', u"=== Oppidans ===\nAs the School grew, more students were allowed to attend provided that they paid their own fees and lived in the town, outside the College's original buildings.", u'These students became known as Oppidans, from the Latin word oppidum, meaning town.', u'The Houses developed over time as a means of providing residence for the Oppidans in a more congenial manner, and during the 18th and 19th centuries were mostly run by women known as "dames".', u'They typically contain about fifty boys.', u'Although classes are organised on a School basis, most boys spend a large proportion of their time in their House.', u'Each House has a formal name, mainly used for post and people outside the Eton community.', u'It is generally known by the boys by the initials or surname of the House Master, the teacher who lives in the house and manages the pupils in it.', u"Not all boys who pass the College election examination choose to become King's Scholars.", u'If they choose instead to belong to one of the 24 Oppidan Houses, they are known as Oppidan Scholars.', u'Oppidan scholarships may also be awarded for consistently performing with distinction in School and external examinations.', u'To gain an Oppidan Scholarship, a boy must have either three distinctions in a row or four throughout his career.', u'Within the school, an Oppidan Scholar is entitled to use the letters OS after his name.', u"The Oppidan Houses are named Godolphin House, Jourdelay's, (both built as such c. 1720), Hawtrey House, Durnford House, (the first two built as such by the Provost and Fellows, 1845, when the school was increasing in numbers and needed more centralised control), The Hopgarden, South Lawn, Waynflete, Evans's, Keate House, Warre House, Villiers House, Common Lane House, Penn House, Walpole House, Cotton Hall, Wotton House, Holland House, Mustians, Angelo's, Manor House, Farrer House, Baldwin's Bec, The Timbralls, and Westbury.", u'=== House structure ===\n\nIn addition to the House Master, each house has a House Captain and a House Captain of Games.', u'Some Houses have more than one.', u'House prefects were once elected from the oldest year, but this no longer happens.', u"The old term, Library, survives in the name of the room set aside for the oldest year's use, where boys have their own kitchen.", u'Similarly, boys in their penultimate year have a room known as Debate.', u'There are entire house gatherings every evening, usually around 8:05\u20138:30 p.m.', u'These are known as Prayers, due to their original nature.', u'The House Master and boys have an opportunity to make announcements, and sometimes the boys provide light entertainment.', u'For much of Eton\'s history, junior boys had to act as "fags", or servants, to older boys.', u'Their duties included cleaning, cooking, and running errands.', u'A Library member was entitled to yell at any time and without notice, "Boy, Up!"', u'or "Boy, Queue!', u'", and all first-year boys had to come running.', u'The last boy to arrive was given the task.', u'These practices, known as fagging, were partially phased out of most houses in the 1970s.', u'Captains of House and Games still sometimes give tasks to first-year boys, such as collecting the mail from School Office.', u'There are many inter-house competitions, mostly in sports.', u'== Head Masters: 1442\u2013present ==\n\n\n== Uniform ==\n\nThe School is known for its traditions, including a uniform of black tailcoat (or morning coat) and waistcoat, false-collar and pinstriped trousers.', u'Most pupils wear a white tie that is effectively a strip of cloth folded over into a starched, detachable collar, but some senior boys are entitled to wear a white bow tie and winged collar ("Stick-Ups").', u"There are some variations in the school dress worn by boys in authority, see School Prefects and King's Scholars sections.", u'The long-standing claim that the present uniform was first worn as mourning for the death of George III is unfounded.', u'"Eton dress" has undergone significant changes since its standardisation in the 19th century.', u'Originally (along with a top-hat and walking-cane), Etonian dress was reserved for formal occasions, but boys wear it today for classes, which are referred to as "divisions", or "divs".', u"As stated above, King's Scholars wear a black gown over the top of their tailcoats, and occasionally a surplice in Chapel.", u'Members of the teaching staff (known as Beaks) are required to wear a form of school dress when teaching.', u'From 1820 until 1967, boys under the height of 5\'4" (1.63 m) were required to wear the \'Eton suit\', which replaced the tailcoat with the cropped \'Eton jacket\' (known colloquially as a "bum-freezer") and included an \'Eton collar\', a large, stiff-starched, white collar.', u'The Eton suit was copied by other schools and has remained in use in some, particularly choir schools.', u'== Tutors and teaching ==\nThe pupil to teacher ratio is 8:1, which is low by general school standards.', u'Class sizes start at around twenty to twenty-five in the first year and are often below ten by the final year.', u'The original curriculum concentrated on prayers, Latin and devotion, and "as late as 1530 no Greek was taught".', u'Later the emphasis was on classical studies, dominated by Latin and Ancient History, and, for boys with sufficient ability, Classical Greek.', u'From the latter part of the 19th century this curriculum has changed and broadened: for example, there are now more than 100 students of Chinese, which is a non-curriculum course.', u'In the 1970s, there was just one school computer, in a small room attached to the science buildings.', u'It used paper tape to store programs.', u"Today, all boys must have laptop computers, and the school fibre-optic network connects all classrooms and all boys' bedrooms to the internet.", u"The primary responsibility for a boy's studies lies with his House Master, but he is assisted by an additional director of studies, known as a tutor.", u'Classes, colloquially known as "divs" (divisions), are organised on a School basis; the classrooms are separate from the houses.', u'New school buildings have appeared for teaching purposes every decade or so since New Schools, designed by Henry Woodyer and built 1861\u201363.', u'Despite the introduction of modern technology, the external appearance and locations of many of the classrooms have remained unchanged for a long time.', u'Every evening, about an hour and a quarter, known as Quiet Hour, is set aside, during which boys are expected to study or prepare work for their teachers if not otherwise engaged.', u'Some Houses, at the discretion of the House Master, may observe a second Quiet Hour after prayers in the evening.', u"This is less formal, with boys being allowed to visit each other's rooms to socialise if neither boy has work outstanding.", u'The Independent Schools Inspectorate\'s latest report says, "Eton College provides an exceptionally good quality of education for all its pupils.', u'They achieve high academic standards as a result of stimulating teaching, challenging expectations and first-class resources."', u"== Societies ==\nAt Eton, there are dozens of organisations known as 'societies', in many of which pupils come together to discuss a particular topic, presided over by a master, and often including a guest speaker.", u'At any one time there are about fifty societies and clubs in existence, catering for a wide range of interests and largely run by boys.', u'Societies tend to come and go, depending on the special enthusiasms of the masters and boys in the school at the time, but some have been in existence many years.', u'Those in existence at present include: Aeronautical, African, Alexander Cozens (Art), Amnesty, Archeological, Architectural, Astronomy, Banks (conservation), Caledonian, Cheese, Classical, Comedy, Cosmopolitan, Debating, Design, Entrepreneurship, Geographical, Geopolitical, Henry Fielding, Hispanic, History, Keynes (economics), Law, Literary, Mathematical, Medical, Middle Eastern, Model United Nations, Modern Languages, Oriental, Orwell (left-wing), Simeon (Christian), Parry (music), Photographic, Political, Praed (poetry), Rock (music), Rous (equestrian), Salisbury (diplomatic), Savile (Rare Books and Manuscripts), Shelley, Scientific, Sports, Tech Club, Theatre, Wellington (military), Wine and Wotton\u2019s (philosophy).', u'Among past guest speakers are Andrew Lloyd Webber, J. K. Rowling, Vivienne Westwood, Ian McKellen, Kevin Warwick, Boris Johnson, Rowan Atkinson, Ralph Fiennes, Terry Wogan, King Constantine II of Greece, Katie Price, Zoe Wanamaker, Boris Berezovsky and Kit Hesketh-Harvey.', u'== Grants and prizes ==\nPrizes are awarded on the results of trials (internal exams), GCSE and AS-levels.', u'In addition, many subjects and activities have specially endowed prizes, several of which are awarded by visiting experts.', u'The most prestigious is the Newcastle Scholarship, awarded on the strength of an examination, consisting of two papers in philosophical theology, moral theory and applied ethics.', u'Also of note are the Gladstone Memorial Prize and the Coutts Prize, awarded on the results of trials and AS-level examinations in C; and the Huxley Prize, awarded for a project on a scientific subject.', u"Other specialist prizes include the Newcastle Classical Prize; the Rosebery Exhibition for History; the Queen's Prizes for French and German; the Duke of Newcastle's Russian Prize; the Beddington Spanish Prize; the Strafford and Bowman Shakespeare Prizes; the Tomline and Russell Prizes in Mathematics; the Sotheby Prize for History of Art; the Waddington Prize for Theology and Philosophy; the Birley Prize for History; The Lower Boy Rosebery Prize and the Wilder Prize for Theology.", u'Prizes are awarded too for excellence in such activities as painting, sculpture, ceramics, playing musical instruments, musical composition, declamation, silverwork, and design.', u'Various benefactions make it possible to give grants each year to boys who wish, for educational or cultural reasons, to work or travel abroad.', u'These include the Busk Fund, which supports individual ventures that show particular initiative; the C. M. Wells Memorial Trust Fund, for the promotion of visits to classical lands; the Sadler Fund, which supports, among others, those intending to enter the Foreign Service; and the Marsden Fund, for travel in countries where the principal language is not English.', u'== Incentives and sanctions ==\nEton has a well-established system for encouraging boys to produce high-standard work.', u'An excellent piece of work may be rewarded with a "Show Up", to be shown to the boy\'s tutors as evidence of progress.', u'If, in any particular term, a pupil makes a particularly good effort in any subject, he may be "Commended for Good Effort" to the Head Master (or Lower Master).', u'If any boy produces an outstanding piece of work, it may be "Sent Up For Good", storing the effort in the College Archives for posterity.', u'This award has been around since the 18th century.', u"As Sending Up For Good is fairly infrequent, the process is rather mysterious to many of Eton's boys.", u'First, the master wishing to Send Up For Good must gain the permission of the relevant Head of Department.', u'Upon receiving his or her approval, the piece of work will be marked with Sent Up For Good and the student will receive a card to be signed by House Master, tutor and division master.', u'The opposite of a Show Up is a "Rip".', u"This is for sub-standard work, which is sometimes torn at the top of the page/sheet and must be submitted to the boy's housemaster for signature.", u'Boys who accumulate rips are liable to be given a "White Ticket", which must be signed by all his teachers and may be accompanied by other punishments, usually involving doing domestic chores or writing lines.', u'In recent times, a milder form of the rip, \'sign for information\', colloquially known as an "info", has been introduced, which must also be signed by the boy\'s housemaster and tutor.', u'Internal examinations are held at the end of the Michaelmas term for all pupils, and in the Summer term for those in the first, second and fourth years.', u'These internal examinations are called "Trials".', u'A boy who is late for any division or other appointment may be required to sign "Tardy Book", a register kept in the School Office, between 7:35am and 7:45am, every morning for the duration of his sentence (typically three days).', u'Tardy Book may also be issued for late work.', u'For more serious misdeeds, a boy is summoned from his lessons to the Head Master, or Lower Master if the boy is in the lower two years, to talk personally about his misdeeds.', u'This is known as the "Bill".', u'The most serious misdeeds may result in expulsion, or rustication (suspension).', u'Conversely, should a master be more than 15 minutes late for a class, traditionally the pupils might claim it as a "run" and absent themselves for the rest of its duration.', u'A traditional form of punishment took the form of being made to copy, by hand, Latin hexameters.', u'Miscreants were frequently set 100 hexameters by Library members, or, for more serious offences, Georgics (more than 500 hexameters) by their House Masters or the Head Master.', u'The giving of a Georgic is now extremely rare, but still occasionally occurs.', u'=== Corporal punishment ===\nEton used to be renowned for its use of corporal punishment, generally known as "beating".', u'In the 16th century, Friday was set aside as "flogging day".', u'Beating was phased out in the 1980s.', u'The film director Sebastian Doggart claims to have been the last boy caned at Eton, in 1984.', u'Until 1964, offending boys could be summoned to the Head Master or the Lower Master, as appropriate, to receive a birching on the bare posterior, in a semi-public ceremony held in the Library, where there was a special wooden birching block over which the offender was held.', u'John Keate, Head Master from 1809 to 1834, took over at a time when discipline was poor.', u'Anthony Chenevix-Trench, Head Master from 1964 to 1970, abolished the birch and replaced it with caning, also applied to the bare posterior, which he administered privately in his office.', u'Chenevix-Trench also abolished corporal punishment administered by senior boys.', u'Previously, House Captains were permitted to cane miscreants over the seat of the trousers.', u'This was a routine occurrence, carried out privately with the boy bending over with his head under the edge of a table.', u'Less common but more severe were the canings administered by Pop (see Eton Society below) in the form of a "Pop-Tanning", in which a large number of hard strokes were inflicted by the President of Pop in the presence of all Pop members (or, in earlier times, each member of Pop took it in turns to inflict a stroke).', u'The culprit was summoned to appear in a pair of old trousers, as the caning would cut the cloth to shreds.', u'This was the most severe form of physical punishment at Eton.', u"Chenevix-Trench's successor from 1970, Michael McCrum, retained private corporal punishment by masters, but ended the practice of requiring boys to take their trousers and underwear down when bending over to be caned by the Head Master.", u'By the mid-1970s, the only people allowed to administer caning were the Head Master and the Lower Master.', u'== Prefects ==\nIn addition to the masters, the following three categories of senior boys are entitled to exercise School discipline.', u'Boys who belong to any of these categories, in addition to a limited number of other boy office holders, are entitled to wear winged collars with bow ties.', u'Eton Society: commonly known as Pop.', u'Over the years its power and privileges have grown.', u'Pop is the oldest self-electing society at Eton.', u'The rules were altered in 1987 and again in 2005 so that the new intake are not elected solely by the existing year and a committee of masters.', u'Members of Pop are entitled to wear checked spongebag trousers, and a waistcoat designed as they wish.', u'Historically, only members of Pop were entitled to furl their umbrellas or sit on the wall on the Long Walk, in front of the main building.', u'However, this tradition has died out.', u"They perform roles at many of the routine events of the school year, including School Plays, parents' evenings and other official events.", u'Notable ex-members of Pop include Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, Eddie Redmayne and Boris Johnson.', u"Sixth Form Select: an academically selected prefectorial group consisting, by custom, of the 10 senior King's Scholars and the 10 senior Oppidan Scholars.", u'Members of Sixth Form Select are entitled to wear silver buttons on their waistcoats.', u'They also act as Praepostors: they enter classrooms and ask, "Is (family name) in this division?"', u'followed by "He\'s to see the Head Master at (time)" (the Bill, see above).', u'Members of Sixth Form Select also perform "Speeches", a formal event held five times a year.', u"House Captains: The captains of each of the 25 boys' houses (see above) have disciplinary powers at school level.", u'House Captains are entitled to wear a mottled-grey waistcoat.', u'It is possible to belong to the Eton Society and Sixth Form Select at the same time.', u'In the era of Queen Elizabeth I there were two praepostors in every form, who noted down the names of absentees.', u'Until the late 19th century, there was a praepostor for every division of the school.', u'== Sports ==\nSport is a feature of Eton; there is an extensive network of playing fields.', u'Their names include Agar\'s Plough, Dutchman\'s, Upper Club, Lower Club, Sixpenny/The Field, and Mesopotamia (situated between two streams and often shortened to "Mespots").', u'During the Michaelmas Half, the sport curriculum is dominated by football (called Association) and rugby union, with some rowing for a smaller number of boys.', u'During the Lent Half it is dominated by the field game, a code of football, but this is unique to Eton and cannot be played against other schools.', u'During this half, Collegers also play the Eton wall game; this game received national publicity when it was taken up by Prince Harry.', u"Aided by AstroTurf facilities on Masters' field, field hockey has become a major Lent Half sport along with Rugby 7's.", u"Elite rowers prepare for the Schools' Head of the River Race in late March.", u'During the Summer Half, sporting boys divide into dry bobs, who play cricket, tennis or athletics, and wet bobs, who row on the River Thames and the rowing lake in preparation for The National Schools Regatta and the Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta.', u'The rowing lake at Dorney was developed and is owned by the College.', u'It was the venue for the rowing and canoeing events at the 2012 Summer Olympics and the World Junior Rowing Championships.', u"The annual cricket match against Harrow at Lord's Cricket Ground is the oldest fixture of the cricketing calendar, having been played there since 1805.", u"A staple of the London society calendar since the 1800s, in 1914, its importance was such that over 38,000 people attended the two days' play, and in 1910 the match made national headlines.", u'But interest has since declined considerably, and the match is now a one-day limited overs contest.', u'There is a running track at the Thames Valley Athletics Centre and an annual steeplechase.', u'Among the other sports played at Eton is Eton Fives.', u'In 1815, Eton College documented its football rules, the first football code to be written down anywhere in the world.', u'== Music and drama ==\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe current "Precentor" (Head of Music) is Tim Johnson, and the School boasts eight organs and an entire building for music (performance spaces include the School Hall, the Farrer Theatre and two halls dedicated to music, the Parry Hall and the Concert Hall).', u'Many instruments are taught, including obscure ones such as the didgeridoo.', u'The School participates in many national competitions; many pupils are part of the National Youth Orchestra, and the School gives scholarships for dedicated and talented musicians.', u'A former Precentor of the college, Ralph Allwood set up and organised Eton Choral Courses, which run at the School every summer.', u"In 2009, the School's musical prot\xe9g\xe9s came to wider notice when featured in a TV documentary A Boy Called Alex.", u'The film followed an Etonian, Alex Stobbs, a musician with cystic fibrosis, as he worked toward conducting the difficult Magnificat by Johann Sebastian Bach.', u'=== Drama ===\n\nNumerous plays are put on every year at Eton College; there is one main theatre, called the Farrer (seating 400) and 2 Studio theatres, called the Caccia Studio and Empty Space (seating 90 and 80 respectively).', u'There are about 8 or 9 house productions each year, around 3 or 4 "independent" plays (not confined solely to one house, produced, directed and funded by Etonians) and three school plays, one specifically for boys in the first two years, and two open to all years.', u'The School Plays have such good reputations that they are normally fully booked every night.', u'Productions also take place in varying locations around the School, varying from the sports fields to more historic buildings such as Upper School and College Chapel.', u"In recent years, the School has put on a musical version of The Bacchae (October 2009) as well as productions of A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (May 2010), The Cherry Orchard (February 2011), Joseph K (October 2011), Cyrano de Bergerac (May 2012), Macbeth (October 2012), London Assurance (May 2013), Jerusalem (October 2013), and A Midsummer Night's Dream (May 2014).", u"Often girls from surrounding schools, such as St George's, Ascot, St Mary's School Ascot, Windsor Girls' School and Heathfield St Mary's School, are cast in female roles.", u'Boys from the School are also responsible for the lighting, sound and stage management of all the productions, under the guidance of several professional full-time theatre staff.', u"Every year, Eton employs a 'Director-in-Residence', an external professional director on a one-year contract who normally directs one house play and the Lower Boy play (a school play open solely to the first two-year groups), as well as teaching Drama and Theatre Studies to most year groups.", u'The drama department is headed by Hailz-Emily Osborne and several other teachers; Simon Dormandy was on the staff until late 2012.', u'The School offers GCSE drama as well as A-level "English with Theatre Studies."', u'== Celebrations ==\nEton\'s best-known holiday takes place on the so-called "Fourth of June", a celebration of the birthday of King George III, Eton\'s greatest patron.', u'This day is celebrated with the Procession of Boats, in which the top rowing crews from the top four years row past in vintage wooden rowing boats.', u'Similar to the Queen\'s Official Birthday, the "Fourth of June" is no longer celebrated on 4 June, but on the Wednesday before the first weekend of June.', u"Eton also observes St. Andrew's Day, on which the Eton wall game is played.", u'== School magazines ==\nThe Junior Chronicle and The Chronicle are the official School magazines, the latter having been founded in 1863.', u'Both are edited by boys at the School.', u'Although liable to censorship, the latter has a tradition of satirising and attacking School policies, as well as documenting recent events.', u'The Oppidan, founded in 1828, was published once a Half; it covered all sport in Eton and some professional events as well, but no longer exists.', u'Other School magazines, including The Spectrum (the Academic Yearbook), The Arts Review, and The Eton Zeitgeist have been published, as well as publications produced by individual departments such as The Cave (Philosophy), Etonomics (Economics), Scientific Etonian (Science), Timeline (History), Praed (Poetry and Song), The Mayflower (English), and The Lexicon (Modern Languages).', u'== Charitable status and fees ==\nUntil 18 December 2010, Eton College was an exempt charity under English law (Charities Act 1993, Schedule 2).', u'Under the provisions of the Charities Act 2006, it is now an excepted charity, and fully registered with the Charities Commission, and is now one of the 100 largest charities in the UK.', u'As a charity, it benefits from substantial tax breaks.', u'It was calculated by the late David Jewell, former Master of Haileybury, that in 1992 such tax breaks saved the School about \xa31,945 per pupil per year, although he had no direct connection with the School.', u'This subsidy has declined since the 2001 abolition by the Labour Government of state-funded scholarships (formerly known as "assisted places") to independent schools.', u'However, no child attended Eton on this scheme, meaning that the actual level of state assistance to the School has always been lower.', u"Eton's retiring Head Master, Tony Little, has claimed that the benefits that Eton provides to the local community free of charge (use of its facilities, etc.)", u'have a higher value than the tax breaks it receives as a result of its charitable status.', u'The fee for the academic year 2010\u20132011 was \xa329,862 (approximately US$48,600 or \u20ac35,100 as of March 2011), although the sum is considerably lower for those pupils on bursaries and scholarships.', u"== Controversy ==\n\n\n=== Lottery grant (1995) ===\nIn 1995 the National Lottery granted money for a \xa34.6m sports complex, to add to Eton's existing facilities of two swimming pools, 30 cricket squares, 24 football, rugby and hockey pitches and a gym.", u'The College paid \xa3200,000 and contributed 4.5 hectares of land in return for exclusive use of the facilities during the daytime only.', u'The UK Sports Council defended the deal on the grounds that the whole community would benefit, while the bursar claimed that Windsor, Slough and Eton Athletic Club was "deprived" because local people (who were not pupils at the College) did not have a world-class running track and facilities to train with.', u'Steve Osborn, director of the Safe Neighbourhoods Unit, described the decision as "staggering" given the background of a substantial reduction in youth services by councils across the country, a matter over which, however, neither the College nor the UK Sports Council, had any control.', u'The facility, which became the Thames Valley Athletics Centre, opened in April 1999.', u'=== Unfair dismissal of an art teacher (2004) ===\nIn October 2004, Sarah Forsyth claimed that she had been dismissed unfairly by Eton College and had been bullied by senior staff.', u"She also claimed she was instructed to do some of Prince Harry's coursework to enable him to pass AS Art.", u'As evidence, Forsyth provided secretly recorded conversations with both Prince Harry and her Head of Department, Ian Burke.', u'An employment tribunal in July 2005 found that she had been unfairly dismissed and criticised Burke for bullying her and for repeatedly changing his story.', u'It also criticised the school for failing to produce its capability procedures and criticised the Head Master for not reviewing the case independently.', u'It criticised Forsyth\'s decision to record a conversation with Harry as an abuse of teacher\u2013student confidentiality and said "It is clear whichever version of the evidence is accepted that Mr Burke did ask the claimant to assist Prince Harry with text for his expressive art project.', u'...', u'It is not part of this tribunal\'s function to determine whether or not it was legitimate."', u'In response to the tribunal\'s ruling concerning the allegations about Prince Harry, the School issued a statement, saying Forsyth\'s claims "were dismissed for what they always have been\u2014unfounded and irrelevant."', u'A spokesperson from Clarence House said, "We are delighted that Harry has been totally cleared of cheating."', u'=== School fees cartel (2005) ===\n\nIn 2005, the Office of Fair Trading found fifty independent schools, including Eton, to have breached the Competition Act by "regularly and systematically" exchanging information about planned increases in school fees, which was collated and distributed among the schools by the bursar at Sevenoaks School.', u'Following the investigation by the OFT, each school was required to pay around \xa370,000, totalling around \xa33.5 million, significantly less than the maximum possible fine.', u'In addition, the schools together agreed to contribute another \xa33m to a new charitable educational fund.', u'The incident raised concerns over whether the charitable status of independent schools such as Eton should be reconsidered, and perhaps revoked.', u'However, Jean Scott, the head of the Independent Schools Council, said the schools were following a long-established procedure in sharing the information with each other because independent schools were previously exempt from anti-cartel rules applied to business and that they were unaware of the change to the law (on which they had not been consulted).', u'She wrote to John Vickers, the OFT director-general, saying, "They are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer.', u'They are schools that have quite openly continued to follow a long-established practice because they were unaware that the law had changed."', u'=== Farming subsidies (2005) ===\nA Freedom of Information request in 2005 revealed that Eton had received \xa32,652 in farming subsidies in 2004 under the Common Agricultural Policy.', u"Asked to explain under what grounds it was eligible to receive farming subsidies, Eton admitted that it was 'a bit of a mystery'.", u"Panorama revealed in March 2012 that farming subsidies were granted to Eton for 'environmental improvements', in effect 'being paid without having to do any farming at all'.", u"=== University admissions (2010, 2011) ===\nFigures obtained by The Daily Telegraph had revealed that, in 2010, 37 applicants from Eton were accepted by Oxford whilst state schools had difficulty obtaining entry even for pupils with the country's most impressive exam results.", u'According to The Economist, Oxford and Cambridge admit more Etonians each year than applicants from the whole country who qualify for free school meals.', u"In April 2011 the Labour MP David Lammy described as unfair and 'indefensible' the fact that Oxford University had organised nine 'outreach events' at Eton in 2010, although he admitted that it had, in fact, held fewer such events for Eton than for another independent school, Wellington College.", u'=== Scholarship exam question about killing protesters (2011) ===\nIn May 2013, Eton College was criticised in several editorials for asking potential 2011 scholarship students how, if they were Prime Minister, they might defend the use of lethal force by the Army after two days of violent protests in which several policemen have been killed.', u'=== Mistaken acceptance emails (2015) ===\nIn July 2015, Eton accidentally sent emails to 400 prospective students, offering them conditional entrance to the school in September 2017.', u"The email was intended for nine students, but an IT glitch caused the email to be sent to 400 additional families, who didn't necessarily have a place.", u'In response, the school issued the following statement: "This error was discovered within minutes and each family was immediately contacted to notify them that it should be disregarded and to apologise.', u'We take this type of incident very seriously indeed and so a thorough investigation, overseen by the headmaster Tony Little and led by the tutor for admissions, is being carried out to find out exactly what went wrong and ensure it cannot happen again.', u'Eton College offers its sincere apologies to those boys concerned and their families.', u'We deeply regret the confusion and upset this must have caused."', u'== Historical relations with other schools ==\nEton College has links with some private schools in India today, maintained from the days of the British Raj, such as The Doon School and Mayo College.', u"Eton College is also a member of the G20 Schools Group, a collection of college preparatory boarding schools from around the world, including Turkey's Robert College, the United States' Phillips Academy and Phillips Exeter Academy, Australia's Scotch College, Melbourne Grammar School and Launceston Church Grammar School, Singapore's Raffles Institution, and Switzerland's International School of Geneva.", u'Eton has recently fostered a relationship with the Roxbury Latin School, a traditional all-boys private school in Boston, US.', u'Former Eton headmaster and provost Sir Eric Anderson shares a close friendship with Roxbury Latin Headmaster emeritus F. Washington Jarvis; Anderson has visited Roxbury Latin on numerous occasions, while Jarvis briefly taught theology at Eton after retiring from his headmaster post at Roxbury Latin.', u"The headmasters' close friendship spawned the Hennessy Scholarship, an annual prize established in 2005 and awarded to a graduating RL senior for a year of study at Eton.", u'Hennessy Scholars generally reside in Wotton house.', u"=== The Doon School, India ===\nThe Doon School, founded in 1935, was the first all-boys' public school in India modelled along the lines of Eton.", u"The School's first headmaster was an Englishman, Arthur E.

Edgar Hoover as director ===\n\nJ. Edgar Hoover served as Director from 1924 to 1972, a combined 48 years with the BOI, DOI, and FBI.', u'He was chiefly responsible for creating the Scientific Crime Detection Laboratory, or the FBI Laboratory, which officially opened in 1932, as part of his work to professionalize investigations by the government.', u'Hoover was substantially involved in most major cases and projects that the FBI handled during his tenure.', u"After Hoover's death, Congress passed legislation that limited the tenure of future FBI Directors to ten years.", u'During the "War on Crime" of the 1930s, FBI agents apprehended or killed a number of notorious criminals who carried out kidnappings, robberies, and murders throughout the nation, including John Dillinger, "Baby Face" Nelson, Kate "Ma" Barker, Alvin "Creepy" Karpis, and George "Machine Gun" Kelly.', u'Other activities of its early decades included a decisive role in reducing the scope and influence of the Ku Klux Klan.', u'Additionally, through the work of Edwin Atherton, the FBI claimed success in apprehending an entire army of Mexican neo-revolutionaries along the California border in the 1920s.', u'Hoover began using wiretapping in the 1920s during Prohibition to arrest bootleggers.', u"In the 1927 case Olmstead v. United States, in which a bootlegger was caught through telephone tapping, the United States Supreme Court ruled that FBI wiretaps did not violate the Fourth Amendment as unlawful search and seizure, as long as the FBI did not break into a person's home to complete the tapping.", u"After Prohibition's repeal, Congress passed the Communications Act of 1934, which outlawed non-consensual phone tapping, but allowed bugging.", u'In the 1939 case Nardone v. United States, the court ruled that due to the 1934 law, evidence the FBI obtained by phone tapping was inadmissible in court.', u'After the 1967 case Katz v. United States overturned the 1927 case that had allowed bugging, Congress passed the Omnibus Crime Control Act, allowing public authorities to tap telephones during investigations as long as they obtain a warrant beforehand.', u'==== National security ====\nBeginning in the 1940s and continuing into the 1970s, the bureau investigated cases of espionage against the United States and its allies.', u'Eight Nazi agents who had planned sabotage operations against American targets were arrested, and six were executed (Ex parte Quirin) under their sentences.', u'Also during this time, a joint US/UK code-breaking effort (the Venona project)\u2014with which the FBI was heavily involved\u2014broke Soviet diplomatic and intelligence communications codes, allowing the US and British governments to read Soviet communications.', u'This effort confirmed the existence of Americans working in the United States for Soviet intelligence.', u'Hoover was administering this project but failed to notify the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) until 1952.', u'Another notable case is the arrest of Soviet spy Rudolf Abel in 1957.', u'The discovery of Soviet spies operating in the US allowed Hoover to pursue his longstanding obsession with the threat he perceived from the American Left, ranging from Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA) union organizers to American liberals.', u'==== Japanese American internment ====\nIn 1939, the Bureau began compiling a custodial detention list with the names of those who would be taken into custody in the event of war with Axis nations.', u'The majority of the names on the list belonged to Issei community leaders, as the FBI investigation built on an existing Naval Intelligence index that had focused on Japanese Americans in Hawaii and the West Coast, but many German and Italian nationals also found their way onto the secret list.', u'Robert Shivers, head of the Honolulu office, obtained permission from Hoover to start detaining those on the list on December 7, 1941, while bombs were still falling over Pearl Harbor.', u'Mass arrests and searches of homes (in most cases conducted without warrants) began a few hours after the attack, and over the next several weeks more than 5,500 Issei men were taken into FBI custody.', u'On February 19, 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, authorizing the removal of Japanese Americans from the West Coast.', u'FBI Director Hoover opposed the subsequent mass removal and confinement of Japanese Americans authorized under Executive Order 9066, but Roosevelt prevailed.', u'The vast majority went along with the subsequent exclusion orders, but in a handful of cases where Japanese Americans refused to obey the new military regulations, FBI agents handled their arrests.', u'The Bureau continued surveillance on Japanese Americans throughout the war, conducting background checks on applicants for resettlement outside camp, and entering the camps (usually without the permission of War Relocation Authority officials) and grooming informants in order to monitor dissidents and "troublemakers."', u'After the war, the FBI was assigned to protect returning Japanese Americans from attacks by hostile white communities.', u'==== Civil Rights Movement ====\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, FBI officials became increasingly concerned about the influence of civil rights leaders, whom they believed had communist ties or were unduly influenced by them.', u'In 1956, for example, Hoover sent an open letter denouncing Dr. T.R.M.', u'Howard, a civil rights leader, surgeon, and wealthy entrepreneur in Mississippi who had criticized FBI inaction in solving recent murders of George W. Lee, Emmett Till, and other blacks in the South.', u'The FBI carried out controversial domestic surveillance in an operation it called the COINTELPRO, a portmanteau derived from "COunter-INTELligence PROgram."', u'It was to investigate and disrupt the activities of dissident political organizations within the United States, including both militant and non-violent organizations.', u'Among its targets was the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, a leading civil rights organization with clergy leadership.', u'The FBI frequently investigated Martin Luther King, Jr.', u'In the mid-1960s, King began publicly criticizing the Bureau for giving insufficient attention to the use of terrorism by white supremacists.', u'Hoover responded by publicly calling King the most "notorious liar" in the United States.', u'In his 1991 memoir, Washington Post journalist Carl Rowan asserted that the FBI had sent at least one anonymous letter to King encouraging him to commit suicide.', u'Historian Taylor Branch documents an anonymous November 1964 "suicide package" sent by the Bureau that combined a letter to the civil rights leader telling him "You are done.', u'There is only one way out for you..." with audio recordings of King\'s sexual indiscretions.', u"In March 1971, the residential office of an FBI agent in Media, Pennsylvania was burglarized by a group calling itself the Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI.", u'Numerous files were taken and distributed to a range of newspapers, including The Harvard Crimson.', u"The files detailed the FBI's extensive COINTELPRO program, which included investigations into lives of ordinary citizens\u2014including a black student group at a Pennsylvania military college and the daughter of Congressman Henry Reuss of Wisconsin.", u'The country was "jolted" by the revelations, which included assassinations of political activists, and the actions were denounced by members of Congress, including House Majority Leader Hale Boggs.', u'The phones of some members of Congress, including Boggs, had allegedly been tapped.', u"==== Kennedy's assassination ====\nWhen President John F. Kennedy was shot and killed, the jurisdiction fell to the local police departments until President Lyndon B. Johnson directed the FBI to take over the investigation.", u'To ensure clarity about responsibility for investigation of homicides of federal officials, Congress passed a law that put investigations of deaths of federal officials within FBI jurisdiction.', u'This new law was passed in 1965.', u'=== Organized crime ===\nIn response to organized crime, on August 25, 1953, the FBI created the Top Hoodlum Program.', u'The national office directed field offices to gather information on mobsters in their territories and to report it regularly to Washington for a centralized collection of intelligence on racketeers.', u'After the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO Act, took effect, the FBI began investigating the former Prohibition-organized groups, which had become fronts for crime in major cities and small towns.', u'All of the FBI work was done undercover and from within these organizations, using the provisions provided in the RICO Act.', u'Gradually the agency dismantled many of the groups.', u'Although Hoover initially denied the existence of a National Crime Syndicate in the United States, the Bureau later conducted operations against known organized crime syndicates and families, including those headed by Sam Giancana and John Gotti.', u'The RICO Act is still used today for all organized crime and any individuals who might fall under the Act.', u'In 2003 a congressional committee called the FBI\'s organized crime informant program "one of the greatest failures in the history of federal law enforcement."', u'The FBI allowed four innocent men to be convicted of the March 1965 gangland murder of Edward "Teddy" Deegan in order to protect Vincent Flemmi, an FBI informant.', u'Three of the men were sentenced to death (which was later reduced to life in prison), and the fourth defendant was sentenced to life in prison.', u'Two of the four men died in prison after serving almost 30 years, and two others were released after serving 32 and 36 years.', u'In July 2007, U.S. District Judge Nancy Gertner in Boston found the bureau helped convict the four men using false witness account by mobster Joseph Barboza.', u'The U.S. Government was ordered to pay $100 million in damages to the four defendants.', u'=== Special FBI teams ===\n\nIn 1982, the FBI formed an elite unit to help with problems that might arise at the 1984 Summer Olympics to be held in Los Angeles, particularly terrorism and major-crime.', u'This was a result of the 1972 Summer Olympics at Munich, Germany, when terrorists murdered the Israeli athletes.', u'Named Hostage Rescue Team (HRT), it acts as the FBI lead for a national SWAT team in related procedures and all counter-terrorism cases.', u'Also formed in 1984 was the Computer Analysis and Response Team (CART).', u'From the end of the 1980s to the early 1990s, the FBI reassigned more than 300 agents from foreign counter-intelligence duties to violent crime, and made violent crime the sixth national priority.', u'With reduced cuts to other well-established departments, and because terrorism was no longer considered a threat after the end of the Cold War, the FBI assisted local and state police forces in tracking fugitives who had crossed state lines, which is a federal offense.', u'The FBI Laboratory helped develop DNA testing, continuing its pioneering role in identification that began with its fingerprinting system in 1924.', u'=== Notable efforts in the 1990s ===\n\nBetween 1993 and 1996, the FBI increased its counter-terrorism role in the wake of the first 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York City, New York; the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and the arrest of the Unabomber in 1996.', u'Technological innovation and the skills of FBI Laboratory analysts helped ensure that the three cases were successfully prosecuted.', u"Justice Department investigations into the FBI's roles in the Ruby Ridge and Waco incidents were found to be obstructed by agents within the Bureau.", u'During the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, the FBI was criticized for its investigation of the Centennial Olympic Park bombing.', u'It has settled a dispute with Richard Jewell, who was a private security guard at the venue, along with some media organizations, in regard to the leaking of his name during the investigation.', u'After Congress passed the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA, 1994), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA, 1996), and the Economic Espionage Act (EEA, 1996), the FBI followed suit and underwent a technological upgrade in 1998, just as it did with its CART team in 1991.', u'Computer Investigations and Infrastructure Threat Assessment Center (CITAC) and the National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) were created to deal with the increase in Internet-related problems, such as computer viruses, worms, and other malicious programs that threatened US operations.', u'With these developments, the FBI increased its electronic surveillance in public safety and national security investigations, adapting to the telecommunications advancements that changed the nature of such problems.', u'=== September 11 attacks ===\nDuring the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center, FBI agent Leonard W. Hatton Jr. was killed during the rescue effort while helping the rescue personnel evacuate the occupants of the South Tower and stayed when it collapsed.', u'Within months after the attacks, FBI Director Robert Mueller, who had been sworn in a week before the attacks, called for a re-engineering of FBI structure and operations.', u'He made countering every federal crime a top priority, including the prevention of terrorism, countering foreign intelligence operations, addressing cyber security threats, other high-tech crimes, protecting civil rights, combating public corruption, organized crime, white-collar crime, and major acts of violent crime.', u'In February 2001, Robert Hanssen was caught selling information to the Russian government.', u'It was later learned that Hanssen, who had reached a high position within the FBI, had been selling intelligence since as early as 1979.', u'He pleaded guilty to treason and received a life sentence in 2002, but the incident led many to question the security practices employed by the FBI.', u'There was also a claim that Robert Hanssen might have contributed information that led to the September 11, 2001, attacks.', u"The 9/11 Commission's final report on July 22, 2004, stated that the FBI and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) were both partially to blame for not pursuing intelligence reports that could have prevented the September 11, 2001, attacks.", u'In its most damning assessment, the report concluded that the country had "not been well served" by either agency and listed numerous recommendations for changes within the FBI.', u'While the FBI has acceded to most of the recommendations, including oversight by the new Director of National Intelligence, some former members of the 9/11 Commission publicly criticized the FBI in October 2005, claiming it was resisting any meaningful changes.', u"On July 8, 2007, The Washington Post published excerpts from UCLA Professor Amy Zegart's book Spying Blind: The CIA, the FBI, and the Origins of 9/11.", u"The Post reported from Zegart's book that government documents show the CIA and FBI missed 23 potential chances to disrupt the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.", u'The primary reasons for the failures included: agency cultures resistant to change and new ideas; inappropriate incentives for promotion; and a lack of cooperation between the FBI, CIA and the rest of the United States Intelligence Community.', u"The book blamed the FBI's decentralized structure, which prevented effective communication and cooperation among different FBI offices.", u'The book suggested that the FBI has not evolved into an effective counter-terrorism or counter-intelligence agency, due in large part to deeply ingrained agency cultural resistance to change.', u"For example, FBI personnel practices continue to treat all staff other than special agents as support staff, classifying intelligence analysts alongside the FBI's auto mechanics and janitors.", u'=== Faulty bullet analysis ===\nFor over 40 years, the FBI crime lab in Quantico believed lead in bullets had unique chemical signatures.', u'It analyzed the bullets with the goal of matching them chemically, not only to a single batch of ammunition coming out of a factory, but also to a single box of bullets.', u'The National Academy of Sciences conducted an 18-month independent review of comparative bullet-lead analysis.', u'In 2003, its National Research Council published a report whose conclusions called into question 30 years of FBI testimony.', u'It found the analytic model used by the FBI for interpreting results was deeply flawed, and the conclusion, that bullet fragments could be matched to a box of ammunition, was so overstated that it was misleading under the rules of evidence.', u'One year later, the FBI decided to stop doing bullet lead analysis.', u'After a 60 Minutes/Washington Post investigation in November 2007 (two years later), the bureau agreed to identify, review, and release all pertinent cases, and notify prosecutors about cases in which faulty testimony was given.', u'== Organization ==\n\n\n=== Organizational structure ===\n\nThe FBI is organized into functional branches and the Office of the Director, which contains most administrative offices.', u'An executive assistant director manages each branch.', u'Each branch is then divided into offices and divisions, each headed by an assistant director.', u'The various divisions are further divided into sub-branches, led by deputy assistant directors.', u'Within these sub-branches there are various sections headed by section chiefs.', u'Section chiefs are ranked analogous to special agents in charge.', u'Four of the branches report to the deputy director while two report to the associate director.', u'The functions branches of the FBI are:\nFBI Intelligence Branch\nFBI National Security Branch\nFBI Criminal, Cyber, Response, and Services Branch\nFBI Science and Technology Branch\nFBI Information and Technology Branch\nFBI Human Resources Branch\nThe Office of the Director serves as the central administrative organ of the FBI.', u'The office provide staff support functions (such as finance and facilities management) to the five function branches and the various field divisions.', u'The office is managed by the FBI associate director, who also oversees the operations of both the Information and Technology and Human Resources Branches.', u'Office of the Director\nImmediate Office of the Director\nOffice of the Deputy Director\nOffice of the Associate

authority ==\n\nThe FBI\'s mandate is established in Title 28 of the United States Code (U.S. Code), Section 533, which authorizes the Attorney General to "appoint officials to detect and prosecute crimes against the United States."', u'Other federal statutes give the FBI the authority and responsibility to investigate specific crimes.', u"The FBI's chief tool against organized crime is the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act.", u'The FBI is also charged with the responsibility of enforcing compliance of the United States Civil Rights Act of 1964 and investigating violations of the act in addition to prosecuting such violations with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ).', u'The FBI also shares concurrent jurisdiction with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in the enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.', u'The USA PATRIOT Act increased the powers allotted to the FBI, especially in wiretapping and monitoring of Internet activity.', u'One of the most controversial provisions of the act is the so-called sneak and peek provision, granting the FBI powers to search a house while the residents are away, and not requiring them to notify the residents for several weeks afterwards.', u"Under the PATRIOT Act's provisions, the FBI also resumed inquiring into the library records of those who are suspected of terrorism (something it had supposedly not done since the 1970s).", u'In the early 1980s, Senate hearings were held to examine FBI undercover operations in the wake of the Abscam controversy, which had allegations of entrapment of elected officials.', u'As a result, in following years a number of guidelines were issued to constrain FBI activities.', u'A March 2007 report by the inspector general of the Justice Department described the FBI\'s "widespread and serious misuse" of national security letters, a form of administrative subpoena used to demand records and data pertaining to individuals.', u'The report said that between 2003 and 2005, the FBI had issued more than 140,000 national security letters, many involving people with no obvious connections to terrorism.', u'Information obtained through an FBI investigation is presented to the appropriate U.S. Attorney or Department of Justice official, who decides if prosecution or other action is warranted.', u'The FBI often works in conjunction with other Federal agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in seaport and airport security, and the National Transportation Safety Board in investigating airplane crashes and other critical incidents.', u'Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations (ICE-HSI) has nearly the same amount of investigative manpower as the FBI, and investigates the largest range of crimes.', u'In the wake of the September 11 attacks, then-Attorney General Ashcroft assigned the FBI as the designated lead organization in terrorism investigations after the creation of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.', u'ICE-HSI and the FBI are both integral members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force.', u'=== Indian reservations ===\nThe federal government has the primary responsibility for investigating and prosecuting serious crime on Indian reservations.', u'The FBI does not specifically list crimes in Native American land as one of its priorities.', u'Often serious crimes have been either poorly investigated or prosecution has been declined.', u'Tribal courts can impose sentences of up to three years, under certain restrictions.', u'== Infrastructure ==\n\nThe FBI is headquartered at the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington, D.C., with 56 field offices in major cities across the United States.', u'The FBI also maintains over 400 resident agencies across the United States, as well as over 50 legal attach\xe9s at United States embassies and consulates.', u'Many specialized FBI functions are located at facilities in Quantico, Virginia, as well as a "data campus" in Clarksburg, West Virginia, where 96 million sets of fingerprints "from across the United States are stored, along with others collected by American authorities from prisoners in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, Iraq and Afghanistan."', u'The FBI is in process of moving its Records Management Division, which processes Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, to Winchester, Virginia.', u'According to The Washington Post, the FBI "is building a vast repository controlled by people who work in a top-secret vault on the fourth floor of the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington.', u'This one stores the profiles of tens of thousands of Americans and legal residents who are not accused of any crime.', u'What they have done is appear to be acting suspiciously to a town sheriff, a traffic cop or even a neighbor."', u'The FBI Laboratory, established with the formation of the BOI, did not appear in the J. Edgar Hoover Building until its completion in 1974.', u'The lab serves as the primary lab for most DNA, biological, and physical work.', u'Public tours of FBI headquarters ran through the FBI laboratory workspace before the move to the J. Edgar Hoover Building.', u'The services the lab conducts include Chemistry, Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), Computer Analysis and Response, DNA Analysis, Evidence Response, Explosives, Firearms and Tool marks, Forensic Audio, Forensic Video, Image Analysis, Forensic Science Research, Forensic Science Training, Hazardous Materials Response, Investigative and Prospective Graphics, Latent Prints, Materials Analysis, Questioned Documents, Racketeering Records, Special Photographic Analysis, Structural Design, and Trace Evidence.', u'The services of the FBI Laboratory are used by many state, local, and international agencies free of charge.', u'The lab also maintains a second lab at the FBI Academy.', u'The FBI Academy, located in Quantico, Virginia, is home to the communications and computer laboratory the FBI utilizes.', u'It is also where new agents are sent for training to become FBI Special Agents.', u'Going through the 21-week course is required for every Special Agent.', u'First opened for use in 1972, the facility located on 385 acres (1.6 km2) of woodland.', u'The Academy trains state and local law enforcement agencies, which are invited to the law enforcement training center.', u'The FBI units that reside at Quantico are the Field and Police Training Unit, Firearms Training Unit, Forensic Science Research and Training Center, Technology Services Unit (TSU), Investigative Training Unit, Law Enforcement Communication Unit, Leadership and Management Science Units (LSMU), Physical Training Unit, New Agents\' Training Unit (NATU), Practical Applications Unit (PAU), the Investigative Computer Training Unit and the "College of Analytical Studies."', u'In 2000, the FBI began the Trilogy project to upgrade its outdated information technology (IT) infrastructure.', u'This project, originally scheduled to take three years and cost around $380 million, ended up going far over budget and behind schedule.', u'Efforts to deploy modern computers and networking equipment were generally successful, but attempts to develop new investigation software, outsourced to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), were not.', u'Virtual Case File, or VCF, as the software was known, was plagued by poorly defined goals, and repeated changes in management.', u'In January 2005, more than two years after the software was originally planned for completion, the FBI officially abandoned the project.', u'At least $100 million (and much more by some estimates) was spent on the project, which never became operational.', u'The FBI has been forced to continue using its decade-old Automated Case Support system, which IT experts consider woefully inadequate.', u'In March 2005, the FBI announced it was beginning a new, more ambitious software project, code-named Sentinel, which they expected to complete by 2009.', u'Carnivore was an electronic eavesdropping software system implemented by the FBI during the Clinton administration; it was designed to monitor email and electronic communications.', u'After prolonged negative coverage in the press, the FBI changed the name of its system from "Carnivore" to "DCS1000."', u'DCS is reported to stand for "Digital Collection System"; the system has the same functions as before.', u'The Associated Press reported in mid-January 2005 that the FBI essentially abandoned the use of Carnivore in 2001, in favor of commercially available software, such as NarusInsight.', u'The Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division, is located in Clarksburg, West Virginia.', u'Organized beginning in 1991, the office opened in 1995 as the youngest agency division.', u'The complex is the length of three football fields.', u'It provides a main repository for information in various data systems.', u'Under the roof of the CJIS are the programs for the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR), Fingerprint Identification, Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), NCIC 2000, and the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS).', u'Many state and local agencies use these data systems as a source for their own investigations and contribute to the database using secure communications.', u'FBI provides these tools of sophisticated identification and information services to local, state, federal, and international law enforcement agencies.', u'FBI is in charge of National Virtual Translation Center, which provides "timely and accurate translations of foreign intelligence for all elements of the Intelligence Community."', u'== Personnel ==\n\nAs of December 31, 2009, the FBI had a total of 33,852 employees.', u'That includes 13,412 special agents and 20,420 support professionals, such as intelligence analysts, language specialists, scientists, information technology specialists, and other professionals.', u'The Officer Down Memorial Page provides the biographies of 58 FBI agents killed in the line of duty from 1925 to 2011.', u'=== Hiring process ===\nThe FBI is near-impenetrable, with applicants intensely scrutinized and assessed over an extended period.', u'To apply to become an FBI agent, one must be between the ages of 23 and 37.', u'Due to the decision in Robert P. Isabella v. Department of State and Office of Personnel Management, 2008 M.S.P.B.', u'146, preference-eligible veterans may apply after age 37.', u'In 2009, the Office of Personnel Management issued implementation guidance on the Isabella decision.', u"The applicant must also hold American citizenship, be of high moral character, have a clean record, and hold at least a four-year bachelor's degree.", u'At least three years of professional work experience prior to application is also required.', u'All FBI employees require a Top Secret (TS) security clearance, and in many instances, employees need a TS/SCI (Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information) clearance.', u'To obtain a security clearance, all potential FBI personnel must pass a series of Single Scope Background Investigations (SSBI), which are conducted by the Office of Personnel Management.', u'Special Agents candidates also have to pass a Physical Fitness Test (PFT), which includes a 300-meter run, one-minute sit-ups, maximum push-ups, and a 1.5-mile (2.4 km) run.', u'Personnel must pass a polygraph test with questions including possible drug use.', u'Applicants who fail polygraphs may not gain employment with the FBI.', u'=== BOI and FBI directors ===\n\nFBI Directors are appointed by the President of the United States.', u'They must be confirmed by the United States Senate and serve a term of office of five years, with a maximum of ten years, if reappointed, unless they resign or are fired by the President before their term ends.', u'J. Edgar Hoover, appointed by Calvin Coolidge in 1924, was by far the longest-serving director, serving until his death in 1972.', u'In 1968, Congress passed legislation as part of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act Pub.L.', u'90\u2013351, June 19, 1968, 82 Stat.', u'197 that specified a 10-year limit, a maximum of two 5-year terms, for future FBI Directors, as well as requiring Senate confirmation of appointees.', u'As the incumbent, this legislation did not apply to Hoover, only to his successors.', u'The current FBI Director is James B. Comey, who was appointed in 2013 by Barack Obama.', u'The FBI director is responsible for the day-to-day operations at the FBI.', u'Along with his deputies, the director makes sure cases and operations are handled correctly.', u'The director also is in charge of making sure the leadership in any one of the FBI field offices is manned with qualified agents.', u'Before the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act was passed in the wake of the September 11 attacks, the FBI director would directly brief the President of the United States on any issues that arise from within the FBI.', u'Since then, the director now reports to the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), who in turn reports to the President.', u'== Weapons ==\n\nAn FBI special agent is issued a Glock Model 22 pistol or a Glock 23 in .40 S&W caliber.', u'If they fail their first qualification, they are issued either a Glock 17 or Glock 19, to aid in their next qualification.', u'In May 1997, the FBI officially adopted the Glock .40 S&W pistol for general agent use and first issued it to New Agent Class 98-1 in October 1997.', u'At present, the Model 23 "FG&R" (finger groove and rail) is the issue sidearm.', u'New agents are issued firearms, on which they must qualify, on successful completion of their training at the FBI Academy.', u'The Glock 26 in 9\xd719mm Parabellum, and Glock Models 23 and 27 in .40 S&W caliber are authorized as secondary weapons.', u'Special agents are authorized to purchase and qualify with the Glock Model 21 in .45 ACP.', u'Special agents of the FBI HRT (Hostage Rescue Team), and regional SWAT teams are issued the Springfield Professional Model 1911A1 .45 ACP pistol (see FBI Special Weapons and Tactics Teams).', u'== Publications ==\nThe FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin is published monthly by the FBI Law Enforcement Communication Unit, with articles of interest to state and local law enforcement personnel.', u'First published in 1932 as Fugitives Wanted by Police, the FBI Law Bulletin covers topics including law enforcement technology and issues, such as crime mapping and use of force, as well as recent criminal justice research, and Vi-CAP alerts, on wanted suspects and key cases.', u'The FBI also publishes some reports for both law enforcement personnel as well as regular citizens covering topics including law enforcement, terrorism, cybercrime, white-collar crime, violent crime, and statistics.', u'However, the vast majority of federal government publications covering these topics are published by the Office of Justice Programs agencies of the United States Department of Justice, and disseminated through the National Criminal Justice Reference Service.', u'=== Crime statistics ===\nIn the 1920s, the FBI began issuing crime reports by gathering numbers from local police departments.', u'Due to limitations of this system found during the 1960s and 1970s\u2014victims often simply did not report crimes to the police in the first place\u2014the Department of Justice developed an alternate method of tallying crime, the victimization survey.', u'==== Uniform Crime Reports ====\n\nThe Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) compile data from over 17,000 law enforcement agencies across the country.', u'They provide detailed data regarding the volume of crimes to include arrest, clearance (or closing a case), and law enforcement officer information.', u'The UCR focuses its data collection on violent crimes, hate crimes, and property crimes.', u'Created in the 1920s, the UCR system has not proven to be as uniform as its name implies.', u'The UCR data only reflect the most serious offense in the case of connected crimes and has a very restrictive definition of rape.', u'Since about 93% of the data submitted to the FBI is in this format, the UCR stands out as the publication of choice as most states require law enforcement agencies to submit this data.', u'Preliminary Annual Uniform Crime Report for 2006 was released on June 4, 2006.', u'The report shows violent crime offenses rose 1.3%, but the number of property crime offenses decreased 2.9% compared to 2005.', u'==== National Incident Based Reporting System ====\n\nThe National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) crime statistics system aims to address limitations inherent in UCR data.', u'The system is used by law enforcement agencies in the United States for collecting and reporting data on crimes.', u'Local, state, and federal agencies generate NIBRS data from their records management systems.', u'Data is collected on every incident and arrest in the Group A offense category.', u'The Group A offenses are 46 specific crimes grouped in 22 offense categories.', u'Specific facts about these offenses are gathered and reported in the NIBRS system.', u'In addition to the Group A offenses, eleven Group B offenses are reported with only the arrest information.', u'The NIBRS system is in greater detail than the summary-based UCR system.', u'As of 2004, 5,271 law enforcement agencies submitted NIBRS data.', u'That amount represents 20% of the United States population and 16% of the crime statistics data collected by the FBI.', u'== eGuardian ==\neGuardian is the name of an FBI system, launched in January 2009, to share tips about possible terror threats with local police agencies.', u'The program aims to get law enforcement at all levels sharing data quickly about suspicious activity and people.', u'eGuardian enables near real-time sharing and tracking of terror information and suspicious activities with local, state, tribal, and federal agencies.', u'The eGuardian system is a spin-off of a similar but classified tool called Guardian that has been used inside the FBI, and shared with vetted partners since 2005.', u'== Controversies ==\nThroughout its history, the bureau has been the subject of a number of controversial cases, both at home and abroad.', u'=== Files on US citizens ===\nThe FBI has maintained files on numerous people, including celebrities such as Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, John Denver, John Lennon, Jane Fonda, Groucho Marx, Charlie Chaplin, the band MC5, Lou Costello, Sonny Bono, Bob Dylan, Michael Jackson, and Mickey Mantle.', u'The files were collected for various reasons.', u'Some of the subjects were investigated for alleged ties to the Communist party (Charlie Chaplin and Groucho Marx), or in connection with antiwar activities during the Vietnam War (John Denver, John Lennon, and Jane Fonda).', u'Numerous celebrity files concern threats or extortion attempts against them (Sonny Bono, John Denver, John Lennon, Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, Mickey Mantle, Groucho Marx, and Frank Sinatra).', u'=== Covert operations on political groups ===\nCOINTELPRO tactics have been alleged to include discrediting targets through psychological warfare; smearing individuals and groups using forged documents and by planting false reports in the media; harassment; wrongful imprisonment; and illegal violence.', u'The FBI\'s stated motivation was "protecting national security, preventing violence, and maintaining the existing social and political order."', u'FBI records show that 85% of COINTELPRO resources targeted groups and individuals that the FBI deemed "subversive", including communist and socialist organizations; organizations and individuals associated with the Civil Rights Movement, including Martin Luther King, Jr. and others associated with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and the Congress of Racial Equality and other civil rights organizations; black nationalist groups; the American Indian Movement; a broad range of organizations labeled "New Left", including Students for a Democratic Society and the Weathermen; almost all groups protesting the Vietnam War, as well as individual student demonstrators with no group affiliation; the National Lawyers Guild; organizations and individuals associated with the women\'s rights movement; nationalist groups such as those seeking independence for Puerto Rico, United Ireland, and Cuban exile movements including Orlando Bosch\'s Cuban Power and the Cuban Nationalist Movement.', u"The remaining 15% of COINTELPRO resources were expended to marginalize and subvert white hate groups, including the Ku Klux Klan and the National States' Rights Party.", u'=== Files on Puerto Rican independence advocates ===\nThe FBI also spied upon and collected information on Puerto Rican independence leader Pedro Albizu Campos and his Nationalist political party in the 1930s.', u'Abizu Campos was convicted three times in connection with deadly attacks on US government officials: in 1937 (Conspiracy to overthrow the government of the United States), in 1950 (attempted murder), and in 1954 (after an armed assault on the US House of Representatives while in session; although not present, Abizu Campos was considered the mastermind).', u'The FBI operation was covert and did not become known until U.S.', u'Congressman Luis Gutierrez had it made public via the Freedom of Information Act in the 1980s.', u'In the 2000s, researchers got files released by the FBI under the Freedom of Information Act revealing that the San Juan FBI office had coordinated with FBI offices in New York, Chicago and other cities, in a decades-long surveillance of Albizu Campos and Puerto Ricans who had contact or communication with him.', u'The documents available are as recent as 1965.', u'=== Activities in Latin America ===\nFrom the 1950s to the 1980s, the governments of many Latin American and Caribbean countries were infiltrated by the FBI.', u'=== Internal investigations of shootings ===\nDuring the period from 1993 to 2011, FBI agents fired their weapons on 289 occasions; FBI internal reviews found the shots justified in all but 5 cases, in none of the 5 cases were people wounded.', u'Samuel Walker, a professor of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska Omaha said the number of shots found to be unjustified was "suspiciously low."', u'In the same time period, the FBI wounded 150 people, 70 of whom died; the FBI found all 150 shootings to be justified.', u'Likewise, during the period from 2011 to the present, all shootings by FBI agents have been found to be justified by internal investigation.', u"In a 2002 case in Maryland, an innocent man was shot, and later paid $1.3 million by the FBI after agents mistook him for a bank robber; the internal investigation found that the shooting was justified, based on the man's actions.", u'=== The Whitey Bulger case ===\nThe FBI has been criticized for its handling of Boston organized crime figure Whitey Bulger.', u'Beginning in 1975, Bulger served as an informant for the FBI.', u'As a result, the Bureau largely ignored his organization in exchange for information about the inner workings of the Italian American Patriarca crime family.', u'In December 1994, after being tipped off by his former FBI handler about a pending indictment under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, Bulger fled Boston and went into hiding.', u'For 16 years, he remained at large.', u'For 12 of those years, Bulger was prominently listed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list.', u'Beginning in 1997, the New England media exposed criminal actions by federal, state, and local law enforcement officials tied to Bulger.', u'The revelation caused great embarrassment to the FBI.', u'In 2002, Special Agent John J Connolly was convicted of federal racketeering charges for helping Bulger avoid arrest.', u'In 2008, Special Agent Connolly completed his term on the federal charges and was transferred to Florida where he was convicted of helping plan the murder of John B Callahan, a Bulger rival.', u'In 2014, that conviction was overturned on a technicality.', u'Connolly was the agent leading the investigation of Bulger.', u'In June 2011, the 81-year-old Bulger was arrested in Santa Monica, California.', u'Bulger was tried on 32 counts of racketeering, money laundering, extortion, and weapons charges; including complicity in 19 murders.', u'In August 2013, the jury found him guilty on 31 counts, and having been involved in 11 murders.', u'Bulger was sentenced to two consecutive life terms plus five years.', u'=== Robert Hanssen ===\nOn 20 February 2001, the bureau announced that a special agent, Robert Hanssen (born 1944) had been arrested for spying for the Soviet Union and then Russia from 1979 to 2001.', u'He is serving 15 consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole at ADX Florence, a federal supermax prison near Florence, Colorado.', u'Hanssen was arrested on February 18, 2001, at Foxstone Park near his home in Vienna, Virginia, and was charged with selling US secrets to the USSR and subsequently Russia for more than US$1.4 million in cash and diamonds over a 22-year period.', u'On July 6, 2001, he pleaded guilty to 15 counts of espionage in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.', u'His spying activities have been described by the US Department of Justice\'s Commission for the Review of FBI Security Programs as "possibly the worst intelligence disaster in U.S. history".', u'=== Death of Filiberto Ojeda Rios ===\n\nIn 2005, fugitive Puerto Rican Nationalist leader Filiberto Ojeda R\xedos died in a gun battle with FBI agents in 2005 in what some charged was an assassination.', u'Puerto Rico Governor An\xedbal Acevedo Vil\xe1 criticized the FBI assault as "improper" and "highly irregular" and demanded to know why his government was not informed of it.', u'The FBI refused to release information beyond the official press release, citing security and agent privacy issues.', u"The Puerto Rico Justice Department filed suit in federal court against the FBI and the US Attorney General, demanding information crucial to the Commonwealth's own investigation of the incident.", u'The case was dismissed by the U.S Supreme Court.', u"Ojeda Rios' funeral was attended by a long list of dignitaries, including the highest authority of the Roman Catholic Church in Puerto Rico, Archbishop Roberto Octavio Gonz\xe1lez Nieves, ex-Governor Rafael Hern\xe1ndez Col\xf3n, and numerous other personalities.", u'In the aftermath of his death, the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization approved a draft resolution urging a "probe of [the] pro-independence killing, human rights abuses", after "Petitioner after petitioner condemned the assassination of Mr. Ojeda Rios by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)".', u'=== Wikipedia edits ===\nIn August 2007 Virgil Griffith, a Caltech computation and neural-systems graduate student, created a searchable database that linked changes made by anonymous Wikipedia editors to companies and organizations from which the changes were made.', u'The database cross-referenced logs of Wikipedia edits with publicly available records pertaining to the Internet IP addresses edits were made from.', u'Griffith was motivated by the edits from the United States Congress, and wanted to see if others were similarly promoting themselves.', u'The tool was designed to detect conflict of interest edits.', u'Among his findings were that FBI computers were used to edit the FBI article on Wikipedia.', u'Although the edits correlated with known FBI IP addresses, there was no proof that the changes actually came from a member or employee of the FBI, only that someone who had access to their network had edited the FBI article on Wikipedia.', u'Wikipedia spokespersons received Griffith\'s "WikiScanner" positively, noting that it helped prevent conflicts of interest from influencing articles as well as increasing transparency and mitigating attempts to remove or distort relevant facts.', u"=== Hillary Clinton email investigation ===\n\nOn July 5, 2016, FBI Director Comey announced the bureau's recommendation that the United States Department of Justice file no criminal charges relating to the Hillary Clinton email controversy.", u'During an unusual 15 minute press conference in the J. Edgar Hoover Building, Comey called Secretary Clinton\'s and her top aides\' behavior "extremely careless", but concluded that "no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case".', u'Comey\'s public comments came after Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that she would "fully" accept the recommendation of the FBI regarding the probe.', u'It was the first time the FBI disclosed its prosecutorial recommendation to the Department of Justice publicly.', u"On July 7, 2016, Comey was questioned by a Republican-led House committee during a hearing regarding the FBI's recommendation.", u'On October 28, 2016, less than two weeks before the presidential election, Director Comey, a long-time Republican, announced in a letter to Congress that additional emails potentially related to the Clinton email controversy had been found and that the FBI will investigate "to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation."', u'At the time Comey sent his letter to Congress, the FBI had still not obtained a warrant to review any of the e-mails in question and was not aware of the content of any of the e-mails in question.', u"Comey's announcement was inconsistent with Justice Department policy and he was warned by lawyers at the Department of Justice against proceeding with his letter to Congress.", u'Both Republican and Democrat lawmakers, as well as both the Clinton and Trump campaigns have called on Comey to provide additional details.', u"After Comey's letter to Congress, commentator Paul Callan of CNN and Niall O'Dowd of Irish Central compared Comey to J. Edgar Hoover in attempting to influence and manipulate elections.", u'On October 30, 2016, Richard Painter, chief White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush Administration, published an op-ed piece in the NY Times, stating that he had filed a complaint against the FBI with the Office of Special Counsel, which investigates possible violations of the Hatch Act of 1939, and with the Office of Government Ethics with respect to the sending of the letter.', u"In the days after the FBI intervention, Rudy Giuliani indicated that the Trump campaign was briefed by the FBI days before Comey's letter was sent to Congress.", u"On November 6, 2016, in the face of constant pressure from both Republicans and Democrats, Comey conceded in a second letter to Congress that through the FBI's review of the new e-mails, there was no wrongdoing by Clinton.", u'Comey conceded, "Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July."', u"While the e-mail matter is resolved, legal questions on Comey's actions remain.", u'Comey and the FBI have been broadly criticized on the editorial pages from both the right and the left, with headlines reading: "James Comey should be fired" (Chicago Tribune); "FBI chief James Comey should resign" (The Washington Times); and "FBI Director James Comey is Unfit for Public Service" (Newsweek).', u'== Media portrayal ==\n\nThe FBI has been frequently depicted in popular media since the 1930s.', u'The bureau has participated to varying degrees, which has ranged from direct involvement in the creative process of film or TV series development, to providing consultation on operations and closed cases.', u'A few of the notable portrayals of the FBI on television are the 1993\u20132002 series The X-Files, which concerned investigations into paranormal phenomena by five fictional Special Agents, and the fictional Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU) agency in the TV drama 24, which is patterned after the FBI Counterterrorism Division.', u'The 1991 movie Point Break is based on the true story of an undercover FBI agent who infiltrated a gang of bank robbers.', u'The 1997 movie Donnie Brasco is based on the true story of undercover FBI agent Joseph D. Pistone infiltrating the Mafia.', u'== Notable FBI personnel ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHSI BOOK Government HSI Files\nCharles, Douglas M. (2007).', u'J.

{'sentences': [u'A treaty is an agreement under international law entered into by actors in international law, namely sovereign states and international organizations.', u'A treaty may also be known as an (international) agreement, protocol, covenant, convention, pact, or exchange of letters, among other terms.', u'Regardless of terminology, all of these forms of agreements are, under international law, equally considered treaties and the rules are the same.', u'Treaties can be loosely compared to contracts: both are means of willing parties assuming obligations among themselves, and a party to either that fails to live up to their obligations can be held liable under international law.', u'== Modern usage ==\nA treaty is an official, express written agreement that states use to legally bind themselves.', u'A treaty is the official document which expresses that agreement in words; and it is also the objective outcome of a ceremonial occasion which acknowledges the parties and their defined relationships.', u'== Modern form ==\nSince the late 19th century, most treaties have followed a fairly consistent format.', u'A treaty typically begins with a preamble describing the contracting parties and their joint objectives in executing the treaty, as well as summarizing any underlying events (such as a war).', u'Modern preambles are sometimes structured as a single very long sentence formatted into multiple paragraphs for readability, in which each of the paragraphs begins with a verb (desiring, recognizing, having, and so on).', u"The contracting parties' full names or sovereign titles are often included in the preamble, along with the full names and titles of their representatives, and a boilerplate clause about how their representatives have communicated (or exchanged) their full powers (i.e., the official documents appointing them to act on behalf of their respective states) and found them in good or proper form.", u'The end of the preamble and the start of the actual agreement is often signaled by the words "have agreed as follows."', u"After the preamble comes numbered articles, which contain the substance of the parties' actual agreement.", u'Each article heading usually encompasses a paragraph.', u'A long treaty may further group articles under chapter headings.', u'Modern treaties, regardless of subject matter, usually contain articles governing where the final authentic copies of the treaty will be deposited and how any subsequent disputes as to their interpretation will be peacefully resolved.', u'The end of a treaty, the eschatocol (or closing protocol), is often signaled by a clause like "in witness whereof" or "in faith whereof," the parties have affixed their signatures, followed by the words "DONE at," then the site(s) of the treaty\'s execution and the date(s) of its execution.', u'The date is typically written in its most formal, longest possible form.', u'For example, the Charter of the United Nations was "DONE at the city of San Francisco the twenty-sixth day of June, one thousand nine hundred and forty-five."', u'If the treaty is executed in multiple copies in different languages, that fact is always noted, and is followed by a stipulation that the versions in different languages are equally authentic.', u"The signatures of the parties' representatives follow at the very end.", u'When the text of a treaty is later reprinted, such as in a collection of treaties currently in effect, an editor will often append the dates on which the respective parties ratified the treaty and on which it came into effect for each party.', u'== Bilateral and Multilateral Treaties ==\nBilateral treaties are concluded between two states or entities.', u'It is possible, however, for a bilateral treaty to have more than two parties; consider for instance the bilateral treaties between Switzerland and the European Union (EU) following the Swiss rejection of the European Economic Area agreement.', u'Each of these treaties has seventeen parties.', u'These however are still bilateral, not multilateral, treaties.', u'The parties are divided into two groups, the Swiss ("on the one part") and the EU and its member states ("on the other part").', u'The treaty establishes rights and obligations between the Swiss and the EU and the member states severally\u2014it does not establish any rights and obligations amongst the EU and its member states.', u'A multilateral treaty is concluded among several countries.', u'The agreement establishes rights and obligations between each party and every other party.', u'Multilateral treaties are often regional.', u'Treaties of "mutual guarantee" are international compacts, e.g., the Treaty of Locarno which guarantees each signatory against attack from another.', u"== Adding and amending treaty obligations ==\n\n\n=== Reservations ===\n\nReservations are essentially caveats to a state's acceptance of a treaty.", u'Reservations are unilateral statements purporting to exclude or to modify the legal obligation and its effects on the reserving state.', u'These must be included at the time of signing or ratification, i.e.', u'"a party cannot add a reservation after it has already joined a treaty".', u'Originally, international law was unaccepting of treaty reservations, rejecting them unless all parties to the treaty accepted the same reservations.', u'However, in the interest of encouraging the largest number of states to join treaties, a more permissive rule regarding reservations has emerged.', u'While some treaties still expressly forbid any reservations, they are now generally permitted to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the goals and purposes of the treaty.', u'When a state limits its treaty obligations through reservations, other states party to that treaty have the option to accept those reservations, object to them, or object and oppose them.', u"If the state accepts them (or fails to act at all), both the reserving state and the accepting state are relieved of the reserved legal obligation as concerns their legal obligations to each other (accepting the reservation does not change the accepting state's legal obligations as concerns other parties to the treaty).", u'If the state opposes, the parts of the treaty affected by the reservation drop out completely and no longer create any legal obligations on the reserving and accepting state, again only as concerns each other.', u'Finally, if the state objects and opposes, there are no legal obligations under that treaty between those two state parties whatsoever.', u'The objecting and opposing state essentially refuses to acknowledge the reserving state is a party to the treaty at all.', u'=== Amendments ===\nThere are three ways an existing treaty can be amended.', u'First, formal amendment requires State parties to the treaty to go through the ratification process all over again.', u'The re-negotiation of treaty provisions can be long and protracted, and often some parties to the original treaty will not become parties to the amended treaty.', u'When determining the legal obligations of states, one party to the original treaty and one a party to the amended treaty, the states will only be bound by the terms they both agreed upon.', u'Treaties can also be amended informally by the treaty executive council when the changes are only procedural, technical change in customary international law can also amend a treaty, where state behavior evinces a new interpretation of the legal obligations under the treaty.', u'Minor corrections to a treaty may be adopted by a proc\xe8s-verbal; but a proc\xe8s-verbal is generally reserved for changes to rectify obvious errors in the text adopted, i.e.', u'where the text adopted does not correctly reflect the intention of the parties adopting it.', u'=== Protocols ===\n\nIn international law and international relations, a protocol is generally a treaty or international agreement that supplements a previous treaty or international agreement.', u'A protocol can amend the previous treaty, or add additional provisions.', u'Parties to the earlier agreement are not required to adopt the protocol.', u'Sometimes this is made clearer by calling it an "optional protocol", especially where many parties to the first agreement do not support the protocol.', u'Some examples: the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) established a framework for the development of binding greenhouse gas emission limits, while the Kyoto Protocol contained the specific provisions and regulations later agreed upon.', u"== Execution and implementation ==\nTreaties may be seen as 'self-executing', in that merely becoming a party puts the treaty and all of its obligations in action.", u"Other treaties may be non-self-executing and require 'implementing legislation'\u2014a change in the domestic law of a state party that will direct or enable it to fulfill treaty obligations.", u'An example of a treaty requiring such legislation would be one mandating local prosecution by a party for particular crimes.', u'The division between the two is often not clear and is often politicized in disagreements within a government over a treaty, since a non-self-executing treaty cannot be acted on without the proper change in domestic law.', u'If a treaty requires implementing legislation, a state may be in default of its obligations by the failure of its legislature to pass the necessary domestic laws.', u'=== Interpretation ===\nThe language of treaties, like that of any law or contract, must be interpreted when the wording does not seem clear or it is not immediately apparent how it should be applied in a perhaps unforeseen circumstance.', u'The Vienna Convention states that treaties are to be interpreted "in good faith" according to the "ordinary meaning given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose."', u"International legal experts also often invoke the 'principle of maximum effectiveness,' which interprets treaty language as having the fullest force and effect possible to establish obligations between the parties.", u'No one party to a treaty can impose its particular interpretation of the treaty upon the other parties.', u'Consent may be implied, however, if the other parties fail to explicitly disavow that initially unilateral interpretation, particularly if that state has acted upon its view of the treaty without complaint.', u"Consent by all parties to the treaty to a particular interpretation has the legal effect of adding another clause to the treaty \u2013 this is commonly called an 'authentic interpretation'.", u'International tribunals and arbiters are often called upon to resolve substantial disputes over treaty interpretations.', u'To establish the meaning in context, these judicial bodies may review the preparatory work from the negotiation and drafting of the treaty as well as the final, signed treaty itself.', u'=== Consequences of terminology ===\nOne significant part of treaty making is that signing a treaty implies recognition that the other side is a sovereign state and that the agreement being considered is enforceable under international law.', u'Hence, nations can be very careful about terming an agreement to be a treaty.', u'For example, within the United States, agreements between states are compacts and agreements between states and the federal government or between agencies of the government are memoranda of understanding.', u'Another situation can occur when one party wishes to create an obligation under international law, but the other party does not.', u'This factor has been at work with respect to discussions between North Korea and the United States over security guarantees and nuclear proliferation.', u'The terminology can also be confusing because a treaty may and usually is named something other than a treaty, such as a convention, protocol, or simply agreement.', u'Conversely some legal documents such as the Treaty of Waitangi are internationally considered to be documents under domestic law.', u'== Ending treaty obligations ==\n\n\n=== Withdrawal ===\nTreaties are not necessarily permanently binding upon the signatory parties.', u'As obligations in international law are traditionally viewed as arising only from the consent of states, many treaties expressly allow a state to withdraw as long as it follows certain procedures of notification.', u'For example, the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs provides that the treaty will terminate if, as a result of denunciations, the number of parties falls below 40.', u'Many treaties expressly forbid withdrawal.', u'Article 56 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties provides that where a treaty is silent over whether or not it can be denounced there is a rebuttable presumption that it cannot be unilaterally denounced unless:\nit can be shown that the parties intended to admit the possibility, or\na right of withdrawal can be inferred from the terms of the treaty.', u'The possibility of withdrawal depends on the terms of the treaty and its travaux preparatoire.', u'It has, for example, been held that it is not possible to withdraw from the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.', u'When North Korea declared its intention to do this the Secretary-General of the United Nations, acting as registrar, said that original signatories of the ICCPR had not overlooked the possibility of explicitly providing for withdrawal, but rather had deliberately intended not to provide for it.', u'Consequently, withdrawal was not possible.', u'In practice, because of sovereignty, any state can purport to withdraw from any treaty at any time, and cease to abide by its terms.', u'The question of whether this is lawful can be regarded as the success or failure to anticipate community acquiescence or enforcement, that is, how other states will react; for instance, another state might impose sanctions or go to war over a treaty violation.', u"If a state party's withdrawal is successful, its obligations under that treaty are considered terminated, and withdrawal by one party from a bilateral treaty of course terminates the treaty.", u'When a state withdraws from a multi-lateral treaty, that treaty will still otherwise remain in force among the other parties, unless, of course, otherwise should or could be interpreted as agreed upon between the remaining states parties to the treaty.', u'=== Suspension and termination ===\nIf a party has materially violated or breached its treaty obligations, the other parties may invoke this breach as grounds for temporarily suspending their obligations to that party under the treaty.', u'A material breach may also be invoked as grounds for permanently terminating the treaty itself.', u'A treaty breach does not automatically suspend or terminate treaty relations, however.', u'It depends on how the other parties regard the breach and how they resolve to respond to it.', u'Sometimes treaties will provide for the seriousness of a breach to be determined by a tribunal or other independent arbiter.', u"An advantage of such an arbiter is that it prevents a party from prematurely and perhaps wrongfully suspending or terminating its own obligations due to another's alleged material breach.", u'Treaties sometimes include provisions for self-termination, meaning that the treaty is automatically terminated if certain defined conditions are met.', u'Some treaties are intended by the parties to be only temporarily binding and are set to expire on a given date.', u'Other treaties may self-terminate if the treaty is meant to exist only under certain conditions.', u'A party may claim that a treaty should be terminated, even absent an express provision, if there has been a fundamental change in circumstances.', u'Such a change is sufficient if unforeseen, if it undermined the \u201cessential basis\u201d of consent by a party, if it radically transforms the extent of obligations between the parties, and if the obligations are still to be performed.', u'A party cannot base this claim on change brought about by its own breach of the treaty.', u'This claim also cannot be used to invalidate treaties that established or redrew political boundaries.', u'== Invalid treaties ==\nThere are several reasons an otherwise valid and agreed upon treaty may be rejected as a binding international agreement, most of which involve problems created at the formation of the treaty.', u'For example, the serial Japan-Korea treaties of 1905, 1907 and 1910 were protested; and they were confirmed as "already null and void" in the 1965 Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea.', u"=== Ultra vires treaties ===\nA party's consent to a treaty is invalid if it had been given by an agent or body without power to do so under that state's domestic law.", u'States are reluctant to inquire into the internal affairs and processes of other states, and so a "manifest violation" is required such that it would be "objectively evident to any State dealing with the matter".', u'A strong presumption exists internationally that a head of state has acted within his proper authority.', u'It seems that no treaty has ever actually been invalidated on this provision.', u'Consent is also invalid if it is given by a representative who ignored restrictions he is subject to by his sovereign during the negotiations, if the other parties to the treaty were notified of those restrictions prior to his signing.', u'According to the preamble in The Law of Treaties, treaties are a source of international law.', u'If an act or lack thereof is condemned under international law, the act will not assume international legality even if approved by internal law.', u'This means that in case of a conflict with domestic law, international law will always prevail.', u'=== Misunderstanding, fraud, corruption, coercion ===\nArticles 46\u201353 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties set out the only ways that treaties can be invalidated\u2014considered unenforceable and void under international law.', u'A treaty will be invalidated due to either the circumstances by which a state party joined the treaty, or due to the content of the treaty itself.', u'Invalidation is separate from withdrawal, suspension, or termination (addressed above), which all involve an alteration in the consent of the parties of a previously valid treaty rather than the invalidation of that consent in the first place.', u'A state\'s consent may be invalidated if there was an erroneous understanding of a fact or situation at the time of conclusion, which formed the "essential basis" of the state\'s consent.', u"Consent will not be invalidated if the misunderstanding was due to the state's own conduct, or if the truth should have been evident.", u'Consent will also be invalidated if it was induced by the fraudulent conduct of another party, or by the direct or indirect "corruption" of its representative by another party to the treaty.', u'Coercion of either a representative, or the state itself through the threat or use of force, if used to obtain the consent of that state to a treaty, will invalidate that consent.', u'=== Contrary to peremptory norms ===\nA treaty is null and void if it is in violation of a peremptory norm.', u'These norms, unlike other principles of customary law, are recognized as permitting no violations and so cannot be altered through treaty obligations.', u'These are limited to such universally accepted prohibitions as those against the aggressive use of force, genocide and other crimes against humanity, piracy, hostilities directed at civilian population, racial discrimination and apartheid, slavery and torture, meaning that no state can legally assume an obligation to commit or permit such acts.', u'== Role of the United Nations ==\nThe United Nations Charter states that treaties must be registered with the UN to be invoked before it or enforced in its judiciary organ, the International Court of Justice.', u'This was done to prevent the proliferation of secret treaties that occurred in the 19th and 20th century.', u"Section 103 of the Charter also states that its members' obligations under it outweigh any competing obligations under other treaties.", u'After their adoption, treaties as well as their amendments have to follow the official legal procedures of the United Nations, as applied by the Office of Legal Affairs, including signature, ratification and entry into force.', u'In function and effectiveness, the UN has been compared to the pre-Constitutional United States Federal government by some, giving a comparison between modern treaty law and the historical Articles of Confederation.', u'== Relation between national law and treaties by country ==\n\n\n=== Brazilian law ===\nThe Brazilian federal constitution states that the power to enter into treaties is vested in the president and that such treaties must be approved by Congress (articles 84, clause VIII, and 49, clause I).', u'In practice, this has been interpreted as meaning that the executive branch is free to negotiate and sign a treaty, but its ratification by the president is contingent upon the prior approval of Congress.', u'Additionally, the Federal Supreme Court has ruled that, following ratification and entry into force, a treaty must be incorporated into domestic law by means of a presidential decree published in the federal register in order to be valid in Brazil and applicable by the Brazilian authorities.', u'The Federal Supreme Court has established that treaties are subject to constitutional review and enjoy the same hierarchical position as ordinary legislation (leis ordin\xe1rias, or "ordinary laws", in Portuguese).', u'A more recent ruling by the Supreme Court in 2008 has altered that scheme somewhat, by stating that treaties containing human rights provisions enjoy a status above that of ordinary legislation, though they remain beneath the constitution itself.', u'Additionally, as per the 45th amendment to the constitution, human rights treaties which are approved by Congress by means of a special procedure enjoy the same hierarchical position as a constitutional amendment.', u'The hierarchical position of treaties in relation to domestic legislation is of relevance to the discussion on whether (and how) the latter can abrogate the former and vice versa.', u'The Brazilian federal constitution does not have a supremacy clause with the same effects as the one on the U.S. constitution, a fact that is of interest to the discussion on the relation between treaties and state legislation.', u'=== United States law ===\n\nIn the United States, the term "treaty" has a different, more restricted legal sense than exists in international law.', u'United States law distinguishes what it calls treaties from executive agreement, congressional-executive agreements, and sole executive agreements.', u'All four classes are equally treaties under international law; they are distinct only from the perspective of internal American law.', u'The distinctions are primarily concerning their method of approval.', u'Whereas treaties require advice and consent by two-thirds of the Senators present, sole executive agreements may be executed by the President acting alone.', u'Some treaties grant the President the authority to fill in the gaps with executive agreements, rather than additional treaties or protocols.', u'And finally, congressional-executive agreements require majority approval by both the House and the Senate, either before or after the treaty is signed by the President.', u'Currently, international agreements are executed by executive agreement rather than treaties at a rate of 10:1.', u'Despite the relative ease of executive agreements, the President still often chooses to pursue the formal treaty process over an executive agreement in order to gain congressional support on matters that require the Congress to pass implementing legislation or appropriate funds, and those agreements that impose long-term, complex legal obligations on the United States.', u'For example, the deal by the United States, Iran and other countries is not a Treaty.', u'See the article on the Bricker Amendment for history of the relationship between treaty powers and Constitutional provisions.', u'The Supreme Court ruled in the Head Money Cases that "treaties" do not have a privileged position over Acts of Congress and can be repealed or modified (for the purposes of U.S. law) by any subsequent Act of Congress, just like with any other regular law.', u'The Supreme Court also ruled in Reid v. Covert that any treaty provision that conflicts with the Constitution are null and void under U.S. law.', u'=== Indian law ===\nIn India, the legislation subjects are divided into 3 lists -Union List, State List and Concurrent List .', u'In the normal legislation process, the subjects in Union list can only be legislated upon by central legislative body called Parliament of India, for subjects in state list only respective state legislature can legislate.', u'While for Concurrent subjects, both center and state can make laws.', u'But to implement international treaties, Parliament can legislate on any subject overriding the general division of subject lists.', u'== Treaties and indigenous peoples ==\nTreaties formed an important part of European colonization and, in many parts of the world, Europeans attempted to legitimize their sovereignty by signing treaties with indigenous peoples.', u'In most cases these treaties were in extremely disadvantageous terms to the native people, who often did not appreciate the implications of what they were signing.', u'In some rare cases, such as with Ethiopia and Qing Dynasty China, the local governments were able to use the treaties to at least mitigate the impact of European colonization.', u'This involved learning the intricacies of European diplomatic customs and then using the treaties to prevent a power from overstepping their agreement or by playing different powers against each other.', u'In other cases, such as New Zealand and Canada, treaties allowed native peoples to maintain a minimum amount of autonomy.', u'In the case of indigenous Australians, unlike with the M\u0101ori of New Zealand, no treaty was ever entered into with the indigenous peoples entitling the Europeans to land ownership, under the doctrine of terra nullius (later overturned by Mabo v Queensland, establishing the concept of native title well after colonization was already a fait accompli).', u'Such treaties between colonizers and indigenous peoples are an important part of political discourse in the late 20th and early 21st century, the treaties being discussed have international standing as has been stated in a treaty study by the UN.', u'Prior to 1871, the government of the United States regularly entered into treaties with Native Americans but the Indian Appropriations Act of March 3, 1871 (ch.', u'120, 16 Stat.', u'563) had a rider (25 U.S.C.', u'\xa7 71) attached that effectively ended the President\u2019s treaty making by providing that no Indian nation or tribe shall be acknowledged as an independent nation, tribe, or power with whom the United States may contract by treaty.', u'The federal government continued to provide similar contractual relations with the Indian tribes after 1871 by agreements, statutes, and executive orders.', u'== See also ==\nPeace treaty\nJus tractatuum\nList of intergovernmental organizations\nList of treaties\nManrent (feudal Scottish Clan treaty)\nTreaty ratification\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nKorean Mission to the Conference on the Limitation of Armament, Washington, D.C., 1921\u20131922.', u'(1922).', u"Korea's Appeal to the Conference on Limitation of Armament.", u'Washington: U.S. Government Printing Office.', u'OCLC 12923609\nNicolson, Harold.', u'(1936).', u'Diplomacy, 1st ed.', u'Oxford: Oxford University Press.', u'OCLC 502863836\nShaw, Malcolm Nathan.', u'(1977).', u'International Law, 1st ed.', u'Sevenoaks, Kent: Hodder and Stoughton.', u'OCLC 637940121\nTimothy L.

{'sentences': [u'Michel de Nostredame (depending on the source, 14 or 21 December 1503 \u2013 2 July 1566), usually Latinised as Nostradamus, was a French physician and reputed seer who published collections of prophecies that have since become widely famous.', u'He is best known for his book Les Propheties, the first edition of which appeared in 1555.', u'Since the publication of this book, which has rarely been out of print since his death, Nostradamus has attracted a following that, along with much of the popular press, credits him with predicting many major world events.', u"Most academic sources maintain that the associations made between world events and Nostradamus's quatrains are largely the result of misinterpretations or mistranslations (sometimes deliberate) or else are so tenuous as to render them useless as evidence of any genuine predictive power.", u'== Childhood ==\nBorn on either 14 or 21 December 1503 in Saint-R\xe9my-de-Provence, Provence, France, where his claimed birthplace still exists, Michel de Nostredame was one of at least nine children of notary Jaume (or Jacques) de Nostredame and Reyni\xe8re, granddaughter of Pierre de Saint-R\xe9my who worked as a physician in Saint-R\xe9my.', u'Jaume\'s family had originally been Jewish, but his father, Cresquas, a grain and money dealer, based in Avignon, had converted to Catholicism around 1459-60, taking the Christian name "Pierre" and the surname "Nostredame" (Our Lady), the saint on whose day his conversion was solemnised.', u'The earliest ancestor who can be identified on the paternal side is Astruge of Carcassonne, who died about 1420.', u"Michel's known siblings included Delphine, Jean (c. 1507\u201377), Pierre, Hector, Louis, Bertrand, Jean II (born 1522) and Antoine (born 1523).", u'Little else is known about his childhood, although there is a persistent tradition that he was educated by his maternal great-grandfather Jean de St. R\xe9my \u2014 a tradition which is somewhat undermined by the fact that the latter disappears from the historical record after 1504, when the child was only one year old.', u'== Student years ==\nAt the age of 15 Nostredame entered the University of Avignon to study for his baccalaureate.', u'After little more than a year (when he would have studied the regular trivium of grammar, rhetoric and logic, rather than the later quadrivium of geometry, arithmetic, music and astronomy/astrology), he was forced to leave Avignon when the university closed its doors during an outbreak of the plague.', u'After leaving Avignon, Nostredame, by his own account, traveled the countryside for eight years from 1521 researching herbal remedies.', u'In 1529, after some years as an apothecary, he entered the University of Montpellier to study for a doctorate in medicine.', u'He was expelled shortly afterwards by the student procurator, Guillaume Rondelet, when it was discovered that he had been an apothecary, a "manual trade" expressly banned by the university statutes, and had been slandering doctors.', u'The expulsion document, BIU Montpellier, Register S 2 folio 87, still exists in the faculty library.', u'However, some of his publishers and correspondents would later call him "Doctor".', u'After his expulsion, Nostredame continued working, presumably still as an apothecary, and became famous for creating a "rose pill" that purportedly protected against the plague.', u'== Marriage and healing work ==\nIn 1531 Nostredame was invited by Jules-C\xe9sar Scaliger, a leading Renaissance scholar, to come to Agen.', u"There he married a woman of uncertain name (possibly Henriette d'Encausse), who bore him two children.", u'In 1534 his wife and children died, presumably from the plague.', u'After their deaths, he continued to travel, passing through France and possibly Italy.', u'On his return in 1545, he assisted the prominent physician Louis Serre in his fight against a major plague outbreak in Marseille, and then tackled further outbreaks of disease on his own in Salon-de-Provence and in the regional capital, Aix-en-Provence.', u'Finally, in 1547, he settled in Salon-de-Provence in the house which exists today, where he married a rich widow named Anne Ponsarde, with whom he had six children\u2014three daughters and three sons.', u'Between 1556 and 1567 he and his wife acquired a one-thirteenth share in a huge canal project organised by Adam de Craponne to irrigate largely waterless Salon-de-Provence and the nearby D\xe9sert de la Crau from the river Durance.', u'== Seer ==\nAfter another visit to Italy, Nostredame began to move away from medicine and toward the occult.', u'Following popular trends, he wrote an almanac for 1550, for the first time Latinising his name from Nostredame to Nostradamus.', u"He was so encouraged by the almanac's success that he decided to write one or more annually.", u'Taken together, they are known to have contained at least 6,338 prophecies, as well as at least eleven annual calendars, all of them starting on 1 January and not, as is sometimes supposed, in March.', u'It was mainly in response to the almanacs that the nobility and other prominent persons from far away soon started asking for horoscopes and "psychic" advice from him, though he generally expected his clients to supply the birth charts on which these would be based, rather than calculating them himself as a professional astrologer would have done.', u"When obliged to attempt this himself on the basis of the published tables of the day, he frequently made errors and failed to adjust the figures for his clients' place or time of birth.", u'He then began his project of writing a book of one thousand mainly French quatrains, which constitute the largely undated prophecies for which he is most famous today.', u'Feeling vulnerable to opposition on religious grounds, however, he devised a method of obscuring his meaning by using "Virgilianised" syntax, word games and a mixture of other languages such as Greek, Italian, Latin, and Proven\xe7al.', u'For technical reasons connected with their publication in three installments (the publisher of the third and last installment seems to have been unwilling to start it in the middle of a "Century," or book of 100 verses), the last fifty-eight quatrains of the seventh "Century" have not survived in any extant edition.', u'The quatrains, published in a book titled Les Propheties (The Prophecies), received a mixed reaction when they were published.', u'Some people thought Nostradamus was a servant of evil, a fake, or insane, while many of the elite evidently thought otherwise.', u"Catherine de M\xe9dicis, wife of King Henry II of France, was one of Nostradamus' greatest admirers.", u'After reading his almanacs for 1555, which hinted at unnamed threats to the royal family, she summoned him to Paris to explain them and to draw up horoscopes for her children.', u'At the time, he feared that he would be beheaded, but by the time of his death in 1566, Queen Catherine had made him Counselor and Physician-in-Ordinary to her son, the young King Charles IX of France.', u"Some accounts of Nostradamus's life state that he was afraid of being persecuted for heresy by the Inquisition, but neither prophecy nor astrology fell in this bracket, and he would have been in danger only if he had practiced magic to support them.", u'In 1538 he came into conflict with the Church in Agen after an Inquisitor visited the area looking for Anti-Catholic views.', u'His brief imprisonment at Marignane in late 1561 was solely because he had violated a recent royal decree by publishing his 1562 almanac without the prior permission of a bishop.', u"== Final years and death ==\n\nBy 1566, Nostradamus's gout, which had plagued him painfully for many years and made movement very difficult, turned into edema, or dropsy.", u'In late June he summoned his lawyer to draw up an extensive will bequeathing his property plus 3,444 crowns (around $300,000 US today), minus a few debts, to his wife pending her remarriage, in trust for her sons pending their twenty-fifth birthdays and her daughters pending their marriages.', u'This was followed by a much shorter codicil.', u'On the evening of 1 July, he is alleged to have told his secretary Jean de Chavigny, "You will not find me alive at sunrise."', u'The next morning he was reportedly found dead, lying on the floor next to his bed and a bench (Presage 141 [originally 152] for November 1567, as posthumously edited by Chavigny to fit what happened).', u'He was buried in the local Franciscan chapel in Salon (part of it now incorporated into the restaurant La Brocherie) but re-interred during the French Revolution in the Coll\xe9giale Saint-Laurent, where his tomb remains to this day.', u'== Works ==\n\nIn The Prophecies Nostradamus compiled his collection of major, long-term predictions.', u'The first installment was published in 1555 and contained 353 quatrains.', u'The third edition, with three hundred new quatrains, was reportedly printed in 1558, but now only survives as part of the omnibus edition that was published after his death in 1568.', u'This version contains one unrhymed and 941 rhymed quatrains, grouped into nine sets of 100 and one of 42, called "Centuries".', u'Given printing practices at the time (which included type-setting from dictation), no two editions turned out to be identical, and it is relatively rare to find even two copies that are exactly the same.', u'Certainly there is no warrant for assuming\u2014as would-be "code-breakers" are prone to do\u2014that either the spellings or the punctuation of any edition are Nostradamus\' originals.', u'The Almanacs, by far the most popular of his works, were published annually from 1550 until his death.', u'He often published two or three in a year, entitled either Almanachs (detailed predictions), Prognostications or Presages (more generalised predictions).', u'Nostradamus was not only a diviner, but a professional healer.', u'It is known that he wrote at least two books on medical science.', u"One was an extremely free translation (or rather a paraphrase) of The Protreptic of Galen (Paraphrase de C. GALIEN, sus l'Exhortation de Menodote aux estudes des bonnes Artz, mesmement Medicine), and in his so-called Trait\xe9 des fardemens (basically a medical cookbook containing, once again, materials borrowed mainly from others) he included a description of the methods he used to treat the plague, including bloodletting, none of which apparently worked.", u'The same book also describes the preparation of cosmetics.', u'A manuscript normally known as the Orus Apollo also exists in the Lyon municipal library, where upwards of 2,000 original documents relating to Nostradamus are stored under the aegis of Michel Chomarat.', u'It is a purported translation of an ancient Greek work on Egyptian hieroglyphs based on later Latin versions, all of them unfortunately ignorant of the true meanings of the ancient Egyptian script, which was not correctly deciphered until Champollion in the 19th century.', u'Since his death, only the Prophecies have continued to be popular, but in this case they have been quite extraordinarily so.', u'Over two hundred editions of them have appeared in that time, together with over 2,000 commentaries.', u'Their persistence in popular culture seems to be partly because their vagueness and lack of dating make it easy to quote them selectively after every major dramatic event and retrospectively claim them as "hits".', u'== Origins of The Prophecies ==\n\nNostradamus claimed to base his published predictions on judicial astrology\u2014the astrological \'judgment\', or assessment, of the \'quality\' (and thus potential) of events such as births, weddings, coronations etc.\u2014but was heavily criticised by professional astrologers of the day such as Laurens Videl for incompetence and for assuming that "comparative horoscopy" (the comparison of future planetary configurations with those accompanying known past events) could actually predict what would happen in the future.', u'Research suggests that much of his prophetic work paraphrases collections of ancient end-of-the-world prophecies (mainly Bible-based), supplemented with references to historical events and anthologies of omen reports, and then projects those into the future in part with the aid of comparative horoscopy.', u'Hence the many predictions involving ancient figures such as Sulla, Gaius Marius, Nero, and others, as well as his descriptions of "battles in the clouds" and "frogs falling from the sky."', u"Astrology itself is mentioned only twice in Nostradamus's Preface and 41 times in the Centuries themselves, but more frequently in his dedicatory Letter to King Henry II.", u'In the last quatrain of his sixth century he specifically attacks astrologers.', u'His historical sources include easily identifiable passages from Livy, Suetonius, Plutarch and other classical historians, as well as from medieval chroniclers such as Geoffrey of Villehardouin and Jean Froissart.', u"Many of his astrological references are taken almost word for word from Richard Roussat's Livre de l'estat et mutations des temps of 1549\u201350.", u'One of his major prophetic sources was evidently the Mirabilis Liber of 1522, which contained a range of prophecies by Pseudo-Methodius, the Tiburtine Sibyl, Joachim of Fiore, Savonarola and others (his Preface contains 24 biblical quotations, all but two in the order used by Savonarola).', u'This book had enjoyed considerable success in the 1520s, when it went through half a dozen editions, but did not sustain its influence, perhaps owing to its mostly Latin text, Gothic script and many difficult abbreviations.', u'Nostradamus was one of the first to re-paraphrase these prophecies in French, which may explain why they are credited to him.', u'It should be noted that modern views of plagiarism did not apply in the 16th century; authors frequently copied and paraphrased passages without acknowledgement, especially from the classics.', u'The latest research suggests that he may in fact have used bibliomancy for this\u2014randomly selecting a book of history or prophecy and taking his cue from whatever page it happened to fall open at.', u"Further material was gleaned from the De honesta disciplina of 1504 by Petrus Crinitus, which included extracts from Michael Psellos's De daemonibus, and the De Mysteriis Aegyptiorum (Concerning the mysteries of Egypt...), a book on Chaldean and Assyrian magic by Iamblichus, a 4th-century Neo-Platonist.", u'Latin versions of both had recently been published in Lyon, and extracts from both are paraphrased (in the second case almost literally) in his first two verses, the first of which is appended to this article.', u'While it is true that Nostradamus claimed in 1555 to have burned all of the occult works in his library, no one can say exactly what books were destroyed in this fire.', u'Only in the 17th century did people start to notice his reliance on earlier, mainly classical sources.', u'This may help explain the fact that, during the same period, The Prophecies reportedly came into use in France as a classroom reader.', u'Nostradamus\'s reliance on historical precedent is reflected in the fact that he explicitly rejected the label "prophet" (i.e.', u'a person having prophetic powers of his own) on several occasions:\n\nAlthough, my son, I have used the word prophet, I would not attribute to myself a title of such lofty sublimity\u2014Preface to C\xe9sar, 1555 (see caption to illustration above)\n\nNot that I would attribute to myself either the name or the role of a prophet\u2014Preface to C\xe9sar, 1555\n\n[S]ome of [the prophets] predicted great and marvelous things to come: [though] for me, I in no way attribute to myself such a title here.\u2014Letter to King Henry II, 1558\n\nNot that I am foolish enough to claim to be a prophet.\u2014Open letter to Privy Councillor (later Chancellor) Birague, 15 June 1566\n\nHis rejection of the title prophet is consistent with the fact that he entitled his book Les Propheties de M. Michel Nostradamus (a title that, in French, as easily means "The Prophecies, by M. Michel Nostradamus"\u2014which is what they were\u2014as "The Prophecies of M. Michel Nostradamus", which, except in a few cases, they were not, other than in the manner of their editing, expression and reapplication to the future).', u'Given this reliance on literary sources, it is doubtful whether Nostradamus used any particular methods for entering a trance state, other than contemplation, meditation and incubation.', u"His sole description of this process is contained in letter 41' of his collected Latin correspondence.", u'The popular legend that he attempted the ancient methods of flame gazing, water gazing or both simultaneously is based on a naive reading of his first two verses, which merely liken his efforts to those of the Delphic and Branchidic oracles.', u'The first of these is reproduced at the bottom of this article and the second can be seen by visiting the relevant facsimile site (see External Links).', u'In his dedication to King Henri II, Nostradamus describes "emptying my soul, mind and heart of all care, worry and unease through mental calm and tranquility", but his frequent references to the "bronze tripod" of the Delphic rite are usually preceded by the words "as though" (compare, once again, External References to the original texts).', u'== Interpretations ==\nMost of the quatrains deal with disasters, such as plagues, earthquakes, wars, floods, invasions, murders, droughts, and battles\u2014all undated and based on foreshadowings by the Mirabilis Liber.', u'Some quatrains cover these disasters in overall terms; others concern a single person or small group of people.', u'Some cover a single town, others several towns in several countries.', u'A major, underlying theme is an impending invasion of Europe by Muslim forces from farther east and south headed by the expected Antichrist, directly reflecting the then-current Ottoman invasions and the earlier Saracen equivalents, as well as the prior expectations of the Mirabilis Liber.', u'All of this is presented in the context of the supposedly imminent end of the world\u2014even though this is not in fact mentioned\u2014a conviction that sparked numerous collections of end-time prophecies at the time, including an unpublished collection by Christopher Columbus.', u'Nostradamus has been credited, for the most part in hindsight, with predicting numerous events in world history, from the Great Fire of London, and the rise of Napoleon and Adolf Hitler, to the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center.', u"In 1992 one commentator who claimed to be able to contact Nostradamus under hypnosis even had him 'interpreting' his own verse X.6 (a prediction specifically about floods in southern France around the city of N\xeemes and people taking refuge in its collosse, or Colosseum, a Roman amphitheatre now known as the Ar\xe8nes) as a prediction of an undated attack on the Pentagon, despite the historical seer's clear statement in his dedicatory letter to King Henri II that his prophecies were about Europe, North Africa and part of Asia Minor.", u'Skeptics such as James Randi suggest that his reputation as a prophet is largely manufactured by modern-day supporters who fit his words to events that have either already occurred or are so imminent as to be inevitable, a process sometimes known as "retroactive clairvoyance" (postdiction).', u'Thus, no Nostradamus quatrain is known to have been interpreted as predicting a specific event before it occurred, other than in vague, general terms that could equally apply to any number of other events.', u'This even applies to quatrains that contain specific dates, such as III.77, which predicts "in 1727, in October, the king of Persia [shall be] captured by those of Egypt"\u2014a prophecy that has, as ever, been interpreted retrospectively in the light of later events, in this case as though it presaged the known peace treaty between the Ottoman Empire and Persia of that year.', u"Similarly, Nostradamus's notorious '1999' prophecy at X.72 (see Nostradamus in popular culture) describes no event that commentators have succeeded in identifying either before or since, other than by dint of twisting the words to fit whichever of the many contradictory happenings they are keen to claim as 'hits'.", u'Moreover, no quatrain suggests, as is often claimed by books and films on the alleged Mayan Prophecy, that the world would end in December 2012.', u"In his preface to the Prophecies, Nostradamus himself stated that his prophecies extend 'from now to the year 3797'\u2014an extraordinary date which, given that the preface was written in 1555, may have more than a little to do with the fact that 2242 (3797 \u2212 1555) had recently been proposed by his major astrological source Richard Roussat as a possible date for the end of the world.", u'== Alternative views ==\nViews on Nostradamus have varied widely throughout history.', u"At one end of the spectrum, there are extreme academic views such as those of Jacques Halbronn, who has suggested at great length and with great complexity that Nostradamus's Prophecies are antedated forgeries written by later hands with a political axe to grind.", u'No other major source accepts this view [see reference-list].', u'At the other end of the spectrum, there are numerous fairly recent popular books, and thousands of private websites, suggesting not only that the Prophecies are genuine but that Nostradamus was a true prophet.', u'Due to the subjective nature of these interpretations, however, no two of them agree on exactly what he predicted, whether for the past or for the future.', u'Many of these do agree, though, that particular predictions refer, for example, to the French Revolution, Napoleon, Adolf Hitler, both world wars, and the nuclear destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.', u"There is also an evident consensus among popular authors that he predicted whatever major event had just happened at the time of each book's publication, from the Apollo moon landings, through the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997, and the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986, to the events of 9/11: this 'movable feast' aspect appears to be characteristic of the genre.", u"Possibly the first of these books to become popular in English was Henry C. Roberts' The Complete Prophecies of Nostradamus of 1947, reprinted at least seven times during the next forty years, which contained both transcriptions and translations, with brief commentaries.", u"This was followed in 1961 (reprinted in 1982) by Edgar Leoni's Nostradamus and His Prophecies.", u"After that came Erika Cheetham's The Prophecies of Nostradamus, incorporating a reprint of the posthumous 1568 edition, which was reprinted, revised and republished several times from 1973 onwards, latterly as The Final Prophecies of Nostradamus.", u'This served as the basis for the documentary The Man Who Saw Tomorrow and both did indeed mention possible generalised future attacks on New York (via nuclear weapons), though not specifically on the World Trade Center or on any particular date.', u"A two-part translation of Jean-Charles de Fontbrune's Nostradamus: historien et proph\xe8te was published in 1980, and John Hogue has published a number of books on Nostradamus from about 1987 including Nostradamus and the Millenium: Predictions of the Future, Nostradamus: The Complete Prophecies (1999) and Nostradamus: A Life and Myth (2003).", u"With the exception of Roberts, these books and their many popular imitators were almost unanimous not merely about Nostradamus's powers of prophecy, but also about various aspects of his biography.", u'He had been a descendant of the Israelite tribe of Issachar; he had been educated by his grandfathers, who had both been physicians to the court of Good King Ren\xe9 of Provence; he had attended Montpellier University in 1525 to gain his first degree; after returning there in 1529, he had successfully taken his medical doctorate; he had gone on to lecture in the Medical Faculty there, until his views became too unpopular; he had supported the heliocentric view of the universe; he had travelled to the north-east of France, where he had composed prophecies at the abbey of Orval; in the course of his travels, he had performed a variety of prodigies, including identifying future Pope, Sixtus V, who was then only a seminary monk.', u'He is credited with having successfully cured the Plague at Aix-en-Provence and elsewhere; he had engaged in scrying, using either a magic mirror or a bowl of water; he had been joined by his secretary Chavigny at Easter 1554; having published the first installment of his Propheties, he had been summoned by Queen Catherine de\' Medici to Paris in 1556 to discuss with her his prophecy at quatrain I.35 that her husband King Henri II would be killed in a duel; he had examined the royal children at Blois; he had bequeathed to his son a "lost book" of his own prophetic paintings; he had been buried standing up; and he had been found, when dug up at the French Revolution, to be wearing a medallion bearing the exact date of his disinterment.', u'Curiously, this particular story seems to have been first recorded by Samuel Pepys as early as 1667, long before the French Revolution.', u'Pepys records in his celebrated diary a legend that, before his death, Nostradamus made the townsfolk swear that his grave would never be disturbed; but that 60 years later his body was exhumed, whereupon a brass plaque was found on his chest correctly stating the date and time when his grave would be opened and cursing the exhumers.', u'From the 1980s onwards, however, an academic reaction set in, especially in France.', u"The publication in 1983 of Nostradamus's private correspondence and, during succeeding years, of the original editions of 1555 and 1557 discovered by Chomarat and Benazra, together with the unearthing of much original archival material revealed that much that was claimed about Nostradamus did not fit the documented facts.", u'The academics revealed that not one of the claims just listed was backed up by any known contemporary documentary evidence.', u'Most of them had evidently been based on unsourced rumours relayed as fact by much later commentators, such as Jaubert (1656), Guynaud (1693) and Bareste (1840), on modern misunderstandings of the 16th-century French texts, or on pure invention.', u"Even the often-advanced suggestion that quatrain I.35 had successfully prophesied King Henri II's death did not actually appear in print for the first time until 1614, 55 years after the event.", u'Additionally, the academics, who themselves tend to eschew any attempt at interpretation, complained that the English translations were usually of poor quality, seemed to display little or no knowledge of 16th-century French, were tendentious and, at worst, were sometimes twisted to fit the events to which they were supposed to refer (or vice versa).', u'None of them were based on the original editions: Roberts had based his writings on that of 1672, Cheetham and Hogue on the posthumous edition of 1568.', u'Even Leoni accepted on page 115 that he had never seen an original edition, and on earlier pages he indicated that much of his biographical material was unsourced.', u'However, none of this research and criticism was originally known to most of the English-language commentators, by function of the dates when they were writing and, to some extent, of the language in which it was written.', u'Hogue was in a position to take advantage of it, but it was only in 2003 that he accepted that some of his earlier biographical material had in fact been apocryphal.', u'Meanwhile, some of the more recent sources listed (Lemesurier, Gruber, Wilson) have been particularly scathing about later attempts by some lesser-known authors and Internet enthusiasts to extract alleged hidden meanings from the texts, whether with the aid of anagrams, numerical codes, graphs or otherwise.', u'== In popular culture ==\n\nThe prophecies retold and expanded by Nostradamus figured largely in popular culture in the 20th and 21st centuries.', u"As well as being the subject of hundreds of books (both fiction and nonfiction), Nostradamus's life has been depicted in several films and videos, and his life and writings continue to be a subject of media interest.", u'There have also been several well-known Internet hoaxes, where quatrains in the style of Nostradamus have been circulated by e-mail as the real thing.', u'The best-known examples concern the collapse of the World Trade Center in the 11 September attacks, which led both to hoaxes and to reinterpretations by enthusiasts of several quatrains as supposed prophecies.', u"With the arrival of the year 2012, Nostradamus's prophecies started to be co-opted (especially by the History Channel) as evidence suggesting that the end of the world was imminent, notwithstanding the fact that his book never mentions the end of the world, let alone the year 2012.", u'== See also ==\n\nFor comparison with another predictive protoscience see Alchemy.', u'Divination\nList of astrologers\nMysticism\nRoger Frontenac\nVaticinia Nostradami\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nGerson, St\xe9phane.', u'Nostradamus: How an Obscure Renaissance Astrologer Became the Modern Prophet of Doom (New York: St. Martin\u2019s Press, 2012) 347pp\nSmoley, Richard, The Essential Nostradamus (Tarcher, Penguin, NY, 2006)\n\n\n== External links =='], 'year': '1566-07-02', 'title': 'French astrologer physician & prophet Nostradamus dies in Salon'}
{'sentences': [u'John Couch Adams FRS (5 June 1819 \u2013 21 January 1892) was a British mathematician and astronomer.', u'Adams was born in Laneast, near Launceston, Cornwall, and died in Cambridge.', u'The Cornish name Couch is pronounced "cooch".', u'His most famous achievement was predicting the existence and position of Neptune, using only mathematics.', u"The calculations were made to explain discrepancies with Uranus's orbit and the laws of Kepler and Newton.", u'At the same time, but unknown to each other, the same calculations were made by Urbain Le Verrier.', u"Le Verrier would send his coordinates to Berlin Observatory astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle, who confirmed the existence of the planet on 23 September 1846, finding it within 1\xb0 of Le Verrier's predicted location (there was, and to some extent still is, some controversy over the apportionment of credit for the discovery; see Discovery of Neptune).", u'He was Lowndean Professor in the University of Cambridge from 1859 until his death.', u'He won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1866.', u'In 1884, he attended the International Meridian Conference as a delegate for Britain.', u'A crater on the Moon is jointly named after him, Walter Sydney Adams and Charles Hitchcock Adams.', u"Neptune's outermost known ring and the asteroid 1996 Adams are also named after him.", u'The Adams Prize, presented by the University of Cambridge, commemorates his prediction of the position of Neptune.', u'His personal library is held at Cambridge University Library.', u'== Early life ==\n\nAdams was born at Lidcot, a farm at Laneast, near Launceston, Cornwall, the eldest of seven children.', u'His parents were Thomas Adams (1788\u20131859), a poor tenant farmer, and his wife, Tabitha Knill Grylls (1796\u20131866).', u"The family were devout Wesleyans who enjoyed music and among John's brothers, Thomas became a missionary, George a farmer, and William Grylls Adams, professor of natural philosophy and astronomy at King's College London.", u"Tabitha was a farmer's daughter but had received a rudimentary education from John Couch, her uncle, whose small library she had inherited.", u'John was intrigued by the astronomy books from an early age.', u'John attended the Laneast village school where he acquired some Greek and algebra.', u"From there, he went, at the age of twelve, to Devonport, where his mother's cousin, the Rev.", u'John Couch Grylls, kept a private school.', u"There he learned classics but was largely self-taught in mathematics, studying in the Library of Devonport Mechanics' Institute and reading Rees's Cyclop\xe6dia and Samuel Vince's Fluxions.", u"He observed Halley's comet in 1835 from Landulph and the following year started to make his own astronomical calculations, predictions and observations, engaging in private tutoring to finance his activities.", u'In 1836, his mother inherited a small estate at Badharlick and his promise as a mathematician induced his parents to send him to the University of Cambridge.', u"In October 1839 he entered as a sizar at St John's College, graduating B.A.", u"in 1843 as senior wrangler and first Smith's prizeman of his year.", u"== Discovery of Neptune ==\n\nIn 1821, Alexis Bouvard had published astronomical tables of the orbit of Uranus, making predictions of future positions based on Newton's laws of motion and gravitation.", u'Subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from the tables, leading Bouvard to hypothesize some perturbing body.', u'Adams learnt of the irregularities while still an undergraduate and became convinced of the "perturbation" theory.', u"Adams believed, in the face of anything that had been attempted before, that he could use the observed data on Uranus, and utilising nothing more than Newton's law of gravitation, deduce the mass, position and orbit of the perturbing body.", u'On 3 July 1841, he noted his intention to work on the problem.', u'After his final examinations in 1843, Adams was elected fellow of his college and spent the summer vacation in Cornwall calculating the first of six iterations.', u'While he worked on the problem back in Cambridge, he tutored undergraduates, sending money home to educate his brothers, and even taught his bedmaker to read.', u'Apparently, Adams communicated his work to James Challis, director of the Cambridge Observatory, in mid-September 1845 but there is some controversy as to how.', u'On 21 October 1845, Adams, returning from a Cornwall vacation, without appointment, twice called on Astronomer Royal George Biddell Airy in Greenwich.', u'Failing to find him at home, Adams reputedly left a manuscript of his solution, again without the detailed calculations.', u'Airy responded with a letter to Adams asking for some clarification.', u'It appears that Adams did not regard the question as "trivial", as is often alleged, but he failed to complete a response.', u"Various theories have been discussed as to Adams's failure to reply, such as his general nervousness, procrastination and disorganisation.", u'Meanwhile, Urbain Le Verrier, on 10 November 1845, presented to the Acad\xe9mie des sciences in Paris a memoir on Uranus, showing that the pre-existing theory failed to account for its motion.', u"On reading Le Verrier's memoir, Airy was struck by the coincidence and initiated a desperate race for English priority in discovery of the planet.", u'The search was begun by a laborious method on 29 July.', u'Only after the discovery of Neptune on 23 September 1846 had been announced in Paris did it become apparent that Neptune had been observed on 8 and 12 August but because Challis lacked an up-to-date star-map it was not recognized as a planet.', u'A keen controversy arose in France and England as to the merits of the two astronomers.', u'As the facts became known, there was wide recognition that the two astronomers had independently solved the problem of Uranus, and each was ascribed equal importance.', u'However, there have been subsequent assertions that "The Brits Stole Neptune" and that Adams\'s British contemporaries retrospectively ascribed him more credit than he was due.', u"But it is also notable (and not included in some of the foregoing discussion references) that Adams himself publicly acknowledged Le Verrier's priority and credit (not forgetting to mention the role of Galle) in the paper that he gave 'On the Perturbations of Uranus' to the Royal Astronomical Society in November 1846:-\n\nI mention these dates merely to show that my results were arrived at independently, and previously to the publication of those of M. Le Verrier, and not with the intention of interfering with his just claims to the honours of the discovery ; for there is no doubt that his researches were first published to the world, and led to the actual discovery of the planet by Dr. Galle, so that the facts stated above cannot detract, in the slightest degree, from the credit due to M. Le Verrier.", u'Adams held no bitterness towards Challis or Airy and acknowledged his own failure to convince the astronomical world:\n\nI could not expect however that practical astronomers, who were already fully occupied with important labours, would feel as much confidence in the results of my investigations, as I myself did.', u"== Adams' style of working ==\nHis lay fellowship at St John's College came to an end in 1852, and the existing statutes did not permit his re-election.", u'However, Pembroke College, which possessed greater freedom, elected him in the following year to a lay fellowship which he held for the rest of his life.', u'Despite the fame of his work on Neptune, Adams also did much important work on gravitational astronomy and terrestrial magnetism.', u'He was particularly adept at fine numerical calculations, often making substantial revisions to the contributions of his predecessors.', u'However, he was "extraordinarily uncompetitive, reluctant to publish imperfect work to stimulate debate or claim priority, averse to correspondence about it, and forgetful in practical matters".', u'It has been suggested that these are symptoms of Asperger syndrome which would also be consistent with the "repetitive behaviours and restricted interests" necessary to perform the Neptune calculations, in addition to his difficulties in personal interaction with Challis and Airy.', u"In 1852, he published new and accurate tables of the moon's parallax, which superseded Johann Karl Burckhardt's, and supplied corrections to the theories of Marie-Charles Damoiseau, Giovanni Antonio Amedeo Plana, and Philippe Gustave Doulcet.", u'He had hoped that this work would leverage him into the vacant post as superintendent of HM Nautical Almanac Office but John Russell Hind was preferred, Adams lacking the necessary ability as an organiser and administrator.', u"== Lunar theory \u2014 Secular acceleration of the Moon ==\nSince ancient times, the Moon's mean rate of motion relative to the stars had been treated as a constant rate, but in 1695, Edmond Halley had suggested that this mean rate was gradually increasing.", u'Later, during the eighteenth century, Richard Dunthorne estimated the rate as +10" (arcseconds/century2) in terms of the resulting difference in lunar longitude, an effect that became known as the secular acceleration of the Moon.', u"Pierre-Simon Laplace had given an explanation in 1787 in terms of changes in the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit.", u'He considered only the radial gravitational force on the Moon, from the Sun and Earth but obtained close agreement with the historical record of observations.', u"In 1820, at the insistence of the Acad\xe9mie des sciences, Damoiseau, Plana and Francesco Carlini revisited Laplace's work, investigating quadratic and higher-order perturbing terms, and obtained similar results, again addressing only a radial, and neglecting tangential, gravitational force on the Moon.", u'Hansen obtained similar results in 1842 and 1847.', u'In 1853, Adams published a paper showing that, while tangential terms vanish in the first-order theory of Laplace, they become substantial when quadratic terms are admitted.', u'Small terms integrated in time come to have large effects and Adams concluded that Plana had overestimated the secular acceleration by approximately 1.66" per century.', u"At first, Le Verrier rejected Adams's results.", u"In 1856, Plana admitted Adams's conclusions, claiming to have revised his own analysis and arrived at the same results.", u"However, he soon recanted, publishing a third result different both from Adams's and Plana's own earlier work.", u"Delaunay in 1859 calculated the fourth-order term and duplicated Adams's result leading Adams to publish his own calculations for the fifth, sixth and seventh-order terms.", u'Adams now calculated that only 5.7" of the observed 11" was accounted for by gravitational effects.', u'Later that year, Philippe Gustave Doulcet, Comte de Pont\xe9coulant published a claim that the tangential force could have no effect though Peter Andreas Hansen, who seems to have cast himself in the role of arbitrator, declared that the burden of proof rested on Pont\xe9coulant, while lamenting the need to discover a further effect to account for the balance.', u'Much of the controversy centred around the convergence of the power series expansion used and, in 1860, Adams duplicated his results without using a power series.', u"Sir John Lubbock also duplicated Adams's results and Plana finally concurred.", u"Adams's view was ultimately accepted and further developed, winning him the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1866.", u'The unexplained drift is now known to be due to tidal acceleration.', u'In 1858 Adams became professor of mathematics at the University of St Andrews, but lectured only for a session, before returning to Cambridge for the Lowndean professorship of astronomy and geometry.', u'Two years later he succeeded Challis as director of the Cambridge Observatory, a post Adams held until his death.', u'== The Leonids ==\n\nThe great meteor shower of November 1866 turned his attention to the Leonids, whose probable path and period had already been discussed and predicted by Hubert Anson Newton in 1864.', u"Newton had asserted that the longitude of the ascending node, that marked where the shower would occur, was increasing and the problem of explaining this variation attracted some of Europe's leading astronomers.", u'Using a powerful and elaborate analysis, Adams ascertained that this cluster of meteors, which belongs to the solar system, traverses an elongated ellipse in 33.25 years, and is subject to definite perturbations from the larger planets, Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.', u'These results were published in 1867.', u"Some experts consider this Adams's most substantial achievement.", u'His "definitive orbit" for the Leonids coincided with that of the comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle and therefore suggested the, later widely accepted, close relationship between comets and meteors.', u'== Later career ==\n\nTen years later, George William Hill described a novel and elegant method for attacking the problem of lunar motion.', u"Adams briefly announced his own unpublished work in the same field, which, following a parallel course had confirmed and supplemented Hill's.", u"Over a period of forty years, he periodically addressed the determination of the constants in Carl Friedrich Gauss's theory of terrestrial magnetism.", u'Again, the calculations involved great labour, and were not published during his lifetime.', u'They were edited by his brother, William Grylls Adams, and appear in the second volume of the collected Scientific Papers.', u'Numerical computation of this kind might almost be described as his pastime.', u'He calculated the Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant, perhaps somewhat eccentrically, to 236 decimal places and evaluated the Bernoulli numbers up to the 62nd.', u"Adams had boundless admiration for Newton and his writings and many of his papers bear the cast of Newton's thought.", u"In 1872, Isaac Newton Wallop, 5th Earl of Portsmouth donated his private collection of Newton's papers to Cambridge University.", u'Adams and G. G. Stokes took on the task or arranging the material, publishing a catalogue in 1888.', u'The post of Astronomer Royal was offered him in 1881, but he preferred to pursue his teaching and research in Cambridge.', u'He was British delegate to the International Meridian Conference at Washington in 1884, when he also attended the meetings of the British Association at Montreal and of the American Association at Philadelphia.', u"== Honours ==\n1847 He is reputed to have been offered a knighthood on Queen Victoria's 1847 Cambridge visit but to have declined, either out of modesty, or fear of the financial consequences of such social distinction;\n1847 Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences;\n1848 Copley medal of the Royal Society;\n1848 Adams Prize, founded by the members of St John's College, to be given biennially for the best treatise on a mathematical subject;\n1849 Elected Fellow of the Royal Society of London and Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh\n1851 and 1874 President of the Royal Astronomical Society (1851\u20131853 and 1874\u20131876).", u'== Family and death ==\nAfter a long illness, Adams died at Cambridge on 21 January 1892 and was buried near his home in St Giles Cemetery, now the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge.', u'In 1863 he had married Miss Eliza Bruce (1827\u20131919), of Dublin, who survived him, and is buried with him.', u'His wealth at death was \xa332,434 (\xa32.6 million at 2003 prices).', u"== Memorials ==\nMemorial in Westminster Abbey with a portrait medallion, by Albert Bruce-Joy;\nA bust, by Joy in the hall of St John's College, Cambridge;\nAnother youthful bust belongs to the Royal Astronomical Society;\nPortraits by:\nHubert von Herkomer in Pembroke College;\nPaul Raphael Montord in the combination room of St John's;\n\nA memorial tablet, with an inscription by Archbishop Benson, in Truro Cathedral;\nPassmore Edwards erected a public institute in his honour at Launceston, near his birthplace.", u'Adams Nunatak, a nunatak on Neptune Glacier in Alexander Island in Antarctica, is named after him\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Chisholm, Hugh, ed.', u'(1911).', u'"Adams, John Couch".', u'Encyclop\xe6dia Britannica (11th ed.).', u'Cambridge University Press.', u'=== Obituaries ===\nThe Times, 22 January 1892, p. 6 col.d (link on this page)\n[Anon.]', u'(1892).', u'"John Couch Adams".', u'Astronomical Journal.', u'11: 112.', u'Bibcode:1892AJ.....11..112.. doi:10.1086/101653.', u'J.

{'sentences': [u'An aquarium (plural: aquariums or aquaria) is a vivarium of any size having at least one transparent side in which water-dwelling plants or animals are kept and displayed.', u'Fishkeepers use aquaria to keep fish, invertebrates, amphibians, aquatic reptiles such as turtles, and aquatic plants.', u'The term, coined by English naturalist Philip Henry Gosse, combines the Latin root aqua, meaning water, with the suffix -arium, meaning "a place for relating to".', u'The aquarium principle was fully developed in 1850 by the chemist Robert Warington, who explained that plants added to water in a container would give off enough oxygen to support animals, so long as their numbers do not grow too large.', u'The aquarium craze was launched in early Victorian England by Gosse, who created and stocked the first public aquarium at the London Zoo in 1853, and published the first manual, The Aquarium: An Unveiling of the Wonders of the Deep Sea in 1854.', u'An aquarist owns fish or maintains an aquarium, typically constructed of glass or high-strength acrylic.', u'Cuboid aquaria are also known as fish tanks or simply tanks, while bowl-shaped aquaria are also known as fish bowls.', u'Size can range from a small glass bowl to immense public aquaria.', u"Specialized equipment maintains appropriate water quality and other characteristics suitable for the aquarium's residents.", u'== History and popularization ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nIn the Roman Empire, the first fish to be brought indoors was the sea barbel, which was kept under guest beds in small tanks made of marble.', u'Introduction of glass panes around the year 50 AD allowed Romans to replace one wall of marble tanks, improving their view of the fish.', u'In 1369, the Hongwu Emperor of China established a porcelain company that produced large porcelain tubs for maintaining goldfish; over time, people produced tubs that approached the shape of modern fish bowls.', u'Leonhard Baldner, who wrote Vogel-, Fisch- und Tierbuch (Bird, Fish, and Animal Book) in 1666, maintained weather loaches and newts.', u'=== Nineteenth century ===\n\nIn 1832, Jeanne Villepreux-Power, a pioneering French marine biologist, became the first person to create aquaria for experimenting with aquatic organisms.', u'In 1836, soon after his invention of the Wardian case, Dr. Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward proposed to use his tanks for tropical animals.', u'In 1841 he did so, though only with aquatic plants and toy fish.', u'However, he soon housed real animals.', u'In 1838, F\xe9lix Dujardin noted owning a saltwater aquarium, though he did not use the term.', u'In 1846, Anne Thynne maintained stony corals and seaweed for almost three years, and was credited as the creator of the first balanced marine aquarium in London.', u'English chemist Robert Warington experimented with a 13-gallon container, which contained goldfish, eelgrass, and snails, creating one of the first stable aquaria.', u'The aquarium principle was fully developed by Warington, explaining that plants added to water in a container would give off enough oxygen to support animals, so long as their numbers do not grow too large.', u"He published his findings in 1850 in the Chemical Society's journal.", u'The keeping of fish in an aquarium became a popular hobby and spread quickly.', u'In the United Kingdom, it became popular after ornate aquaria in cast-iron frames were featured at the Great Exhibition of 1851.', u'In 1853, the aquarium craze was launched in England by Philip Henry Gosse who created and stocked the first public aquarium in the London Zoo which came to be known as the Fish House.', u'Gosse coined the word "aquarium", opting for this term (instead of "aquatic vivarium" or "aqua-vivarium") in 1854 in his book The Aquarium: An Unveiling of the Wonders of the Deep Sea.', u'In this book, Gosse primarily discussed saltwater aquaria.', u'In the 1850s, the aquarium became a fad in the United Kingdom.', u'Tank designs and techniques for maintaining water quality were developed by Warington, later cooperating with Gosse until his critical review of the tank water composition.', u'Edward Edwards developed these glass-fronted aquaria in his 1858 patent for a "dark-water-chamber slope-back tank", with water slowly circulating to a reservoir beneath.', u'Germans soon rivaled the British in their interest.', u'In 1854, an anonymous author had two articles published about the saltwater aquaria of the United Kingdom: Die Gartenlaube (The Garden House) entitled Der Ocean auf dem Tische (The Ocean on the Table).', u'However, in 1856, Der See im Glase (The Lake in a Glass) was published, discussing freshwater aquaria, which were much easier to maintain in landlocked areas.', u'In 1862 William Alford Lloyd, then bankrupt because of the craze in England being over, moved to Grindel Dammthor, Hamburg, to supervise the installation of the circulating system and tanks at the Hamburg Aquarium.', u'During the 1870s, some of the first aquarist societies were appearing in Germany.', u'The United States soon followed.', u"Published in 1858, Henry D. Butler's The Family Aquarium was one of the first books written in the United States solely about the aquarium.", u'According to the July issue of The North American Review of the same year, William Stimson may have owned some of the first functional aquaria, and had as many as seven or eight.', u'The first aquarist society in the United States was founded in New York City in 1893, followed by others.', u"The New York Aquarium Journal, first published in October 1876, is considered to be the world's first aquarium magazine.", u'In the Victorian era in the United Kingdom, a common design for the home aquarium was a glass front with the other sides made of wood (made watertight with a pitch coating).', u'The bottom would be made of slate and heated from below.', u'More advanced systems soon began to be introduced, along with tanks of glass in metal frames.', u'During the latter half of the 19th century, a variety of aquarium designs were explored, such as hanging the aquarium on a wall, mounting it as part of a window, or even combining it with a birdcage.', u'=== Twentieth century ===\n\nAround 1908, the first mechanical aquarium air pump was invented, powered by running water, instead of electricity.', u'The introduction of the air pump into the hobby is considered by several historians of the hobby to be a pivotal moment in its development.', u'Aquaria became more widely popular as houses had an electricity supply after World War I.', u'Electricity allowed artificial lighting, as well as aeration, filtration, and heating of the water.', u'Initially, amateur aquarists kept native fish (with the exception of goldfish); the availability of exotic species from overseas further increased the popularity of the aquarium.', u'Jugs made from a variety of materials were used to import fish from overseas, with a bicycle foot pump for aeration.', u'Plastic shipping bags were introduced in the 1950s, making it easier to ship fish.', u'The eventual availability of air freight allowed fish to be successfully imported from distant regions.', u'In the 1960s, metal frames made marine aquaria almost impossible due to corrosion, but the development of tar and silicone sealant allowed the first all-glass aquaria made by Martin Horowitz in Los Angeles, CA.', u'The frames remained, however, though purely for aesthetic reasons.', u'In the United States, as of 1996, aquarium keeping is the second-most popular hobby after stamp collecting.', u'In 1999, an estimated 9.6 million US households owned an aquarium.', u'Figures from the 2005/2006 APPMA National Pet Owners Survey report that Americans own approximately 139 million freshwater fish and 9.6 million saltwater fish.', u'Estimates of the numbers of fish kept in aquaria in Germany suggest at least 36 million.', u'The hobby has the strongest following in Europe, Asia, and North America.', u'In the United States, 40% of aquarists maintain two or more tanks.', u'== Design ==\n\n\n=== Materials ===\nMost aquaria consist of glass panes bonded together by 100% silicone sealant, with plastic frames attached to the upper and lower edges for decoration.', u'The glass aquarium is standard for sizes up to about 1,000 litres (260 US gal; 220 imp gal).', u'However, glass as a material is brittle and has very little give before fracturing, though generally the sealant fails first.', u'Aquaria are made in a variety of shapes, such as cuboid, hexagonal, angled to fit in a corner (L-shaped), and bow-front (the front side curves outwards).', u'Fish bowls are generally either made of plastic or glass, and are either spherical or some other round configuration in shape.', u'The very first modern aquarium made of glass was developed in the 19th century by Robert Warrington.', u'During the Victorian age, glass aquariums commonly had slate or steel bottoms, which allowed them to be heated underneath by an open-flame heat source.', u'These aquariums had the glass panels attached with metal frames and sealed with putty.', u'Metal-framed aquariums were still available until the mid-1960s, when the modern, silicone-sealed style replaced them.', u'Acrylic aquariums first became available to the public in the 1970s.', u'Laminated glass is sometimes used, which combines the advantages of both glass and acrylic.', u'Glass aquaria have been a popular choice for many home and hobbyist aquarists for many years.', u'Once silicone sealant became strong enough to ensure a long-term water-tight seal, it eliminated the need for a structural frame.', u'In addition to lower cost, glass aquaria are more scratch resistant than acrylic.', u'Although the price is one of the main considerations for aquarists when deciding which of these two types of aquaria to purchase, for very large tanks, the price difference tends to disappear.', u'Acrylic aquaria are now the primary competitor with glass.', u'Prior to the invention of UV stabilization, early acrylic aquaria discolored over time with exposure to light; this is no longer the case.', u'Acrylic is generally stronger than glass, weighs less, and provides a certain amount of temperature insulation.', u'In colder climates or environments, it is easier to achieve and maintain a tropical temperature and requires less capacity from an aquarium heater.', u'Acrylic-soluble cements are used to directly fuse acrylic together.', u'Acrylic allows for the formation of unusual shapes, such as the hexagonal tank.', u'Compared to glass, acrylics are easier to scratch; but unlike glass, it is possible to polish out scratches in acrylic.', u'Large aquaria might instead use stronger materials such as fiberglass-reinforced plastics.', u'However, this material is not transparent.', u'Reinforced concrete is used for aquaria where weight and space are not factors.', u'Concrete must be coated with a waterproof layer to prevent the water from breaking down the concrete, as well as preventing contamination of the water by the concrete.', u'=== Styles ===\n\nObjects used for aquariums include: coffee tables, sinks, gumball machines and even toilets.', u'Another such example is the MacQuarium, an aquarium made from the shell of an Apple Macintosh computer.', u'In recent years, elaborate custom-designed home aquariums costing hundreds of thousands of dollars have become status symbols\u2014according to The New York Times, "among people of means, a dazzling aquarium is one of the last surefire ways to impress their peers."', u'==== Kreisel ====\n\nA kreisel tank ("kreisel" being German for "spinning top" or "gyroscope") is an aquarium shaped like a horizontal cylinder that is designed to hold delicate animals such as jellyfish and newborn seahorses.', u'These aquariums provide slow, circular water flow with a bare minimum of interior hardware to prevent the inhabitants from becoming injured by pumps or the tank itself.', u'The tank has no sharp angles around its sides and keeps the housed animals away from plumbing.', u'Water moving into the tank gives a gentle flow that keeps the inhabitants suspended.', u'Water leaves the tank through a screen which prevents animals from being drawn into the pump intake or overflow line.', u'There are several types of kreisel tanks.', u'In a true kreisel, a circular tank has a circular, submerged lid.', u'Pseudokreisels are "U" or semicircle shaped, usually without a lid.', u'Stretch kreisels are a "double gyre" kreisel design, where the tank length is at least twice the height.', u'Using two downwelling inlets on both sides of the tank lets gravity create two gyres in the tank.', u'A single downwelling inlet may be used in the middle as well.', u'The top of a stretch kreisel may be open or closed with a lid.', u'There may also be screens about midway down the sides of the tank, or at the top on the sides.', u'It is possible to combine these designs; a circular shaped tank is used without a lid or cover, and the surface of the water acts as the continuation of circular flow.', u'It is now possible to start a jellyfish aquarium at home as easily as a regular fish tank.', u'==== Biotope ====\nAnother popular setup is the biotope aquarium.', u'A biotope aquarium is a recreation of a specific natural environment.', u'Some of the most popular biotopes are the freshwater habitats of the Amazon and Rio Negro rivers, the African rift lake environments of Lake Malawi and Lake Tanganyika, and saltwater coral reefs of Australia, the Red Sea, and the Caribbean.', u'The fish, plants, substrate, rocks, wood, coral, and any other component of the display should completely match that of the local natural environment.', u'It can be a challenge to recreate such environments, and most "true" biotopes will only have a few (if not only one) species of fish and invertebrates.', u'Finally, an emerging concept for the home is that of a wall mounted aquarium, some of which are displayed at the Living Art Marine Center.', u'=== Aquarium size and volume ===\n\nAn aquarium can range from a small glass bowl containing less than 1 litre (2.1 US pt) of water to immense public aquaria that house entire ecosystems such as kelp forests.', u'Relatively large home aquaria resist rapid fluctuations of temperature and pH, allowing for greater system stability.', u'Beginner aquarists are advised to consider larger tanks to begin with, as controlling water parameters in smaller tanks can prove difficult.', u'Unfiltered bowl-shaped aquaria are now widely regarded as unsuitable for most fish.', u'Advanced alternatives are now available.', u'In order to keep water conditions at suitable levels, aquariums should contain at least two forms of filtration: biological and mechanical.', u'Chemical filtration should also be considered under some circumstances for optimum water quality.', u'Chemical filtration is frequently achieved via activated carbon, to filter medications, tannins, and/or other known impurities from the water.', u'Reef aquaria under 100 litres (26 US gal; 22 imp gal) have a special place in the aquarium hobby; these aquaria, termed nano reefs (when used in reefkeeping), have a small water volume, under 40 litres (11 US gal; 9 imp gal).', u'Practical limitations, most notably the weight of water (1 kilogram per litre (8.345 lb/U.S.', u'gal; 10.022 lb/imp gal)) and internal water pressure (requiring thick glass siding) of a large aquarium, restrict most home aquaria to a maximum of around 1 cubic metre in volume (1000 L, weighing 1,000 kg or 2,200 lb).', u'Some aquarists, however, have constructed aquaria of many thousands of litres.', u'Public aquariums designed for exhibition of large species or environments can be dramatically larger than any home aquarium.', u'The Georgia Aquarium, for example, features an individual aquarium of 6,300,000 US gallons (24,000 m3).', u'==== Nano aquariums ====\nA new trend is to have very small aquariums, termed mini aquariums (less than 150 litres or 40 gallons) or nano aquariums (less than 75 litres or 20 gallons).', u'These can be either freshwater or saltwater, and are intended to display a tiny but self-contained ecosystem.', u"== Components ==\n\nThe typical hobbyist aquarium includes a filtration system, an artificial lighting system, and a heater or chiller depending on the aquarium's inhabitants.", u'Many aquaria incorporate a hood, containing the lights, to decrease evaporation and prevent fish from leaving the aquarium (and anything else from entering the aquarium).', u'Combined biological and mechanical aquarium filtration systems are common.', u'These either convert ammonia to nitrate (removing nitrogen at the expense of aquatic plants), or to sometimes remove phosphate.', u'Filter media can house microbes that mediate nitrification.', u'Filtration systems are sometimes the most complex component of home aquaria.', u'Aquarium heaters combine a heating element with a thermostat, allowing the aquarist to regulate water temperature at a level above that of the surrounding air, whereas coolers and chillers (refrigeration devices) are for use anywhere, such as cold water aquaria, where the ambient room temperature is above the desired tank temperature.', u'Thermometers used include glass alcohol thermometers, adhesive external plastic strip thermometers, and battery-powered LCD thermometers.', u'In addition, some aquarists use air pumps attached to airstones or water pumps to increase water circulation and supply adequate gas exchange at the water surface.', u'Wave-making devices have also been constructed to provide wave action.', u"An aquarium's physical characteristics form another aspect of aquarium design.", u"Size, lighting conditions, density of floating and rooted plants, placement of bog-wood, creation of caves or overhangs, type of substrate, and other factors (including an aquarium's positioning within a room) can all affect the behavior and survival of tank inhabitants.", u'An aquarium can be placed on an aquarium stand.', u'Because of the weight of the aquarium, a stand must be strong as well as level.', u'A tank that is not level may distort, leak, or crack.', u'These are often built with cabinets to allow storage, available in many styles to match room decor.', u'Simple metal tank stands are also available.', u'Most aquaria should be placed on polystyrene to cushion any irregularities on the underlying surface or the bottom of the tank itself that may cause cracks.', u'However, some tanks have an underframe making this unnecessary.', u'== Aquarium maintenance ==\n\nLarge volumes of water enable more stability in a tank by diluting effects from death or contamination events that push an aquarium away from equilibrium.', u'The bigger the tank, the easier such a systemic shock is to absorb, because the effects of that event are diluted.', u'For example, the death of the only fish in a 11-litre (3 US gal; 2 imp gal) tank causes dramatic changes in the system, while the death of that same fish in a 400-litre (110 US gal; 88 imp gal) tank with many other fish in it represents only a minor change.', u'For this reason, hobbyists often favor larger tanks, as they require less attention.', u'Several nutrient cycles are important in the aquarium.', u'Dissolved oxygen enters the system at the surface water-air interface.', u'Similarly, carbon dioxide escapes the system into the air.', u'The phosphate cycle is an important, although often overlooked, nutrient cycle.', u'Sulfur, iron, and micronutrients also cycle through the system, entering as food and exiting as waste.', u'Appropriate handling of the nitrogen cycle, along with supplying an adequately balanced food supply and considered biological loading, is enough to keep these other nutrient cycles in approximate equilibrium.', u'An aquarium must be maintained regularly to ensure that the fish are kept healthy.', u'Daily maintenance consists of checking the fish for signs of stress and disease.', u'Also, aquarists must make sure that the water has a good quality and it is not cloudy or foamy and the temperature of the water is appropriate for the particular species of fish that live in the aquarium.', u'Typical weekly maintenance includes changing around 10-20% of the water while cleaning the gravel, or other substrate if the aquarium has one.', u'A good habit is to remove the water being replaced by "vacuuming" the gravel with suitable implements, as this will eliminate uneaten foods and other residues that settle on the substrate.', u'In many areas tap water is not considered to be safe for fish to live in because it contains chemicals that harm the fish.', u'Tap water from those areas must be treated with a suitable water conditioner, such as a product which removes chlorine and chloramine and neutralises any heavy metals present.', u'The water conditions must be checked both in the tank and in the replacement water, to make sure they are suitable for the species of fish kept.', u'=== Water conditions ===\nThe solute content of water is perhaps the most important aspect of water conditions, as total dissolved solids and other constituents dramatically impact basic water chemistry, and therefore how organisms interact with their environment.', u'Salt content, or salinity, is the most basic measure of water conditions.', u'An aquarium may have freshwater (salinity below 500 parts per million), simulating a lake or river environment; brackish water (a salt level of 500 to 30,000 PPM), simulating environments lying between fresh and salt, such as estuaries; and salt water or seawater (a salt level of 30,000 to 40,000 PPM), simulating an ocean environment.', u'Rarely, higher salt concentrations are maintained in specialized tanks for raising brine organisms.', u'Saltwater is typically alkaline, while the pH (alkalinity or acidicity) of fresh water varies more.', u'Hardness measures overall dissolved mineral content; hard or soft water may be preferred.', u'Hard water is usually alkaline, while soft water is usually neutral to acidic.', u'Dissolved organic content and dissolved gases content are also important factors.', u'Home aquarists typically use tap water supplied through their local water supply network to fill their tanks.', u'Straight tap water cannot be used in localities that pipe chlorinated water.', u'In the past, it was possible to "condition" the water by simply letting the water stand for a day or two, which allows the chlorine time to dissipate.', u'However, chloramine is now used more often and does not leave the water as readily.', u'Additives formulated to remove chlorine or chloramine are often all that is needed to make the water ready for aquarium use.', u'Brackish or saltwater aquaria require the addition of a commercially available mixture of salts and other minerals.', u"Some aquarists modify water's alkalinity, hardness, or dissolved content of organics and gases, before adding it to their aquaria.", u'This can be accomplished by additives, such as sodium bicarbonate, to raise pH.', u'Some aquarists filter or purify their water through deionization or reverse osmosis prior to using it.', u'In contrast, public aquaria with large water needs often locate themselves near a natural water source (such as a river, lake, or ocean) to reduce the level of treatment.', u'Some hobbyists use an algae scrubber to filter the water naturally.', u'Water temperature determines the two most basic aquarium classifications: tropical versus cold water.', u'Most fish and plant species tolerate only a limited temperature range; tropical aquaria, with an average temperature of about 25 \xb0C (77 \xb0F), are much more common.', u'Cold water aquaria are for fish that are better suited to a cooler environment.', u'More important than the range is consistency; most organisms are not accustomed to sudden changes in temperatures, which can cause shock and lead to disease.', u'Water temperature can be regulated with a thermostat and heater (or cooler).', u'Water movement can also be important in simulating a natural ecosystem.', u"Aquarists may prefer anything from still water up to swift currents, depending on the aquarium's inhabitants.", u'Water movement can be controlled via aeration from air pumps, powerheads, and careful design of internal water flow (such as location of filtration system points of inflow and outflow).', u"=== Nitrogen cycle ===\n\nOf primary concern to the aquarist is management of the waste produced by an aquarium's inhabitants.", u'Fish, invertebrates, fungi, and some bacteria excrete nitrogen waste in the form of ammonia (which converts to ammonium, in acidic water) and must then either pass through the nitrogen cycle or be removed by passing through zeolite.', u'Ammonia is also produced through the decomposition of plant and animal matter, including fecal matter and other detritus.', u'Nitrogen waste products become toxic to fish and other aquarium inhabitants at high concentrations.', u'In the wild, the vast amount of water surrounding the fish dilutes ammonia and other waste materials.', u'When fish are put into an aquarium, waste can quickly reach toxic concentrations in the enclosed environment unless the tank is cycled to remove waste.', u'==== The process ====\nA well-balanced tank contains organisms that are able to metabolize the waste products of other aquarium residents.', u'This process is known in the aquarium hobby as the nitrogen cycle.', u'Bacteria known as nitrifiers (genus Nitrosomonas) metabolize nitrogen waste.', u'Nitrifying bacteria capture ammonia from the water and metabolize it to produce nitrite.', u'Nitrite is toxic to fish in high concentrations.', u'Another type of bacteria (genus Nitrospira) converts nitrite into nitrate, a less toxic substance.', u'(Nitrobacter bacteria were previously believed to fill this role.', u'While biologically they could theoretically fill the same niche as Nitrospira, it has recently been found that Nitrobacter are not present in detectable levels in established aquaria, while Nitrospira are plentiful.)', u'However, commercial products sold as kits to "jump start" the nitrogen cycle often still contain Nitrobacter.', u'In addition to bacteria, aquatic plants also eliminate nitrogen waste by metabolizing ammonia and nitrate.', u'When plants metabolize nitrogen compounds, they remove nitrogen from the water by using it to build biomass that decays more slowly than ammonia-driven plankton already dissolved in the water.', u'==== Maintaining the nitrogen cycle ====\n\nWhat hobbyists call the nitrogen cycle is only a portion of the complete cycle: nitrogen must be added to the system (usually through food provided to the tank inhabitants), and nitrates accumulate in the water at the end of the process, or become bound in the biomass of plants.', u'The aquarium keeper must remove water once nitrate concentrations grow, or remove plants which have grown from the nitrates.', u'Hobbyist aquaria often do not have sufficient bacteria populations to adequately denitrify waste.', u'This problem is most often addressed through two filtration solutions: Activated carbon filters absorb nitrogen compounds and other toxins, while biological filters provide a medium designed to enhance bacterial colonization.', u'Activated carbon and other substances, such as ammonia absorbing resins, stop working when their pores fill, so these components have to be replaced regularly.', u'New aquaria often have problems associated with the nitrogen cycle due to insufficient beneficial bacteria.', u'Therefore, fresh water has to be matured before stocking them with fish.', u'There are three basic approaches to this: the "fishless cycle", the "silent cycle" and "slow growth".', u'In a fishless cycle, small amounts of ammonia are added to an unpopulated tank to feed the bacteria.', u'During this process, ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels are tested to monitor progress.', u'The "silent" cycle is basically nothing more than densely stocking the aquarium with fast-growing aquatic plants and relying on them to consume the nitrogen, allowing the necessary bacterial populations time to develop.', u'According to anecdotal reports, the plants can consume nitrogenous waste so efficiently that ammonia and nitrite level spikes seen in more traditional cycling methods are greatly reduced or disappear.', u'"Slow growth" entails slowly increasing the population of fish over a period of 6 to 8 weeks, giving bacteria colonies time to grow and stabilize with the increase in fish waste.', u'This method is usually done with a small starter population of hardier fish which can survive the ammonia and nitrite spikes, whether they are intended to be permanent residents or to be traded out later for the desired occupants.', u'The largest bacterial populations are found in the filter, where is high water flow and plentiful surface available for their growth, so effective and efficient filtration is vital.', u'Sometimes, a vigorous cleaning of the filter is enough to seriously disturb the biological balance of an aquarium.', u'Therefore, it is recommended to rinse mechanical filters in an outside bucket of aquarium water to dislodge organic materials that contribute to nitrate problems, while preserving bacteria populations.', u'Another safe practice consists of cleaning only half of the filter media during each service, or using two filters, only one of which is cleaned at a time.', u'=== Biological load ===\n\nThe biological load, or bioload, is a measure of the burden placed on the aquarium ecosystem by its inhabitants.', u'High biological loading presents a more complicated tank ecology, which in turn means that equilibrium is easier to upset.', u'Several fundamental constraints on biological loading depend on aquarium size.', u"The water's surface area limits oxygen intake.", u'The bacteria population depends on the physical space they have available to colonize.', u'Physically, only a limited size and number of plants and animals can fit into an aquarium while still providing room for movement.', u'Biologically, biological loading refers to the rate of biological decay in proportion to tank volume.', u'Adding plants to an aquarium will sometimes help greatly with taking up fish waste as plant nutrients.', u'Although an aquarium can be overloaded with fish, an excess of plants is unlikely to cause harm.', u'Decaying plant material, such as decaying plant leaves, can add these nutrients back into the aquarium if not promptly removed.', u"The bioload is processed by the aquarium's biofilter filtration system.", u'==== Calculating capacity ====\nLimiting factors include the oxygen availability and filtration processing.', u'Aquarists have rules of thumb to estimate the number of fish that can be kept in an aquarium.', u'The examples below are for small freshwater fish; larger freshwater fishes and most marine fishes need much more generous allowances.', u'3 cm of adult fish length per 4 litres of water (i.e., a 6 cm-long fish would need about 8 litres of water).', u'1 cm of adult fish length per 30 square centimetres of surface area.', u'1 inch of adult fish length per US gallon of water.', u'1 inch of adult fish length per 12 square inches of surface area.', u'Experienced aquarists warn against applying these rules too strictly because they do not consider other important issues such as growth rate, activity level, social behaviour, filtration capacity, total biomass of plant life, and so on.', u'It is better to apply the overall mass and size of a fish per gallon of water, than simply the length.', u'This is because fish of different sizes produce quite differing amounts of waste.', u'Establishing maximum capacity is often a matter of slowly adding fish and monitoring water quality over time, following a trial and error approach.', u'==== Other factors affecting capacity ====\nOne variable is differences between fish.', u'Smaller fish consume more oxygen per gram of body weight than larger fish.', u'Labyrinth fish can breathe atmospheric oxygen and do not need as much surface area (however, some of these fish are territorial, and do not appreciate crowding).', u'Barbs also require more surface area than tetras of comparable size.', u'Oxygen exchange at the surface is an important constraint, and thus the surface area of the aquarium matters.', u'Some aquarists claim that a deeper aquarium holds no more fish than a shallower aquarium with the same surface area.', u'The capacity can be improved by surface movement and water circulation such as through aeration, which not only improves oxygen exchange, but also waste decomposition rates.', u'Waste density is another variable.', u'Decomposition in solution consumes oxygen.', u'Oxygen dissolves less readily in warmer water; this is a double-edged sword since warmer temperatures make fish more active, so they consume more oxygen.', u'In addition to bioload/chemical considerations, aquarists also consider the mutual compatibility of the fish.', u'For instance, predatory fish are usually not kept with small, passive species, and territorial fish are often unsuitable tankmates for shoaling species.', u'Furthermore, fish tend to fare better if given tanks conducive to their size.', u'That is, large fish need large tanks and small fish can do well in smaller tanks.', u'Lastly, the tank can become overcrowded without being overstocked.', u'In other words, the aquarium can be suitable with regard to filtration capacity, oxygen load, and water, yet still be so crowded that the inhabitants are uncomfortable.', u'For planted freshwater aquariums, it is also important to maintain a balance between the duration and quality of light, the amount of plants, CO2 and nutrients.', u'For a given amount of light, if there is insufficient number of plants or insufficient CO2 to support the growth of those plants, so as to consume all the nutrients in the tank, the result would be algae growth.', u'While there are fishes and invertebrates that could be introduced in the tank to clean up this algae, the ideal solution would be to find the optimal balance between the above-mentioned factors.', u'Supplemental CO2 can be provided, whose quantity has to be carefully regulated, as too much CO2 may harm the fishes,\n\n\n== Aquarium classifications ==\n\nFrom the outdoor ponds and glass jars of antiquity, modern aquaria have evolved into a wide range of specialized systems.', u'Individual aquaria can vary in size from a small bowl large enough for only a single small fish, to the huge public aquaria that can simulate entire marine ecosystems.', u'One way to classify aquaria is by salinity.', u'Freshwater aquaria are the most popular due to their lower cost.', u'More expensive and complex equipment is required to set up and maintain marine aquaria.', u'Marine aquaria frequently feature a diverse range of invertebrates in addition to species of fish.', u'Brackish water aquaria combine elements of both marine and freshwater fishkeeping.', u'Fish kept in brackish water aquaria generally come from habitats with varying salinity, such as mangrove swamps and estuaries.', u'Subtypes exist within these types, such as the reef aquarium, a typically smaller marine aquarium that houses coral.', u'Another classification is by temperature range.', u'Many aquarists choose a tropical aquarium because tropical fish tend to be more colorful.', u'However, the coldwater aquarium is also popular, which is mainly restricted to goldfish, but can include fish from temperate areas worldwide and native fish keeping.', u'Aquaria may be grouped by their species selection.', u'The community tank is the most common today, where several non-aggressive species live peacefully.', u'In these aquaria, the fish, invertebrates, and plants probably do not originate from the same geographic region, but tolerate similar water conditions.', u'Aggressive tanks, in contrast, house a limited number of species that can be aggressive toward other fish, or are able to withstand aggression well.', u'Most marine tanks and tanks housing cichlids have to take the aggressiveness of the desired species into account when stocking.', u"Specimen tanks usually only house one fish species, along with plants, perhaps ones found in the fishes' natural environment and decorations simulating a natural ecosystem.", u'This type is useful for fish that cannot coexist with other fish, such as the electric eel, as an extreme example.', u'Some tanks of this sort are used simply to house adults for breeding.', u'Ecotype, ecotope, or biotope aquaria is another type based on species selection.', u'In it, an aquarist attempts to simulate a specific natural ecosystem, assembling fish, invertebrate species, plants, decorations and water conditions all found in that ecosystem.', u'These biotope aquaria are the most sophisticated hobby aquaria; public aquaria use this approach whenever possible.', u'This approach best simulates the experience of observing in the wild.', u"It typically serves as the healthiest possible artificial environment for the tank's occupants.", u'== Public aquaria ==\n\nMost public aquarium facilities feature a number of smaller aquaria, as well those too large for home aquarists.', u'The largest tanks hold millions of gallons of water and can house large species, including sharks or beluga whales.', u'Dolphinaria are specifically for dolphins.', u'Aquatic and semiaquatic animals, including otters and penguins, may also be kept by public aquaria.', u'Public aquaria may also be included in larger establishments such as a marine mammal park or a marine park.', u'== Virtual aquariums ==\nA virtual aquarium is a computer program which uses 3D graphics to reproduce an aquarium on a personal computer.', u'The swimming fish are rendered in real time, while the background of the tank is usually static.', u'Objects on the floor of the tank may be mapped in simple planes so that the fish may appear to swim both in front and behind them, but a relatively simple 3D map of the general shape of such objects may be used to allow the light and ripples on the surface of the water to cast realistic shadows.', u'Bubbles and water noises are common for virtual aquariums, which are often used as screensavers.', u'The number of each type of fish can usually be selected, often including other animals like starfish, jellyfish, seahorses, and even sea turtles.', u'Most companies that produce virtual aquarium software also offer other types of fish for sale via Internet download.', u'Other objects found in an aquarium can also be added and rearranged on some software, like treasure chests and giant clams that open and close with air bubbles, or a bobbing diver.', u'There are also usually features that allow the user to tap on the glass or put food in the top, both of which the fish will react to.', u'Some also have the ability to allow the user to edit fish and other objects to create new varieties.', u'== See also

record, DiMaggio showed more interest, saying, "At the start I didn\'t think much about it... but naturally I\'d like to get the record since I am this close."', u"On June 29, 1941, DiMaggio doubled in the first game of a doubleheader against the Washington Senators at Griffith Stadium to tie Sisler's record, and then singled in the nightcap to extend his streak to 42.", u'A Yankee Stadium crowd of 52,832 fans watched DiMaggio tie the all-time hitting streak record (44 games, Wee Willie Keeler in 1897) on July 1.', u"The next day against the Boston Red Sox, he homered into Yankee Stadium's left field stands to extend his streak to 45, setting a new record.", u'DiMaggio recorded 67 hits in 179 at-bats during the first 45 games of his streak, while Keeler recorded 88 hits in 201 at-bats.', u"DiMaggio continued hitting after breaking Keeler's record, reaching 50 straight games on July 11 against the St. Louis Browns.", u"On July 17 at Cleveland Stadium, DiMaggio's streak was finally snapped at 56 games, thanks in part to two backhand stops by Indians third baseman Ken Keltner.", u'DiMaggio batted .408 during the streak, with 15 home runs and 55 RBI.', u'The day after the streak ended, DiMaggio started another streak that lasted 16 games.', u'The distinction of hitting safely in 72 of 73 games is also a record.', u'The closest anyone has come to equaling DiMaggio since 1941 is Pete Rose, who hit safely in 44 straight games in 1978.', u'During the streak, DiMaggio played in seven doubleheaders.', u"The Yankees' record during the streak was 41\u201313\u20132.", u"Some consider DiMaggio's streak a uniquely outstanding and unbreakable record, and a statistical near-impossibility.", u'Nobel Prize-winning physicist and sabermetrician Edward Mills Purcell calculated that, to have the likelihood of a hitting streak of 50 games occurring in the history of baseball up to the late 1980s be greater than 50%, fifty-two .350 lifetime hitters would have to have existed instead of the actual three (Ty Cobb, Rogers Hornsby, and Shoeless Joe Jackson).', u'His Harvard colleague Stephen Jay Gould, citing Purcell\'s work, called DiMaggio\'s 56-game achievement "the most extraordinary thing that ever happened in American sports".', u'Samuel Arbesman and Steven Strogatz of Cornell University disagree; they conducted 10,000 computer simulations of Major League Baseball from 1871 to 2005, 42% of which produced streaks as long or longer, with record streaks ranging from 39 to 109 games and typical record streaks between 50 and 64 games.', u'== Wartime ==\nDiMaggio enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces on February 17, 1943, rising to the rank of sergeant.', u'He was stationed at Santa Ana, California, Hawaii, and Atlantic City, New Jersey, as a physical education instructor.', u'He was released on medical discharge in September 1945, due to chronic stomach ulcers.', u"Other than now being paid $21 a month, DiMaggio's service was as comfortable as a soldier's life could be.", u'He spent most of his career playing for baseball teams and in exhibition games against fellow Major Leaguers and minor league players, and superiors gave him special privileges due to his prewar fame.', u'DiMaggio ate so well from an athlete-only diet that he gained 10 pounds, and while in Hawaii he and other players mostly tanned on the beach and drank.', u'Embarrassed by his lifestyle, DiMaggio demanded combat duty in 1943, but was turned down.', u'=== Parents as "enemy aliens" ===\nGiuseppe and Rosalia DiMaggio were among the thousands of German, Japanese and Italian immigrants classified as "enemy aliens" by the government after Pearl Harbor was bombed by Japan.', u'They carried photo ID booklets at all times, and were not allowed to travel outside a five-mile radius from their home without a permit.', u'Giuseppe was barred from the San Francisco Bay, where he had fished for decades, and his boat was seized.', u'Rosalia became an American citizen in 1944, followed by Giuseppe in 1945.', u'== Married life ==\n\n\n=== Dorothy Arnold ===\nIn January 1937, DiMaggio met actress Dorothy Arnold on the set of Manhattan Merry-Go-Round, in which he had a minor role, and she was an extra.', u"They married at San Francisco's St. Peter and Paul Church on November 19, 1939, as 20,000 well-wishers jammed the streets.", u'Their son, Joseph Paul DiMaggio III, was born at Doctors Hospital on October 23, 1941.', u'The couple divorced in 1944.', u'=== Marilyn Monroe ===\n\nAccording to her autobiography, Marilyn Monroe originally did not want to meet DiMaggio, fearing that he was a stereotypical arrogant athlete.', u'They eloped at San Francisco City Hall on January 14, 1954.', u"An incident between the couple is supposed to have occurred immediately after the skirt-blowing scene in The Seven Year Itch that was filmed on September 14, 1954, in front of Manhattan's Trans-Lux 52nd Street Theater.", u"Then-20th Century Fox's East Coast correspondent Bill Kobrin told the Palm Springs Desert Sun that it was director Billy Wilder's idea to turn the shoot into a media circus.", u'The couple then had a "yelling battle" in the theater lobby.', u'A month later, she contracted the services of celebrity attorney Jerry Giesler and filed for divorce on grounds of mental cruelty nine months after the wedding.', u'After the failure of their marriage, DiMaggio had undergone therapy, stopped drinking alcohol and expanded his interests beyond baseball: he and Monroe read poetry together in their later years.', u'On August 1, 1956, an International News wire photo of DiMaggio with Lee Meriwether gave rise to speculation that the couple was engaged, but Cramer wrote that it was a rumor started by Walter Winchell.', u'Monroe biographer Donald Spoto claimed that DiMaggio was "very close to marrying" 1957 Miss America Marian McKnight, who won the crown with a Marilyn Monroe act, but McKnight denied it.', u'He was also linked to Liz Renay, Cleo Moore, Rita Gam, Marlene Dietrich, and Gloria DeHaven during this period, and to Elizabeth Ray and Morgan Fairchild years later, but he never publicly confirmed any involvement with any woman.', u"DiMaggio re-entered Monroe's life as her marriage to Arthur Miller was ending.", u'On February 10, 1961, he secured her release from Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic.', u'She joined him in Florida where he was a batting coach for the Yankees.', u'Their "just friends" claim did not stop remarriage rumors from flying.', u'Reporters staked out her Manhattan apartment building.', u'Bob Hope "dedicated" Best Song nominee "The Second Time Around" to them at the 33rd Academy Awards.', u"According to Maury Allen's biography, DiMaggio was alarmed at how Monroe had fallen in with people he felt were detrimental to her well-being.", u'Val Monette, owner of a military post-exchange supply company, told Allen that DiMaggio left his employ on August 1, 1962, because he had decided to ask Monroe to remarry him.', u"She was found dead in her Brentwood, Los Angeles, home on August 5 after housekeeper Eunice Murray telephoned Monroe's psychiatrist, Dr. Ralph Greenson.", u"DiMaggio's son had spoken to Monroe on the phone the night of her death and claimed that she seemed fine.", u'Her death was deemed a probable suicide by "Coroner to the Stars" Thomas Noguchi, but has been the subject of numerous conspiracy theories.', u"Devastated, DiMaggio claimed her body and arranged for her funeral at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery, barring Hollywood's elite.", u'He had a half-dozen red roses delivered three times a week to her crypt for 20 years.', u'He refused to talk about her publicly or otherwise exploit their relationship.', u'He never married again.', u'When he died in 1999, his last words were "I\'ll finally get to see Marilyn."', u'== Advertising ==\nIn the 1970s, DiMaggio became a spokesman for Mr. Coffee and would be the face of the electric, drip coffee makers for over 20 years.', u'Vincent Marotta, the CEO of North American Systems, which manufactured Mr. Coffee at the time, recruited DiMaggio for the advertising campaign.', u"DiMaggio's spots proved successful with consumers.", u'In a 2007 interview with the Columbus Dispatch, Marotta joked that "millions of kids grew up thinking Joe DiMaggio was a famous appliance salesman."', u'Despite his commercials for Mr. Coffee, Joe DiMaggio rarely drank coffee due to ulcers.', u'However, when he did drink coffee, DiMaggio preferred Sanka instant coffee, rather than the coffee brewed by Mr. Coffee machines.', u'In 1972, DiMaggio became a spokesman for The Bowery Savings Bank.', u'With the exception of a five-year hiatus in the 1980s, DiMaggio regularly made commercials for the financial institution until 1992.', u'== Death ==\n\nDiMaggio, a heavy smoker for much of his adult life, was admitted to Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Florida, on October 12, 1998, for lung cancer surgery and remained there for 99 days.', u'He returned to his Hollywood, Florida home on January 19, 1999, where he died on March 8.', u'Joe DiMaggio\'s final words were: "I finally get to see Marilyn", referring to his former wife Marilyn Monroe.', u"DiMaggio's funeral was held on March 11, 1999, at Sts.", u'Peter and Paul Roman Catholic Church in San Francisco; he was interred at Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, California.', u"DiMaggio's son died the following August at age 57.", u'A highway lining the Hudson River in Manhattan, New York from the end of Lower Manhattan is named the Joe DiMaggio Highway.', u'It runs for the entire way.', u'== Sports legacy ==\nAt his death, The New York Times called DiMaggio\'s 1941 56-game hitting streak "perhaps the most enduring record in sports".', u'In an article in 1976 in Esquire magazine, sportswriter Harry Stein published an "All Time All-Star Argument Starter", consisting of five ethnic baseball teams.', u"Joe DiMaggio was the center fielder on Stein's Italian team.", u"On September 17, 1992, the doors were opened at Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital at Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Florida, for which he raised over $4,000,000.", u'On April 13, 1998, DiMaggio was given the Sports Legend Award at the 13th annual American Sportscasters Association Hall of Fame Awards Dinner in New York City.',

{'sentences': [u'Intel Corporation (also known as Intel) [stylized as intel] is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California (colloquially referred to as "Silicon Valley") that was founded by Gordon Moore (of Moore\'s Law fame) and Robert Noyce.', u"It and AMD are the world's largest and highest valued semiconductor chip makers based on revenue., and is the inventor of the x86 series of microprocessors, the processors found in most personal computers (PCs).", u'Intel supplies processors for computer system manufacturers such as Apple, Inc., Lenovo (formerly IBM), Hewlett Packard, Inc. and Dell.', u'Intel also manufactures motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers and integrated circuits, flash memory, graphics chips, embedded processors and other devices related to communications and computing.', u'Intel Corporation was founded on July 18, 1968 by semiconductor pioneers Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, and widely associated with the executive leadership and vision of Andrew Grove.', u"The company's name was conceived as portmanteau of the words integrated and electronics.", u'The fact that "intel" is the term for intelligence information also made the name appropriate.', u'Intel was an early developer of SRAM and DRAM memory chips, which represented the majority of its business until 1981.', u"Although Intel created the world's first commercial microprocessor chip in 1971, it was not until the success of the personal computer (PC) that this became its primary business.", u'During the 1990s, Intel invested heavily in new microprocessor designs fostering the rapid growth of the computer industry.', u'During this period Intel became the dominant supplier of microprocessors for PCs, and was known for aggressive and anti-competitive tactics in defense of its market position, particularly against Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), as well as a struggle with Microsoft for control over the direction of the PC industry.', u"Intel was placed at #56 on the 2015 rankings of the world's most valuable brands published by Millward Brown Optimor.", u'The Open Source Technology Center at Intel hosts PowerTOP and LatencyTOP, and supports other open-source projects such as Wayland, Intel Array Building Blocks, and Threading Building Blocks (TBB), and Xen.', u'== Current operations ==\n\n\n=== Operating segments ===\nIntel Computing Group \u2013  58% of 2015 revenues \u2013  produces hardware components used in desktop and notebook computers.', u'Data Center Group \u2013  29% of 2015 revenues \u2013  produces hardware components used in server, network, and storage platforms.', u'Internet of Things Group \u2013  4% of 2015 revenues \u2013  offers platforms designed for retail, transportation, industrial, buildings and home use.', u'Software and Services \u2013  4% of 2015 revenues \u2013  produces software, particularly security and antivirus software.', u'Other \u2013  5% of 2015 revenues \u2013  primarily the Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group and the New Devices Group.', u"=== Top customers ===\nIn 2015, HP Inc. and HP Enterprise collectively accounted for 18% of the company's revenue, Dell for 15%, and Lenovo for 13%.", u'=== Market share ===\n\n\n==== Market share in early 2011 ====\nAccording to IDC, while Intel enjoyed the biggest market share in both the overall worldwide PC microprocessor market (79.3%) and the mobile PC microprocessor (84.4%) in the second quarter of 2011, the numbers decreased by 1.5% and 1.9% compared to the first quarter of 2011.', u'==== Historical market share ====\nIn the 1980s, Intel was among the top ten sellers of semiconductors (10th in 1987) in the world.', u'In 1991, Intel became the biggest chip maker by revenue and has held the position ever since.', u'Other top semiconductor companies include TSMC, Advanced Micro Devices, Samsung, Texas Instruments, Toshiba and STMicroelectronics.', u'==== Major competitors ====\nCompetitors in PC chip sets include Advanced Micro Devices, VIA Technologies, Silicon Integrated Systems, and Nvidia.', u"Intel's competitors in networking include NXP Semiconductors, Infineon, Broadcom Limited, Marvell Technology Group and Applied Micro Circuits Corporation, and competitors in flash memory include Spansion, Samsung, Qimonda, Toshiba, STMicroelectronics, and SK Hynix.", u"The only major competitor in the x86 processor market is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), with which Intel has had full cross-licensing agreements since 1976: each partner can use the other's patented technological innovations without charge after a certain time.", u'However, the cross-licensing agreement is canceled in the event of an AMD bankruptcy or takeover.', u'Some smaller competitors such as VIA Technologies produce low-power x86 processors for small factor computers and portable equipment.', u'However, the advent of such mobile computing devices, in particular, smartphones, has in recent years led to a decline in PC sales.', u"Since over 95% of the world's smartphones currently use processors designed by ARM Holdings, ARM has become a major competitor for Intel's processor market.", u'ARM is also planning to make inroads into the PC and server market.', u'Intel has been involved in several disputes regarding violation of antitrust laws, which are noted below.', u'== Corporate history ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nIntel was founded in Mountain View, California in 1968 by Gordon E. Moore (of "Moore\'s Law" fame), a chemist, and Robert Noyce, a physicist and co-inventor of the integrated circuit.', u'Arthur Rock (investor and venture capitalist) helped them find investors, while Max Palevsky was on the board from an early stage.', u'Moore and Noyce had left Fairchild Semiconductor to found Intel.', u'Rock was not an employee, but he was an investor and was chairman of the board.', u'The total initial investment in Intel was $2.5 million convertible debentures and $10,000 from Rock.', u'Just 2 years later, Intel became a public company via an initial public offering (IPO), raising $6.8 million ($23.50 per share).', u"Intel's third employee was Andy Grove, a chemical engineer, who later ran the company through much of the 1980s and the high-growth 1990s.", u'In deciding on a name, Moore and Noyce quickly rejected "Moore Noyce", homophone for "more noise" \u2013 an ill-suited name for an electronics company, since noise in electronics is usually very undesirable and typically associated with bad interference.', u'Instead they used the name NM Electronics before renaming their company Integrated Electronics or "Intel" for short.', u'Since "Intel" was already trademarked by the hotel chain Intelco, they had to buy the rights for the name.', u'=== Early history ===\nAt its founding, Intel was distinguished by its ability to make semiconductors.', u'Its first product, in 1969, was the 3101 Schottky TTL bipolar 64-bit static random-access memory (SRAM), which was nearly twice as fast as earlier Schottky diode implementations by Fairchild and the Electrotechnical Laboratory in Tsukuba, Japan.', u'In the same year Intel also produced the 3301 Schottky bipolar 1024-bit read-only memory (ROM) and the first commercial metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) silicon gate SRAM chip, the 256-bit 1101.', u"Intel's business grew during the 1970s as it expanded and improved its manufacturing processes and produced a wider range of products, still dominated by various memory devices.", u'While Intel created the first commercially available microprocessor (Intel 4004) in 1971 and one of the first microcomputers in 1972, by the early 1980s its business was dominated by dynamic random-access memory chips.', u'However, increased competition from Japanese semiconductor manufacturers had, by 1983, dramatically reduced the profitability of this market.', u"The growing success of the IBM personal computer, based on an Intel microprocessor, was among factors that convinced Gordon Moore (CEO since 1975) to shift the company's focus to microprocessors, and to change fundamental aspects of that business model.", u"Moore's decision to sole-source Intel's 386 chip played into the company's continuing success.", u"By the end of the 1980s, buoyed by its fortuitous position as microprocessor supplier to IBM and IBM's competitors within the rapidly growing personal computer market, Intel embarked on a 10-year period of unprecedented growth as the primary (and most profitable) hardware supplier to the PC industry, part of the winning 'Wintel' combination.", u'Moore handed over to Andy Grove in 1987.', u'By launching its Intel Inside marketing campaign in 1991, Intel was able to associate brand loyalty with consumer selection, so that by the end of the 1990s, its line of Pentium processors had become a household name.', u'=== Slowing demand and challenges to dominance in 2000 ===\nAfter 2000, growth in demand for high-end microprocessors slowed.', u"Competitors, notably AMD (Intel's largest competitor in its primary x86 architecture market), garnered significant market share, initially in low-end and mid-range processors but ultimately across the product range, and Intel's dominant position in its core market was greatly reduced.", u"In the early 2000s then-CEO Craig Barrett attempted to diversify the company's business beyond semiconductors, but few of these activities were ultimately successful.", u'=== Litigation ===\nIntel had also for a number of years been embroiled in litigation.', u'US law did not initially recognize intellectual property rights related to microprocessor topology (circuit layouts), until the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984, a law sought by Intel and the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA).', u'During the late 1980s and 1990s (after this law was passed), Intel also sued companies that tried to develop competitor chips to the 80386 CPU.', u'The lawsuits were noted to significantly burden the competition with legal bills, even if Intel lost the suits.', u'Antitrust allegations had been simmering since the early 1990s and had been the cause of one lawsuit against Intel in 1991.', u'In 2004 and 2005, AMD brought further claims against Intel related to unfair competition.', u'=== Regaining of momentum (2005\u20132007) ===\nIn 2005, CEO Paul Otellini reorganized the company to refocus its core processor and chipset business on platforms (enterprise, digital home, digital health, and mobility).', u'In 2007, Intel unveiled its Core microarchitecture to widespread critical acclaim; the product range was perceived as an exceptional leap in processor performance that at a stroke regained much of its leadership of the field.', u'In 2008, Intel had another "tick," when it introduced the Penryn microarchitecture, which was 45 nm.', u'Later that year, Intel released a processor with the Nehalem architecture.', u'Nehalem had positive reviews.', u"=== Sale of XScale processor business (2006) ===\nOn June 27, 2006, the sale of Intel's XScale assets was announced.", u'Intel agreed to sell the XScale processor business to Marvell Technology Group for an estimated $600 million and the assumption of unspecified liabilities.', u'The move was intended to permit Intel to focus its resources on its core x86 and server businesses, and the acquisition completed on November 9, 2006.', u'=== Acquisitions (2010\u20132016) ===\nIn 2010, Intel purchased McAfee, a manufacturer of computer security technology for $7.68 billion.', u"As a condition for regulatory approval of the transaction, Intel agreed to provide rival security firms with all necessary information that would allow their products to use Intel's chips and personal computers.", u'After the acquisition, Intel had about 90,000 employees, including about 12,000 software engineers.', u'In September 2016, Intel sold a majority stake in its computer-security unit to TPG, reversing the five-year-old McAfee acquisition.', u"On August 30, 2010, Intel and Infineon Technologies announced that Intel would acquire Infineon's Wireless Solutions business.", u"Intel planned to use Infineon's technology in laptops, smart phones, netbooks, tablets and embedded computers in consumer products, eventually integrating its wireless modem into Intel's silicon chips.", u'In March 2011, Intel bought most of the assets of Cairo-based SySDSoft.', u'In July 2011, Intel announced that it had agreed to acquire Fulcrum Microsystems Inc., a company specializing in network switches.', u'The company used to be included on the EE Times list of 60 Emerging Startups.', u'On October 1, 2011, Intel reached a deal to acquire Telmap, an Israeli-based navigation software company.', u'The purchase price was not disclosed, but Israeli media reported values around $300 million to $350 million.', u'In July 2012, Intel Corporation agreed to buy 10 percent shares of ASML Holding NV for $2.1 billion and another $1 billon for 5 percent shares that need shareholder approval to fund relevant research and development efforts, as part of a EUR3.3 billion ($4.1 billion) deal to accelerate the development of 450-millimeter wafer technology and extreme ultra-violet lithography by as much as two years.', u'In July 2013, Intel confirmed the acquisition of Omek Interactive, an Israeli company that makes technology for gesture-based interfaces, without disclosing the monetary value of the deal.', u'An official statement from Intel read: "The acquisition of Omek Interactive will help increase Intel\'s capabilities in the delivery of more immersive perceptual computing experiences."', u'One report estimated the value of the acquisition between US$30 million and $50 million.', u'The acquisition of a Spanish natural language recognition startup named Indisys was announced on September 13, 2013.', u'The terms of the deal were not disclosed but an email from an Intel representative stated: "Intel has acquired Indisys, a privately held company based in Seville, Spain.', u'The majority of Indisys employees joined Intel.', u'We signed the agreement to acquire the company on May 31 and the deal has been completed."', u'Indysis explains that its artificial intelligence (AI) technology "is a human image, which converses fluently and with common sense in multiple languages and also works in different platforms."', u'In December 2014, Intel bought PasswordBox.', u'In January 2015, Intel purchased a 30% stake in Vuzix, a smart glasses manufacturer.', u'The deal was worth $24.8 million.', u'In February 2015, Intel announced its agreement to purchase German network chipmaker Lantiq, to aid in its expansion of its range of chips in devices with Internet connection capability.', u'In June 2015, Intel announced its agreement to purchase FPGA design company Altera for $16.7 billion, in its largest acquisition to date.', u'The acquisition completed in December 2015.', u'In October 2015, Intel bought cognitive computing company Saffron Technology for an undisclosed price.', u'In August 2016, Intel purchased deep-learning startup Nervana Systems for $350 Million.', u'== Acquisition table (2010\u20132016) ==\n\n\n=== Expansions (2008\u20132011) ===\nIn 2008, Intel spun off key assets of a solar startup business effort to form an independent company, SpectraWatt Inc.', u'In 2011, SpectraWatt filed for bankruptcy.', u'In February 2011, Intel began to build a new microprocessor manufacturing facility in Chandler, Arizona, completed in 2013 at a cost of $5 billion.', u'The building was never used.', u'The company produces three-quarters of its products in the United States, although three-quarters of its revenue comes from overseas.', u"In April 2011, Intel began a pilot project with ZTE Corporation to produce smartphones using the Intel Atom processor for China's domestic market.", u"In December 2011, Intel announced that it reorganized several of its business units into a new mobile and communications group be responsible for the company's smartphone, tablet and wireless efforts.", u'=== Opening up the foundries to other manufacturers (2013) ===\nFinding itself with excess fab capacity after the failure of the Ultrabook to gain market traction and with PC sales declining, in 2013 Intel reached a foundry agreement to produce chips for Altera using 14-nm process.', u"General Manager of Intel's custom foundry division Sunit Rikhi indicated that Intel would pursue further such deals in the future.", u'This was after poor sales of Windows 8 hardware caused a major retrenchment for most of the major semiconductor manufacturers, except for Qualcomm, which continued to see healthy purchases from its largest customer, Apple.', u"As of July 2013, five companies were using Intel's fabs via the Intel Custom Foundry division: Achronix, Tabula, Netronome, Microsemi, and Panasonic \u2013  most are field-programmable gate array (FPGA) makers, but Netronome designs network processors.", u'Only Achronix began shipping chips made by Intel using the 22-nm Tri-Gate process.', u'Several other customers also exist but were not announced at the time.', u'The Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI) was launched in October 2013 and Intel is part of the coalition of public and private organisations that also includes Facebook, Google, and Microsoft.', u'Led by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the A4AI seeks to make Internet access more affordable so that access is broadened in the developing world, where only 31% of people are online.', u"Google will help to decrease internet access prices so that they fall below the UN Broadband Commission's worldwide target of 5% of monthly income.", u"== Product and market history ==\n\n\n=== SRAMS and the microprocessor ===\nIntel's first products were shift register memory and random-access memory integrated circuits, and Intel grew to be a leader in the fiercely competitive DRAM, SRAM, and ROM markets throughout the 1970s.", u"Concurrently, Intel engineers Marcian Hoff, Federico Faggin, Stanley Mazor and Masatoshi Shima invented Intel's first microprocessor.", u"Originally developed for the Japanese company Busicom to replace a number of ASICs in a calculator already produced by Busicom, the Intel 4004 was introduced to the mass market on November 15, 1971, though the microprocessor did not become the core of Intel's business until the mid-1980s.", u"(Note: Intel is usually given credit with Texas Instruments for the almost-simultaneous invention of the microprocessor)\n\n\n=== From DRAM to microprocessors ===\nIn 1983, at the dawn of the personal computer era, Intel's profits came under increased pressure from Japanese memory-chip manufacturers, and then-president Andy Grove focused the company on microprocessors.", u'Grove described this transition in the book Only the Paranoid Survive.', u'A key element of his plan was the notion, then considered radical, of becoming the single source for successors to the popular 8086 microprocessor.', u'Until then, the manufacture of complex integrated circuits was not reliable enough for customers to depend on a single supplier, but Grove began producing processors in three geographically distinct factories, and ceased licensing the chip designs to competitors such as Zilog and AMD.', u'When the PC industry boomed in the late 1980s and 1990s, Intel was one of the primary beneficiaries.', u'=== Intel, x86 processors, and the IBM PC ===\n\nDespite the ultimate importance of the microprocessor, the 4004 and its successors the 8008 and the 8080 were never major revenue contributors at Intel.', u'As the next processor, the 8086 (and its variant the 8088) was completed in 1978, Intel embarked on a major marketing and sales campaign for that chip nicknamed "Operation Crush", and intended to win as many customers for the processor as possible.', u'One design win was the newly created IBM PC division, though the importance of this was not fully realized at the time.', u'IBM introduced its personal computer in 1981, and it was rapidly successful.', u'In 1982, Intel created the 80286 microprocessor, which, two years later, was used in the IBM PC/AT.', u'Compaq, the first IBM PC "clone" manufacturer, produced a desktop system based on the faster 80286 processor in 1985 and in 1986 quickly followed with the first 80386-based system, beating IBM and establishing a competitive market for PC-compatible systems and setting up Intel as a key component supplier.', u'In 1975, the company had started a project to develop a highly advanced 32-bit microprocessor, finally released in 1981 as the Intel iAPX 432.', u'The project was too ambitious and the processor was never able to meet its performance objectives, and it failed in the marketplace.', u'Intel extended the x86 architecture to 32 bits instead.', u'==== 386 microprocessor ====\nDuring this period Andrew Grove dramatically redirected the company, closing much of its DRAM business and directing resources to the microprocessor business.', u'Of perhaps greater importance was his decision to "single-source" the 386 microprocessor.', u'Prior to this, microprocessor manufacturing was in its infancy, and manufacturing problems frequently reduced or stopped production, interrupting supplies to customers.', u'To mitigate this risk, these customers typically insisted that multiple manufacturers produce chips they could use to ensure a consistent supply.', u'The 8080 and 8086-series microprocessors were produced by several companies, notably AMD.', u'Grove made the decision not to license the 386 design to other manufacturers, instead producing it in three geographically distinct factories: Santa Clara, California; Hillsboro, Oregon; and Chandler, a suburb of Phoenix, Arizona.', u'He convinced customers that this would ensure consistent delivery.', u"As the success of Compaq's Deskpro 386 established the 386 as the dominant CPU choice, Intel achieved a position of near-exclusive dominance as its supplier.", u'Profits from this funded rapid development of both higher-performance chip designs and higher-performance manufacturing capabilities, propelling Intel to a position of unquestioned leadership by the early 1990s.', u'==== 486, Pentium, and Itanium ====\nIntel introduced the 486 microprocessor in 1989, and in 1990 established a second design team, designing the processors code-named "P5" and "P6" in parallel and committing to a major new processor every two years, versus the four or more years such designs had taken.', u"Engineers Vinod Dham and Rajeev Chandrasekhar (Member of Parliament, India) were key figures on the core team that invented the 486 chip and later, Intel's signature Pentium chip.", u'The P5 was earlier known as "Operation Bicycle," referring to the cycles of the processor.', u'The P5 was introduced in 1993 as the Intel Pentium, substituting a registered trademark name for the former part number (numbers, such as 486, are hard to register as a trademark).', u'The P6 followed in 1995 as the Pentium Pro and improved into the Pentium II in 1997.', u'New architectures were developed alternately in Santa Clara, California and Hillsboro, Oregon.', u'The Santa Clara design team embarked in 1993 on a successor to the x86 architecture, codenamed "P7".', u'The first attempt was dropped a year later, but quickly revived in a cooperative program with Hewlett-Packard engineers, though Intel soon took over primary design responsibility.', u'The resulting implementation of the IA-64 64-bit architecture was the Itanium, finally introduced in June 2001.', u"The Itanium's performance running legacy x86 code did not meet expectations, and it failed to compete effectively with x86-64, which was AMD's 64-bit extensions to the original x86 architecture (Intel uses the name Intel 64, previously EM64T).", u'As of 2012, Intel continues to develop and deploy the Itanium; known planning continues into 2014.', u'The Hillsboro team designed the Willamette processors (initially code-named P68), which were marketed as the Pentium 4.', u'==== Pentium flaw ====\n\nIn June 1994, Intel engineers discovered a flaw in the floating-point math subsection of the P5 Pentium microprocessor.', u'Under certain data-dependent conditions, the low-order bits of the result of a floating-point division would be incorrect.', u'The error could compound in subsequent calculations.', u'Intel corrected the error in a future chip revision.', u'In October 1994, Thomas Nicely, Professor of Mathematics at Lynchburg College, independently discovered the bug.', u'He contacted Intel, but received no response.', u'On October 30, he posted a message on the Internet.', u'Word of the bug spread quickly and reached the industry press.', u'The bug was easy to replicate; a user could enter specific numbers into the calculator on the operating system.', u'Consequently, many users did not accept Intel\'s statements that the error was minor and "not even an erratum."', u'During Thanksgiving, in 1994, The New York Times ran a piece by journalist John Markoff spotlighting the error.', u'Intel changed its position and offered to replace every chip, quickly putting in place a large end-user support organization.', u"This resulted in a $475 million charge against Intel's 1994 revenue.", u'The "Pentium flaw" incident, Intel\'s response to it, and the surrounding media coverage propelled Intel from being a technology supplier generally unknown to most computer users to a household name.', u'Dovetailing with an uptick in the "Intel Inside" campaign, the episode is considered to have been a positive event for Intel, changing some of its business practices to be more end-user focused and generating substantial public awareness, while avoiding a lasting negative impression.', u'==== "Intel Inside" and other campaigns ====\n\nDuring this period, Intel undertook two major supporting advertising campaigns.', u'The first campaign, the 1991 "Intel Inside" marketing and branding campaign, is widely known and has become synonymous with Intel itself.', u'The idea of "ingredient branding" was new at the time, with only Nutrasweet and a few others making attempts to do so.', u'This campaign established Intel, which had been a component supplier little-known outside the PC industry, as a household name.', u'The second campaign, Intel\'s Systems Group, which began in the early 1990s, showcased manufacturing of PC "motherboards", the main board component of a personal computer, and the one into which the processor (CPU) and memory (RAM) chips are plugged.', u'The Systems Group campaign was lesser known than the Intel Inside campaign.', u'Shortly after, Intel began manufacturing fully configured "white box" systems for the dozens of PC clone companies that rapidly sprang up.', u'At its peak in the mid-1990s, Intel manufactured over 15% of all PCs, making it the third-largest supplier at the time.', u'During the 1990s, Intel Architecture Labs (IAL) was responsible for many of the hardware innovations of the personal computer, including the PCI Bus, the PCI Express (PCIe) bus, the Universal Serial Bus (USB).', u"IAL's software efforts met with a more mixed fate; its video and graphics software was important in the development of software digital video, but later its efforts were largely overshadowed by competition from Microsoft.", u'The competition between Intel and Microsoft was revealed in testimony by IAL Vice-President Steven McGeady at the Microsoft antitrust trial.', u'=== Solid-state drives (SSD) ===\n\nOn September 8, 2008, Intel began shipping its first mainstream solid-state drives, the X18-M and X25-M with 80 GB and 160 GB storage capacities.', u'Reviews measured high performance with these MLC-based drives.', u'Intel released its SLC-based Enterprise X25-E Extreme SSDs on October 15 that same year in capacities of 32GB and 64GB.', u'In July 2009, Intel moved its X25-M and X18-M lines from a 50-nanometer to a 34-nanometer process.', u'These new drives, dubbed by the press as the X25-M and X18-M G2 (or generation 2), reduced prices by up to 60 percent while offering lower latency and improved performance.', u'On February 1, 2010, Intel and Micron announced that they were gearing up for production of NAND flash memory using a new 25-nanometer process.', u'In March of that same year, Intel entered the budget SSD segment with its X25-V drives with an initial capacity of 40 GB.', u"The SSD 310, Intel's first mSATA drive was released on December 2010, providing X25-M G2 performance in a much smaller package.", u'March 2011 saw the introduction of two new SSD lines from Intel.', u'The first, the SSD 510, used a SATA 6 Gigabit per second interface to reach speeds of up to 500 MegaBytes per second.', u'The drive, which uses a controller from Marvell Technology Group, was released using 34 nm NAND Flash and came in capacities of 120 GB and 250 GB.', u"The second product announcement, the SSD 320, is the successor to Intel's earlier X25-M.", u'It uses the new 25 nm process that Intel and Micron announced in 2010, and was released in capacities of 40, 80, 120, 16, 300 and 600 GB.', u'Sequential read performance maxes out at 270 MB/s due to the older SATA 3 Gbit/s interface, and sequential write performance varies greatly based on the size of the drive with sequential write performance of the 40 GB model peaking at 45 MB/s and the 600 GB at 220 MB/s.', u'Micron and Intel announced that they were producing their first 20 nm MLC NAND flash on April 14, 2011.', u'In February 2012, Intel launched the SSD 520 series solid state drives using the SandForce SF-2200 controller with sequential read and write speeds of 550 and 520 MB/s respectively with random read and write IOPS as high as 80,000.', u'These drives will replace the 510 series.', u'Intel has released the budget 330 series solid state drive in 60, 120, and 180 GB capacities using 25 nm flash memory and a SandForce controller that have replaced the 320 series.', u'In late 2015, Intel announced that they were producing their first consumer PCIe-based solid state drive, to be named the 750 series.', u'These new drives would either be plugged directly into a compatible PCIe 3.0 x4 slot or into the U.2 connector on the motherboard.', u'=== Supercomputers ===\nThe Intel Scientific Computers division was founded in 1984 by Justin Rattner, in order to design and produce parallel computers based on Intel microprocessors connected in hypercube topologies.', u'In 1992 the name was changed to the Intel Supercomputing Systems Division, and development of the iWarp architecture was also subsumed.', u'The division designed several supercomputer systems, including the Intel iPSC/1, iPSC/2, iPSC/860, Paragon and ASCI Red.', u'In November 2014, Intel revealed that it is going to use light beams to speed up supercomputers.', u'The renowned chip maker has also disclosed that all its Supercomputer forms will use optical technology for data transfer from 2015.', u'=== Competition, antitrust and espionage ===\n\nTwo factors combined to end this dominance: the slowing of PC demand growth beginning in 2000 and the rise of the low cost PC.', u'By the end of the 1990s, microprocessor performance had outstripped software demand for that CPU power.', u'Aside from high-end server systems and software, whose demand dropped with the end of the "dot-com bubble", consumer systems ran effectively on increasingly low-cost systems after 2000.', u"Intel's strategy of producing ever-more-powerful processors and obsoleting their predecessors stumbled, leaving an opportunity for rapid gains by competitors, notably AMD.", u'This in turn lowered the profitability of the processor line and ended an era of unprecedented dominance of the PC hardware by Intel.', u"Intel's dominance in the x86 microprocessor market led to numerous charges of antitrust violations over the years, including FTC investigations in both the late 1980s and in 1999, and civil actions such as the 1997 suit by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) and a patent suit by Intergraph.", u"Intel's market dominance (at one time it controlled over 85% of the market for 32-bit x86 microprocessors) combined with Intel's own hardball legal tactics (such as its infamous 338 patent suit versus PC manufacturers) made it an attractive target for litigation, but few of the lawsuits ever amounted to anything.", u'A case of industrial espionage arose in 1995 that involved both Intel and AMD.', u"Bill Gaede, an Argentine formerly employed both at AMD and at Intel's Arizona plant, was arrested for attempting in 1993 to sell the i486 and P5 Pentium designs to AMD and to certain foreign powers.", u"Gaede videotaped data from his computer screen at Intel and mailed it to AMD, which immediately alerted Intel and authorities, resulting in Gaede's arrest.", u'Gaede was convicted and sentenced to 33 months in prison in June 1996.', u"=== Use of Intel products by Apple Computer (2005-present) ===\n\nOn June 6, 2005, Steve Jobs, then CEO of Apple, announced that Apple would be transitioning from its long favored PowerPC architecture to the Intel x86 architecture, because the future PowerPC road map was unable to satisfy Apple's needs.", u'The first Macintosh computers containing Intel CPUs were announced on January 10, 2006, and Apple had its entire line of consumer Macs running on Intel processors by early August 2006.', u"The Apple Xserve server was updated to Intel Xeon processors from November 2006, and was offered in a configuration similar to Apple's Mac Pro.", u'=== Core 2 Duo advertisement controversy (2007) ===\nIn July 2007, the company released a print advertisement for its Intel Core 2 Duo processor featuring six African American runners appearing to bow down to a Caucasian male inside of an office setting (due to the posture taken by runners on starting blocks).', u'According to Nancy Bhagat, Vice President of Intel Corporate Marketing, viewers found the ad to be "insensitive and insulting."', u"and several Intel executives made public apologies\n\n\n=== Introduction of Classmate PC (2011) ===\nThe Classmate PC is the company's first low-cost netbook computer.", u'In 2014, the company released an updated version of the Classmate PC.', u'=== Introduction of new mobile processor technology (2011) ===\nIn June 2011, Intel introduced the first Pentium mobile processor based on the Sandy Bridge core.', u'The B940, clocked at 2 GHz, is faster than existing or upcoming mobile Celerons, although it is almost identical to dual-core Celeron CPUs in all other aspects.', u"According to IHS iSuppli's report on September 28, 2011, Sandy Bridge chips have helped Intel increase its market share in global processor market to 81.8%, while AMD's market share dropped to 10.4%.", u'Intel planned to introduce Medfield \u2013 a processor for tablets and smartphones \u2013 to the market in 2012, as an effort to compete with ARM.', u"As a 32-nanometer processor, Medfield is designed to be energy-efficient, which is one of the core features in ARM's chips.", u"At the Intel Developers Forum (IDF) 2011 in San Francisco, Intel's partnership with Google was announced.", u"By January 2012, Google's Android 2.3 will use Intel's Atom microprocessor.", u'=== Update to server chips (2011) ===\nIn July 2011, Intel announced that its server chips, the Xeon series, will use new sensors that can improve data center cooling efficiency.', u'=== Introduction of Ivy Bridge 22 nm processors (2011) ===\nIn 2011, Intel announced the Ivy Bridge processor family at the Intel DeveConflict FreeCloper Forum.', u'Ivy Bridge supports both DDR3 memory and DDR3L chips.', u'=== Development of Personal Office Energy Monitor (POEM) (2011) ===\nAs part of its efforts in the Positive Energy Buildings Consortium, Intel has been developing an application, called Personal Office Energy Monitor (POEM), to help office buildings to be more energy-efficient.', u'With this application, employees can get the power consumption info for their office machines, so that they can figure out a better way to save energy in their working environment.', u'=== IT Manager 3: Unseen Forces ===\nIT Manager 3: Unseen Forces was a web-based IT simulation game introduced by Intel in 2009.', u"In it you manage a company's IT department.", u'The goal is to apply technology and skill to enable the company to grow from a small business into a global enterprise.', u'The game has since been discontinued.', u'=== Car Security System (2011) ===\nIn 2011, Intel announced that it is working on a car security system that connects to smartphones via an application.', u'The application works by streaming video to a cloud service if your car is broken into.', u'=== High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection ===\nIntel also developed High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) to prevent access of digital audio and video content as it travels across connections.', u'=== Move from Wintel desktop to open mobile platforms (2013\u20132014) ===\nIn 2013, Intel\'s Kirk Skaugen said that Intel\'s exclusive focus on Microsoft platforms was a thing of the past and that they would now support all "tier-one operating systems" such as Linux, Android, iOS, and Chrome.', u'In 2014, Intel cut thousands of employees in response to "evolving market trends", and offered to subsidize manufacturers for the extra costs involved in using Intel chips in their tablets.', u'=== Introduction of Haswell processors (2013) ===\nIn June 2013, Intel unveiled its fourth generation of Intel Core processors (Haswell) in an event named Computex in Taipei.', u'=== Wearable fashion (2014) ===\nOn January 6, 2014, Intel announced that it was "teaming with the Council of Fashion Designers of America, Barneys New York and Opening Ceremony around the wearable tech field."', u'Intel has developed a reference design for wearable smart earbuds that provide biometric and fitness information.', u'The Intel smart earbuds provide full stereo audio, and monitor heart rate, while the applications on the user\u2019s phone keep track of run distance and calories burned.', u'=== Fog computing ===\nOn November 19, 2015, Intel, alongside ARM Holdings, Dell, Cisco Systems, Microsoft, and Princeton University, founded the OpenFog Consortium, to promote interests and development in fog computing.', u"Intel's Chief Strategist for the IoT Strategy and Technology Office, Jeff Faders, became the consortium's first president.", u'=== Conflict Free ===\nIn July 2016, Intel began a campaign announcing that all of their processor products were Conflict Free, meaning that the minerals used to create those products was sourced responsibly, and minimized the risk of human life.', u"Intel's Conflict Free campaign was publicized massively after Intel sent packages to YouTube personalities Linus Sebastian, Lewis Hilsenteger from Unbox Therapy and Joanne Chiang.", u"== Corporate affairs ==\n\n\n=== Leadership and corporate structure ===\n\nRobert Noyce was Intel's CEO at its founding in 1968, followed by co-founder Gordon Moore in 1975.", u"Andy Grove became the company's president in 1979 and added the CEO title in 1987 when Moore became chairman.", u'In 1998, Grove succeeded Moore as Chairman, and Craig Barrett, already company president, took over.', u"On May 18, 2005, Barrett handed the reins of the company over to Paul Otellini, who had been the company president and COO and who was responsible for Intel's design win in the original IBM PC.", u'The board of directors elected Otellini as President and CEO, and Barrett replaced Grove as Chairman of the Board.', u'Grove stepped down as chairman, but is retained as a special adviser.', u'In May 2009, Barrett stepped down as chairman of the Board and was succeeded by Jane Shaw.', u'In May 2012, Intel vice chairman Andy Bryant, who had held the posts of CFO (1994) and Chief Administrative Officer (2007) at Intel, succeeded Shaw as executive chairman.', u"In November 2012, president and CEO Paul Otellini announced that he would step down in May 2013 at the age of 62, three years before the company's mandatory retirement age.", u"During a six-month transition period, Intel's board of directors commenced a search process for the next CEO, in which it considered both internal managers and external candidates such as Sanjay Jha and Patrick Gelsinger.", u"Financial results revealed that, under Otellini, Intel's revenue increased by 55.8 percent (US$34.2 to 53.3 billion), while its net income increased by 46.7% (US$7.5 billion to 11 billion).", u"On May 2, 2013, Executive Vice President and COO Brian Krzanich was elected as Intel's sixth CEO, a selection that became effective on May 16, 2013 at the company's annual meeting.", u"Reportedly, the board concluded that an insider could proceed with the role and exert an impact more quickly, without the need to learn Intel's processes, and Krzanich was selected on such a basis.", u"Intel's software head Ren\xe9e James was selected as president of the company, a role that is second to the CEO position.", u"As of May 2013, Intel's board of directors consists of Andy Bryant, John Donahoe, Frank Yeary, Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky, Susan Decker, Reed Hundt, Paul Otellini, James Plummer, David Pottruck, and David Yoffie.", u'The board was described by former Financial Times journalist Tom Foremski as "an exemplary example of corporate governance of the highest order" and received a rating of ten from GovernanceMetrics International, a form of recognition that has only been awarded to twenty-one other corporate boards worldwide.', u'=== Employment ===\n\nThe firm promotes very heavily from within, most notably in its executive suite.', u'The company has resisted the trend toward outsider CEOs.', u'Paul Otellini was a 30-year veteran of the company when he assumed the role of CEO.', u'All of his top lieutenants have risen through the ranks after many years with the firm.', u"In many cases, Intel's top executives have spent their entire working careers with Intel.", u'Intel has a mandatory retirement policy for its CEOs when they reach age 65.', u'Andy Grove retired at 62, while both Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore retired at 58.', u'Grove retired as Chairman and as a member of the board of directors in 2005 at age 68.', u"Intel's headquarters are located in Santa Clara, California, and the company has operations around the world.", u'Its largest workforce concentration anywhere is in Washington County, Oregon (in the Portland metropolitan area\'s "Silicon Forest"), with 18,600 employees at several facilities.', u'Outside the United States, the company has facilities in China, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Israel, Ireland, India, Russia, Argentina and Vietnam, in 63 countries and regions internationally.', u'In the U.S. Intel employs significant numbers of people in California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Washington and Utah.', u"In Oregon, Intel is the state's largest private employer.", u'The company is the largest industrial employer in New Mexico while in Arizona the company has over 10,000 employees.', u'Intel invests heavily in research in China and about 100 researchers \u2013  or 10% of the total number of researchers from Intel \u2013  are located in Beijing.', u'In 2011, the Israeli government offered Intel $290 million to expand in the country.', u'As a condition, Intel would employ 1,500 more workers in Kiryat Gat and between 600\u20131000 workers in the north.', u'In January 2014, it was reported that Intel would cut about 5,000 jobs from its work force of 107,000.', u'The announcement was made a day after it reported earnings that missed analyst targets.', u'In March 2014, it was reported that Intel would embark upon a $6 billion plan to expand its activities in Israel.', u'The plan calls for continued investment in existing and new Intel plants until 2030.', u'As of 2014 Intel employs 10,000 workers at four development centers and two production plants in Israel.', u'==== Diversity ====\nIntel has a Diversity Initiative, including employee diversity groups as well as supplier diversity programs.', u'Like many companies with employee diversity groups, they include groups based on race and nationality as well as sexual identity and religion.', u'In 1994, Intel sanctioned one of the earliest corporate Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender employee groups, and supports a Muslim employees group, a Jewish employees group, and a Bible-based Christian group.', u'Intel received a 100% rating on the first Corporate Equality Index released by the Human Rights Campaign in 2002.', u'It has maintained this rating in 2003 and 2004.', u'In addition, the company was named one of the 100 Best Companies for Working Mothers in 2005 by Working Mother magazine.', u'In January 2015, Intel announced the investment of $300 million over the next five years to enhance gender and racial diversity in their own company as well as the technology industry as a whole.', u'In February 2016, Intel released its Global Diversity & Inclusion 2015 Annual Report.', u'The male-female mix of US employees was reported as 75.2% men and 24.8% women.', u'For US employees in technical roles, the mix was reported as 79.8% male and 20.1% female.', u'NPR reports that Intel is facing a retention problem (particularly for African Americans), not just a pipeline problem.', u"=== Economic impact in Oregon in 2009 ===\nIn 2011, ECONorthwest conducted an economic impact analysis of Intel's economic contribution to the state of Oregon.", u'The report found that in 2009 "the total economic impacts attributed to Intel\'s operations, capital spending, contributions and taxes amounted to almost $14.6 billion in activity, including $4.3 billion in personal income and 59,990 jobs."', u'Through multiplier effects, every 10 Intel jobs supported, on average, was found to create 31 jobs in other sectors of the economy.', u'=== School funding in New Mexico in 1997 ===\nIn Rio Rancho, New Mexico, Intel is the leading employer.', u'In 1997, a community partnership between Sandoval County and Intel Corporation funded and built Rio Rancho High School.', u"=== Ultrabook fund (2011) ===\nIn 2011, Intel Capital announced a new fund to support startups working on technologies in line with the company's concept for next generation notebooks.", u'The company is setting aside a $300 million fund to be spent over the next three to four years in areas related to ultrabooks.', u'Intel announced the ultrabook concept at Computex in 2011.', u'The ultrabook is defined as a thin (less than 0.8 inches [~2 cm] thick) notebook that utilizes Intel processors and also incorporates tablet features such as a touch screen and long battery life.', u"At the Intel Developers Forum in 2011, four Taiwan ODMs showed prototype ultrabooks that used Intel's Ivy Bridge chips.", u'Intel plans to improve power consumption of its chips for ultrabooks, like new Ivy Bridge processors in 2013, which will only have 10W default thermal design power.', u"Intel's goal for Ultrabook's price is below $1000; however, according to two presidents from Acer and Compaq, this goal will not be achieved if Intel does not lower the price of its chips.", u"=== Advertising and brand management ===\n\n\n==== Intel Inside ====\nIntel has become one of the world's most recognizable computer brands following its long-running Intel Inside campaign.", u'The idea for "Intel Inside" came out of a meeting between Intel and one of the major computer resellers, MicroAge.', u"In the late 1980s, Intel's market share was being seriously eroded by upstart competitors such as Advanced Micro Devices (now AMD), Zilog, and others who had started to sell their less expensive microprocessors to computer manufacturers.", u'This was because, by using cheaper processors, manufacturers could make cheaper computers and gain more market share in an increasingly price-sensitive market.', u"In 1989, Intel's Dennis Carter visited MicroAge's headquarters in Tempe, Arizona, to meet with MicroAge's VP of Marketing, Ron Mion.", u'MicroAge had become one of the largest distributors of Compaq, IBM, HP, and others and thus was a primary \u2013  although indirect \u2013  driver of demand for microprocessors.', u'Intel wanted MicroAge to petition its computer suppliers to favor Intel chips.', u'However, Mion felt that the marketplace should decide which processors they wanted.', u"Intel's counterargument was that it would be too difficult to educate PC buyers on why Intel microprocessors were worth paying more for ... and they were right.", u"But Mion felt that the public didn't really need to fully understand why Intel chips were better, they just needed to feel they were better.", u'So Mion proposed a market test.', u'Intel would pay for a MicroAge billboard somewhere saying, "If you\'re buying a personal computer, make sure it has Intel inside."', u'In turn, MicroAge would put "Intel Inside" stickers on the Intel-based computers in their stores in that area.', u'To make the test easier to monitor, Mion decided to do the test in Boulder, Colorado, where it had a single store.', u'Virtually overnight, the sales of personal computers in that store dramatically shifted to Intel-based PCs.', u'Intel very quickly adopted "Intel Inside" as its primary branding and rolled it out worldwide.', u'As is often the case with computer lore, other tidbits have been combined to explain how things evolved.', u'"Intel Inside" has not escaped that tendency and there are other "explanations" that had been floating around.', u'Intel\'s branding campaign started with "The Computer Inside" tagline in 1990 in the US and Europe.', u'The Japan chapter of Intel proposed an "Intel in it" tagline and kicked off the Japanese campaign by hosting EKI-KON (meaning "Station Concert" in Japanese) at the Tokyo railway station dome on Christmas Day, December 25, 1990.', u'Several months later, "The Computer Inside" incorporated the Japan idea to become "Intel Inside" which eventually elevated to the worldwide branding campaign in 1991, by Intel marketing manager Dennis Carter.', u'The case study of the Inside Intel Inside was put together by Harvard Business School.', u'The five-note jingle was introduced in 1994 and by its tenth anniversary was being heard in 130 countries around the world.', u'The initial branding agency for the "Intel Inside" campaign was DahlinSmithWhite Advertising of Salt Lake City.', u'The Intel swirl logo was the work of DahlinSmithWhite art director Steve Grigg under the direction of Intel president and CEO Andy Grove.', u'The Intel Inside advertising campaign sought public brand loyalty and awareness of Intel processors in consumer computers.', u"Intel paid some of the advertiser's costs for an ad that used the Intel Inside logo and xylo-marimba jingle.", u'In 2008, Intel planned to shift the emphasis of its Intel Inside campaign from traditional media such as television and print to newer media such as the Internet.', u'Intel required that a minimum of 35% of the money it provided to the companies in its co-op program be used for online marketing.', u'The Intel 2010 annual financial report indicated that $1.8 billion (6% of the gross margin and nearly 16% of the total net income) was allocated to all advertising with Intel Inside being part of that.', u'==== Sonic logo ====\nThe famous D\u266d  D\u266d  G\u266d  D\u266d  A\u266d xylophone/xylomarimba jingle, sonic logo, tag, audio mnemonic was produced by Musikvergnuegen and written by Walter Werzowa, once a member of the Austrian 1980s sampling band Edelweiss.', u'The sonic Intel logo has undergone substantial changes in tone since the introduction of the Pentium III, Pentium 4, and Core processors, yet keeps the same jingle.', u'==== Processor naming strategy ====\nIn 2006, Intel expanded its promotion of open specification platforms beyond Centrino, to include the Viiv media center PC and the business desktop Intel vPro.', u'In mid-January 2006, Intel announced that they were dropping the long running Pentium name from their processors.', u'The Pentium name was first used to refer to the P5 core Intel processors and was done to comply with court rulings that prevent the trademarking of a string of numbers, so competitors could not just call their processor the same name, as had been done with the prior 386 and 486 processors (both of which had copies manufactured by IBM and AMD).', u'They phased out the Pentium names from mobile processors first, when the new Yonah chips, branded Core Solo and Core Duo, were released.', u'The desktop processors changed when the Core 2 line of processors were released.', u'By 2009, Intel was using a good-better-best strategy with Celeron being good, Pentium better, and the Intel Core family representing the best the company has to offer.', u'According to spokesman Bill Calder, Intel has maintained only the Celeron brand, the Atom brand for netbooks and the vPro lineup for businesses.', u"Since late 2009, Intel's mainstream processors have been called Celeron, Pentium, Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7, in order of performance from lowest to highest.", u'The first generation core products carry a 3 digit name, such as i5 750, and the second generation products carry a 4 digit name, such as the i5 2500.', u'In both cases, a K at the end of it shows that it is an unlocked processor, enabling additional overclocking abilities (for instance, 2500K).', u'vPro products will carry the Intel Core i7 vPro processor or the Intel Core i5 vPro processor name.', u'In October 2011, Intel started to sell its Core i7-2700K "Sandy Bridge" chip to customers worldwide.', u'Since 2010, "Centrino" is only being applied to Intel\'s WiMAX and Wi-Fi technologies.', u'=== Open source support ===\nIntel has a significant participation in the open source communities since 1999.', u'For example, in 2006 Intel released MIT-licensed X.org drivers for their integrated graphic cards of the i965 family of chipsets.', u'Intel released FreeBSD drivers for some networking cards, available under a BSD-compatible license, which were also ported to OpenBSD.', u'Binary firmware files for non-wireless Ethernet devices were also released under a BSD licence allowing free redistribution.', u'Intel ran the Moblin project until April 23, 2009, when they handed the project over to the Linux Foundation.', u'Intel also runs the LessWatts.org campaigns.', u'However, after the release of the wireless products called Intel Pro/Wireless 2100, 2200BG/2225BG/2915ABG and 3945ABG in 2005, Intel was criticized for not granting free redistribution rights for the firmware that must be included in the operating system for the wireless devices to operate.', u'As a result of this, Intel became a target of campaigns to allow free operating systems to include binary firmware on terms acceptable to the open source community.', u'Linspire-Linux creator Michael Robertson outlined the difficult position that Intel was in releasing to open source, as Intel did not want to upset their large customer Microsoft.', u'Theo de Raadt of OpenBSD also claimed that Intel is being "an Open Source fraud" after an Intel employee presented a distorted view of the situation at an open-source conference.', u'In spite of the significant negative attention Intel received as a result of the wireless dealings, the binary firmware still has not gained a license compatible with free software principles.', u'=== Declining PC sales ===\nDue to PC declining sales and the condition prediction will be worse which Intel support the chipsets, so in 2016 Intel cuts 12,000 jobs.', u'In 2014, Intel has also cut 5,000 jobs.', u'== Controversies ==\n\n\n=== Patent infringement litigation (2006\u20132007) ===\nIn October 2006, a Transmeta lawsuit was filed against Intel for patent infringement on computer architecture and power efficiency technologies.', u'The lawsuit was settled in October 2007, with Intel agreeing to pay US$150 million initially and US$20 million per year for the next five years.', u'Both companies agreed to drop lawsuits against each other, while Intel was granted a perpetual non-exclusive license to use current and future patented Transmeta technologies in its chips for 10 years.', u"=== Anti-competitive allegations and litigation (2005\u20132009) ===\n\nIn September 2005, Intel filed a response to an AMD lawsuit, disputing AMD's claims, and claiming that Intel's business practices are fair and lawful.", u"In a rebuttal, Intel deconstructed AMD's offensive strategy and argued that AMD struggled largely as a result of its own bad business decisions, including underinvestment in essential manufacturing capacity and excessive reliance on contracting out chip foundries.", u"Legal analysts predicted the lawsuit would drag on for a number of years, since Intel's initial response indicated its unwillingness to settle with AMD.", u'In 2008 a court date was finally set, but in 2009, Intel settled with a $1.25 billion payout to AMD (see below).', u'On November 4, 2009, New York\'s attorney general filed an antitrust lawsuit against Intel Corp, claiming the company used "illegal threats and collusion" to dominate the market for computer microprocessors.', u'On November 12, 2009, AMD agreed to drop the antitrust lawsuit against Intel in exchange for $1.25 billion.', u'A joint press release published by the two chip makers stated "While the relationship between the two companies has been difficult in the past, this agreement ends the legal disputes and enables the companies to focus all of our efforts on product innovation and development."', u'An antitrust lawsuit and a class-action suit relating to cold calling employees of other companies has been settled.', u'==== Allegations by Japan Fair Trade Commission (2005) ====\nIn 2005, the local Fair Trade Commission found that Intel violated the Japanese Antimonopoly Act.', u'The commission ordered Intel to eliminate discounts that had discriminated against AMD.', u'To avoid a trial, Intel agreed to comply with the order.', u'==== Allegations by the European Union (2007\u20132008) ====\nIn July 2007, the European Commission accused Intel of anti-competitive practices, mostly against AMD.', u'The allegations, going back to 2003, include giving preferential prices to computer makers buying most or all of their chips from Intel, paying computer makers to delay or cancel the launch of products using AMD chips, and providing chips at below standard cost to governments and educational institutions.', u'Intel responded that the allegations were unfounded and instead qualified its market behavior as consumer-friendly.', u'General counsel Bruce Sewell responded that the Commission had misunderstood some factual assumptions as to pricing and manufacturing costs.', u'In February 2008, Intel stated that its office in Munich had been raided by European Union regulators.', u'Intel reported that it was cooperating with investigators.', u'Intel faced a fine of up to 10% of its annual revenue, if found guilty of stifling competition.', u'AMD subsequently launched a website promoting these allegations.', u'In June 2008, the EU filed new charges against Intel.', u'In May 2009, the EU found that Intel had engaged in anti-competitive practices and subsequently fined Intel \u20ac1.06 billion (US$1.44 billion), a record amount.', u'Intel was found to have paid companies, including Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo and NEC, to exclusively use Intel chips in their products, and therefore harmed other companies including AMD.', u'The European Commission said that Intel had deliberately acted to keep competitors out of the computer chip market and in doing so had made a "serious and sustained violation of the EU\'s antitrust rules".', u'In addition to the fine, Intel was ordered by the Commission to immediately cease all illegal practices.', u"Intel has stated that they will appeal against the Commission's verdict.", u'In June 2014, the General Court, which sits below the European Court of Justice, rejected the appeal.', u'==== Allegations by regulators in South Korea (2007) ====\nIn September 2007, South Korean regulators accused Intel of breaking antitrust law.', u"The investigation began in February 2006, when officials raided Intel's South Korean offices.", u'The company risked a penalty of up to 3% of its annual sales, if found guilty.', u'In June 2008, the Fair Trade Commission ordered Intel to pay a fine of US$25.5 million for taking advantage of its dominant position to offer incentives to major Korean PC manufacturers on the condition of not buying products from AMD.', u'==== Allegations by regulators in the United States (2008\u20132010) ====\nNew York started an investigation of Intel in January 2008 on whether the company violated antitrust laws in pricing and sales of its microprocessors.', u'In June 2008, the Federal Trade Commission also began an antitrust investigation of the case.', u'In December 2009, the FTC announced it would initiate an administrative proceeding against Intel in September 2010.', u'In November 2009, following a two-year investigation, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo sued Intel, accusing them of bribery and coercion, claiming that Intel bribed computer makers to buy more of their chips than those of their rivals, and threatened to withdraw these payments if the computer makers were perceived as working too closely with its competitors.', u'Intel has denied these claims.', u'On July 22, 2010, Dell agreed to a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to pay $100M in penalties resulting from charges that Dell did not accurately disclose accounting information to investors.', u'In particular, the SEC charged that from 2002 to 2006, Dell had an agreement with Intel to receive rebates in exchange for not using chips manufactured by AMD.', u'These substantial rebates were not disclosed to investors, but were used to help meet investor expectations regarding the company\'s financial performance; "These exclusivity payments grew from 10 percent of Dell\'s operating income in FY 2003 to 38 percent in FY 2006, and peaked at 76 percent in the first quarter of FY 2007.".', u"Dell eventually did adopt AMD as a secondary supplier in 2006, and Intel subsequently stopped their rebates, causing Dell's financial performance to fall.", u'=== Corporate responsibility record ===\nIntel has been accused by some residents of Rio Rancho, New Mexico of allowing VOCs to be released in excess of their pollution permit.', u'One resident claimed that a release of 1.4 tons of carbon tetrachloride was measured from one acid scrubber during the fourth quarter of 2003 but an emission factor allowed Intel to report no carbon tetrachloride emissions for all of 2003.', u'Another resident alleges that Intel was responsible for the release of other VOCs from their Rio Rancho site and that a necropsy of lung tissue from two deceased dogs in the area indicated trace amounts of toluene, hexane, ethylbenzene, and xylene isomers, all of which are solvents used in industrial settings but also commonly found in gasoline, retail paint thinners and retail solvents.', u"During a sub-committee meeting of the New Mexico Environment Improvement Board, a resident claimed that Intel's own reports documented more than 1,580 pounds (720 kg) of VOCs were released in June and July 2006.", u"Intel's environmental performance is published annually in their corporate responsibility report.", u'In its 2012 rankings on the progress of consumer electronics companies relating to conflict minerals, the Enough Project rated Intel the best of 24 companies, calling it a "Pioneer of progress".', u"In 2014, chief executive Brian Krzanich urged the rest of the industry to follow Intel's lead by also shunning conflict minerals.", u'=== Age discrimination complaints ===\nIntel has faced complaints of age discrimination in firing and layoffs.', u'Intel was sued in 1993 by nine former employees, over allegations that they were laid off because they were over the age of 40.', u'A group called FACE Intel (Former and Current Employees of Intel) claims that Intel weeds out older employees.', u'FACE Intel claims that more than 90 percent of people who have been laid off or fired from Intel are over the age of 40.', u'Upside magazine requested data from Intel breaking out its hiring and firing by age, but the company declined to provide any.', u"Intel has denied that age plays any role in Intel's employment practices.", u'FACE Intel was founded by Ken Hamidi, who was fired from Intel in 1995 at the age of 47.', u"Hamidi was blocked in a 1999 court decision from using Intel's email system to distribute criticism of the company to employees, which overturned in 2003 in Intel Corp. v. Hamidi.", u'=== Tax dispute in India ===\nIn August 2016, Indian officials of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) blocked the gates of the Intel campus in Bengaluru with garbage trucks for evading payment of property taxes between 2007 and 2008 to the tune of Rs 34 crores.', u'As an interim measure the court had directed Intel to pay Rs 17 crore, which is half the amount the company owed, by July 25, 2016.', u'However, after all such warnings were repeatedly ignored by the IT giant, the BBMP resorted to a very creative tactic and decided to block the gates of the IT major with garbage trucks.', u"According to the Joint Commissioner of the Mahadevapura zone, BBMP Muniveerappa, in-spite of the company's premises being centrally air conditioned, it had been calculating its taxes on the basis that it was not an air conditioned office.", u'Intel has sought time of four weeks to pay their dues.', u'== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\n\nIntel at DMOZ'], 'year': '1968-07-18', 'title': 'Intel is incorporated.'}

Richard Nash, Cy Coleman, and Carolyn Leigh, starring Lucille Ball, directed by Herbert Ross and choreographed by Michael Kidd.', u'He was listed in the program as "Bill Walker".', u'A frequent performer in summer stock during the 1960s, Walker sang in many performances with the St. Louis Municipal Opera, the Kansas City Starlight Theatre, and the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera in such works as Blossom Time, The Desert Song, Damn Yankees, and Carousel.', u'In 1962, Walker was a finalist in the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions and was offered a contract to join the Metropolitan Opera.', u'His first roles at the Met were small ones, but subsequent exposure on television shows such as The Bell Telephone Hour, The Voice of Firestone, and most notably The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\u2014where Walker appeared some 60 times \u2013 led to a higher profile in his opera career.', u'During his 18 seasons there, Walker gave more than 360 performances at the Met and sang the role of Marcello in La boh\xe8me more than 30 times.', u'In 1965, Walker was featured in two new productions at the Met.', u'He was selected to sing the role of Valentin in Faust co-starring Nicolai Gedda, Gabriella Tucci and Cesare Siepi, directed by Jean-Louis Barrault and conducted by Georges Pr\xeatre.', u"He also sang the role of Prince Yeletsky in a new English-language production of Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades, conducted by Thomas Schippers.", u'In 1972, Walker repeated the role in the first production of The Queen of Spades ever presented in its original Russian at the Met.', u'In 1975 when the Met toured Japan for the first time, Walker sang the role of Marcello in La boh\xe8me with Franco Corelli and Dorothy Kirsten.', u'The following season, Walker stepped in for an ailing colleague and sang the role of Germont in La traviata for the first time at the Met, a role he had already sung at the Santa Fe Opera and in other regional productions.', u'Critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote in The New York Times, "the best singing of the night came from Mr. Walker," and Time magazine called his Germont "splendidly sung."', u"Other roles at the Met included Figaro in The Barber of Seville, Papageno in The Magic Flute, Lescaut in Manon Lescaut, Sharpless in Madama Butterfly, Ford in Falstaff, Escamillo in Carmen, the High Priest in Samson et Dalila, Peter in Hansel und

the Carter administration, he sang at a White House state dinner honoring Helmut Schmidt, Chancellor of West Germany.', u'In 1976, under the auspices of the U.S. State department, Walker was sent abroad to perform as a representative of the United States.', u'In addition to recitals in Reykjav\xedk, Iceland and at the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm, Walker sang Germont in La traviata and Amonasro in Aida in both Warsaw and \u0141\xf3d\u017a, in Poland.', u'From 1969 to 1976, Walker gave more than 250 solo recitals in the United States and Canada, performing classical operatic arias, art songs and American musical show stoppers, most memorably "Soliloquy" from Carousel and "Surrey With The Fringe On Top" from Oklahoma!.', u'With a technique considered innovative at the time, Walker addressed his recital audiences directly from the stage, interspersing his songs with funny, often self-deprecating stories, making him a more accessible performer to his audiences then the stereotypically aloof classical artist.', u'Walker was a frequent soloist with many great American orchestras, including the Cleveland Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic, and the Philadelphia Orchestra.', u"In the '70s, Walker appeared twice at Carnegie Hall as the baritone soloist in performances of Mahler's 8th Symphony with the Chicago Symphony, conducted by Sir Georg Solti.", u'Walker

Vabariikide Liit\nIn some cases, due to the length of its name, the state was referred to as the "Soviet Union" or the "USSR" especially when used in the Western media.', u'It was erroneously called "Russia" as well in some encyclopedic sources.', u"== Geography, climate and environment ==\n\nWith an area of 22,402,200 square kilometres (8,649,500 sq mi), the Soviet Union was the world's largest country, a status that is retained by the Russian Federation.", u"Covering a sixth of Earth's land surface, its size was comparable to that of North America.", u"The European portion accounted for a quarter of the country's area, and was the cultural and economic center.", u'The eastern part in Asia extended to the Pacific Ocean to the east and Afghanistan to the south, and, except some areas in Central Asia, was much less populous.', u'It spanned over 10,000 kilometres (6,200 mi) east to west across 11 time zones, and over 7,200 kilometres (4,500 mi) north to south.', u'It had five climate zones: tundra, taiga, steppes, desert, and mountains.', u"The Soviet Union had the world's longest border, like Russia, measuring over 60,000 kilometres (37,000 mi), or \u200a1 1\u20442 circumferences of Earth.", u'Two-thirds of it was a coastline.', u'Across the Bering Strait was the United States.', u'The Soviet Union bordered Afghanistan, China, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Hungary, Iran, Mongolia, North Korea, Norway, Poland, Romania, and Turkey from 1945 to 1991.', u"The Soviet Union's highest mountain was Communism Peak (now Ismoil Somoni Peak) in Tajikistan, at 7,495 metres (24,590 ft).", u"The Soviet Union also included most of the world's largest lake, the Caspian Sea (shared with Iran), and Lake Baikal, the world's largest freshwater and deepest lake, an internal body of water in Russia.", u'== History ==\n\nThe last Russian Tsar, Nicholas II, ruled the Russian Empire until his abdication in March 1917 in the aftermath of the February Revolution, due in part to the strain of fighting in World War I, which lacked public support.', u'A short-lived Russian Provisional Government took power, to be overthrown in the October Revolution (N.S.', u'7 November 1917) by revolutionaries led by the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin.', u'The Soviet Union was officially established in December 1922 with the union of the Russian, Ukrainian, Byelorussian, and Transcaucasian Soviet republics, each ruled by local Bolshevik parties.', u'Despite the foundation of the Soviet state as a federative entity of many constituent republics, each with its own political and administrative entities, the term "Soviet Russia" \u2013 strictly applicable only to the Russian Federative Socialist Republic \u2013 was often applied to the entire country by non-Soviet writers and politicians.', u'=== Revolution and foundation ===\n\nModern revolutionary activity in the Russian Empire began with the Decembrist revolt of 1825.', u'Although serfdom was abolished in 1861, it was done on terms unfavorable to the peasants and served to encourage revolutionaries.', u'A parliament\u2014the State Duma\u2014was established in 1906 after the Russian Revolution of 1905, but Tsar Nicholas II resisted attempts to move from absolute to constitutional monarchy.', u'Social unrest continued and was aggravated during World War I by military defeat and food shortages in major Soviet cities.', u"A spontaneous popular uprising in Petrograd, in response to the wartime decay of Russia's economy and morale, culminated in the February Revolution and the toppling of the imperial government in March 1917.", u'The tsarist autocracy was replaced by the Russian Provisional Government, which intended to conduct elections to the Russian Constituent Assembly and to continue fighting on the side of the Entente in World War I.', u'At the same time, workers\' councils, known in Russian as "Soviets", sprang up across the country.', u'The Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, pushed for socialist revolution in the Soviets and on the streets.', u'On 7 November 1917, the Red Guards stormed the Winter Palace in Petrograd, ending the rule of the Provisional Government and leaving all political power to the Soviets.', u'This event would later be known as the Great October Socialist Revolution.', u'In December, the Bolsheviks signed an armistice with the Central Powers, though by February 1918, fighting had resumed.', u'In March, the Soviets ended involvement in the war for good and signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.', u"A long and bloody Civil War ensued between the Reds and the Whites, starting in 1917 and ending in 1923 with the Reds' victory.", u'It included foreign intervention, the execution of the former tsar and his family, and the famine of 1921, which killed about five million people.', u'In March 1921, during a related conflict with Poland, the Peace of Riga was signed, splitting disputed territories in Belarus and Ukraine between the Republic of Poland and Soviet Russia.', u'Soviet Russia had to resolve similar conflicts with the newly established Republic of Finland, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia, and the Republic of Lithuania.', u'=== Unification of republics ===\n\nOn 28 December 1922, a conference of plenipotentiary delegations from the Russian SFSR, the Transcaucasian SFSR, the Ukrainian SSR and the Byelorussian SSR approved the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR and the Declaration of the Creation of the USSR, forming the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.', u'These two documents were confirmed by the 1st Congress of Soviets of the USSR and signed by the heads of the delegations, Mikhail Kalinin, Mikhail Tskhakaya, Mikhail Frunze, Grigory Petrovsky, and Alexander Chervyakov, on 30 December 1922.', u'The formal proclamation was made from the stage of the Bolshoi Theatre.', u'On 1 February 1924, the USSR was recognized by the British Empire.', u'The same year, a Soviet Constitution was approved, legitimizing the December 1922 union.', u'An intensive restructuring of the economy, industry and politics of the country began in the early days of Soviet power in 1917.', u'A large part of this was done according to the Bolshevik Initial Decrees, government documents signed by Vladimir Lenin.', u'One of the most prominent breakthroughs was the GOELRO plan, which envisioned a major restructuring of the Soviet economy based on total electrification of the country.', u'The plan was developed in 1920 and covered a 10 to 15-year period.', u'It included construction of a network of 30 regional power stations, including ten large hydroelectric power plants, and numerous electric-powered large industrial enterprises.', u'The plan became the prototype for subsequent Five-Year Plans and was fulfilled by 1931.', u'=== Stalin era ===\n\nFrom its creation, the government in the Soviet Union was based on the one-party rule of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks).', u'After the economic policy of "War communism" during the Russian Civil War, as a prelude to fully developing socialism in the country, the Soviet government permitted some private enterprise to coexist alongside nationalized industry in the 1920s and total food requisition in the countryside was replaced by a food tax.', u"The stated purpose of the one-party state was to ensure that capitalist exploitation would not return to the Soviet Union and that the principles of democratic centralism would be most effective in representing the people's will in a practical manner.", u"Debate over the future of the economy provided the background for a power struggle in the years after Lenin's death in 1924.", u'Initially, Lenin was to be replaced by a "troika" consisting of Grigory Zinoviev of the Ukrainian SSR, Lev Kamenev of the Russian SFSR, and Joseph Stalin of the Transcaucasian SFSR.', u'On 3 April 1922, Stalin was named the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.', u"Lenin had appointed Stalin the head of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate, which gave Stalin considerable power.", u'By gradually consolidating his influence and isolating and outmaneuvering his rivals within the party, Stalin became the undisputed leader of the Soviet Union and, by the end of the 1920s, established totalitarian rule.', u'In October 1927, Grigory Zinoviev and Leon Trotsky were expelled from the Central Committee and forced into exile.', u'In 1928, Stalin introduced the First Five-Year Plan for building a socialist economy.', u'In place of the internationalism expressed by Lenin throughout the Revolution, it aimed to build Socialism in One Country.', u'In industry, the state assumed control over all existing enterprises and undertook an intensive program of industrialization.', u'In agriculture, rather than adhering to the "lead by example" policy advocated by Lenin, forced collectivization of farms was implemented all over the country.', u'Famines ensued, causing millions of deaths; surviving kulaks were persecuted and many sent to Gulags to do forced labour.', u'Social upheaval continued in the mid-1930s.', u'Stalin\'s Great Purge resulted in the execution or detainment of many "Old Bolsheviks" who had participated in the October Revolution with Lenin.', u'According to declassified Soviet archives, in 1937 and 1938, the NKVD arrested more than one and a half million people, of whom 681,692 were shot.', u'Over those two years that averages to over one thousand executions a day.', u'According to historian Geoffrey Hosking, "...excess deaths during the 1930s as a whole were in the range of 10\u201311 million."', u'Yet despite the turmoil of the mid-to-late 1930s, the Soviet Union developed a powerful industrial economy in the years before World War II.', u'==== 1930s ====\n\nThe early 1930s saw closer cooperation between the West and the USSR.', u'From 1932 to 1934, the Soviet Union participated in the World Disarmament Conference.', u"In 1933, diplomatic relations between the United States and the USSR were established when in November, the newly elected President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt chose to formally recognize Stalin's Communist government and negotiated a new trade agreement between the two nations.", u'In September 1934, the Soviet Union joined the League of Nations.', u'After the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, the USSR actively supported the Republican forces against the Nationalists, who were supported by Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany.', u'In December 1936, Stalin unveiled a new Soviet Constitution.', u'The constitution was seen as a personal triumph for Stalin, who on this occasion was described by Pravda as a "genius of the new world, the wisest man of the epoch, the great leader of communism."', u'By contrast, Western historians and historians from former Soviet occupied countries have viewed the constitution as a meaningless propaganda document.', u'The late 1930s saw a shift towards the Axis powers.', u'In 1939, almost a year after the United Kingdom and France had concluded the Munich Agreement with Germany, the USSR dealt with the Nazis as well, both militarily and economically during extensive talks.', u'The two countries concluded the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact and the German\u2013Soviet Commercial Agreement in August 1939.', u'The nonaggression pact made possible Soviet occupation of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Bessarabia, northern Bukovina, and eastern Poland.', u'In late November of the same year, unable to coerce the Republic of Finland by diplomatic means into moving its border 25 kilometres (16 mi) back from Leningrad, Joseph Stalin ordered the invasion of Finland.', u'In the east, the Soviet military won several decisive victories during border clashes with the Empire of Japan in 1938 and 1939.', u'However, in April 1941, USSR signed the Soviet\u2013Japanese Neutrality Pact with the Empire of Japan, recognizing the territorial integrity of Manchukuo, a Japanese puppet state.', u'==== World War II ====\n\nAlthough it has been debated whether the Soviet Union intended to invade Germany once it was strong enough, Germany itself broke the treaty and invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, starting what was known in the USSR as the "Great Patriotic War".', u'The Red Army stopped the seemingly invincible German Army at the Battle of Moscow, aided by an unusually harsh winter.', u'The Battle of Stalingrad, which lasted from late 1942 to early 1943, dealt a severe blow to the Germans from which they never fully recovered and became a turning point in the war.', u'After Stalingrad, Soviet forces drove through Eastern Europe to Berlin before Germany surrendered in 1945.', u'The German Army suffered 80% of its military deaths in the Eastern Front.', u'The same year, the USSR, in fulfillment of its agreement with the Allies at the Yalta Conference, denounced the Soviet\u2013Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1945 and invaded Manchukuo and other Japan-controlled territories on 9 August 1945.', u'This conflict ended with a decisive Soviet victory, contributing to the unconditional surrender of Japan and the end of World War II.', u'The Soviet Union suffered greatly in the war, losing around 27 million people.', u'During the war, the Soviet Union together with the United States, the United Kingdom and China were considered as the Big Four of Allied powers in World War II  and later became the Four Policemen which was the foundation of the United Nations Security Council.', u'It emerged as a superpower in the post-war period.', u'Once denied diplomatic recognition by the Western world, the Soviet Union had official relations with practically every nation by the late 1940s.', u'A member of the United Nations at its foundation in 1945, the Soviet Union became one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, which gave it the right to veto any of its resolutions.', u"The Soviet Union maintained its status as one of the world's two superpowers for four decades through its hegemony in Eastern Europe, military strength, economic strength, aid to developing countries, and scientific research, especially in space technology and weaponry.", u'==== Cold War ====\n\nDuring the immediate postwar period, the Soviet Union rebuilt and expanded its economy, while maintaining its strictly centralized control.', u'It aided post-war reconstruction in the countries of Eastern Europe, while turning them into satellite states, binding them in a military alliance (the Warsaw Pact) in 1955, and an economic organization (The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance or Comecon) from 1949 to 1991, the latter a counterpart to the European Economic Community.', u'Later, the Comecon supplied aid to the eventually victorious Communist Party of China, and saw its influence grow elsewhere in the world.', u"Fearing its ambitions, the Soviet Union's wartime allies, the United Kingdom and the United States, became its enemies.", u'In the ensuing Cold War, the two sides clashed indirectly using mostly proxies.', u'=== Khrushchev era ===\n\nStalin died on 5 March 1953.', u'Without a mutually agreeable successor, the highest Communist Party officials initially opted to rule the Soviet Union jointly through a troika.', u'This did not last, however, and Nikita Khrushchev eventually won the power struggle by the mid-1950s.', u"He shortly aftwerward denounced Stalin's use of repression in 1956 and proceeded to ease Stalin's repressive controls over party and society.", u'This was known as de-Stalinization.', u'Because Moscow considered Eastern Europe to be a critically vital buffer zone for the forward defense of its western borders (in case of another major invasion such as the German invasion of 1940), the USSR sought to cement its control of the region by transforming the Eastern European countries into satellite states dependent upon and subservient to its leadership.', u'Soviet military force was used to suppress anti-Stalinist uprisings in Hungary and Poland in 1956.', u"In the late 1950s, a confrontation with China regarding the USSR's rapprochement with the West and what Mao Zedong perceived as Khrushchev's revisionism led to the Sino\u2013Soviet split.", u'This resulted in a break throughout the global Marxist\u2013Leninist movement, with the governments in Albania, Cambodia and Somalia choosing to ally with China in place of the USSR.', u'During this period of the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Soviet Union continued to realize scientific and technological exploits in the Space Race, rivaling the United States: launching the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1 in 1957; a living dog named Laika in 1957; the first human being, Yuri Gagarin in 1961; the first woman in space, Valentina Tereshkova in 1963; Alexey Leonov, the first person to walk in space in 1965; the first soft landing on the moon by spacecraft Luna 9 in 1966 and the first moon rovers, Lunokhod 1 and Lunokhod 2.', u'Khrushchev initiated "The Thaw", a complex shift in political, cultural and economic life in the Soviet Union.', u'This included some openness and contact with other nations and new social and economic policies with more emphasis on commodity goods, allowing living standards to rise dramatically while maintaining high levels of economic growth.', u'Censorship was relaxed as well.', u"Khrushchev's reforms in agriculture and administration, however, were generally unproductive.", u'In 1962, he precipitated a crisis with the United States over the Soviet deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba.', u'An agreement was made between the Soviet Union and the United States to remove enemy nuclear missiles from both Cuba and Turkey, concluding the crisis.', u'This event caused Khrushchev much embarrassment and loss of prestige, resulting in his removal from power in 1964.', u'=== Brezhnev era ===\n\nFollowing the ousting of Khrushchev, another period of collective leadership ensued, consisting of Leonid Brezhnev as General Secretary, Alexei Kosygin as Premier and Nikolai Podgorny as Chairman of the Presidium, lasting until Brezhnev established himself in the early 1970s as the preeminent Soviet leader.', u'In 1968, the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact allies invaded Czechoslovakia to halt the Prague Spring reforms.', u'In the aftermath, Brezhnev justified the invasion along with the earlier invasions of Eastern European states by introducing the Brezhnev Doctrine, which claimed the right of the Soviet Union to violate the sovereignty of any country that attempted to replace Marxism\u2013Leninism with capitalism.', u'Brezhnev presided over a period of d\xe9tente with the West that resulted in treaties on armament control (SALT I, SALT II, Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty) while at the same time building up Soviet military might.', u'In October 1977, the third Soviet Constitution was unanimously adopted.', u"The prevailing mood of the Soviet leadership at the time of Brezhnev's death in 1982 was one of aversion to change.", u'The long period of Brezhnev\'s rule had come to be dubbed one of "standstill", with an aging and ossified top political leadership.', u"=== Gorbachev era ===\n\nTwo developments dominated the decade that followed: the increasingly apparent crumbling of the Soviet Union's economic and political structures, and the patchwork attempts at reforms to reverse that process.", u"Kenneth S. Deffeyes argued in Beyond Oil that the Reagan administration encouraged Saudi Arabia to lower the price of oil to the point where the Soviets could not make a profit selling their oil, so that the USSR's hard currency reserves became depleted.", u"Brezhnev's next two successors, transitional figures with deep roots in his tradition, did not last long.", u'Yuri Andropov was 68 years old and Konstantin Chernenko 72 when they assumed power; both died in less than two years.', u'In an attempt to avoid a third short-lived leader, in 1985, the Soviets turned to the next generation and selected Mikhail Gorbachev.', u'Gorbachev made significant changes in the economy and party leadership, called perestroika.', u'His policy of glasnost freed public access to information after decades of heavy government censorship.', u'Gorbachev also moved to end the Cold War.', u'In 1988, the Soviet Union abandoned its nine-year war in Afghanistan and began to withdraw its forces.', u"In the late 1980s, he refused military support to the Soviet Union's former satellite states, which paved the way for Revolutions of 1989.", u'With the tearing down of the Berlin Wall and with East Germany and West Germany pursuing unification, the Iron Curtain came down.', u'In the late 1980s, the constituent republics of the Soviet Union started legal moves towards potentially declaring sovereignty over their territories, citing Article 72 of the USSR constitution, which stated that any constituent republic was free to secede.', u'On 7 April 1990, a law was passed allowing a republic to secede if more than two-thirds of its residents voted for it in a referendum.', u'Many held their first free elections in the Soviet era for their own national legislatures in 1990.', u'Many of these legislatures proceeded to produce legislation contradicting the Union laws in what was known as the "War of Laws".', u"In 1989, the Russian SFSR, which was then the largest constituent republic (with about half of the population) convened a newly elected Congress of People's Deputies.", u'Boris Yeltsin was elected its chairman.', u"On 12 June 1990, the Congress declared Russia's sovereignty over its territory and proceeded to pass laws that attempted to supersede some of the USSR's laws.", u'After a landslide victory of S\u0105j\u016bdis in Lithuania, that country declared its independence restored on 11 March 1990.', u'A referendum for the preservation of the USSR was held on 17 March 1991 in nine republics (the remainder having boycotted the vote), with the majority of the population in those nine republics voting for preservation of the Union.', u'The referendum gave Gorbachev a minor boost.', u'In the summer of 1991, the New Union Treaty, which would have turned the Soviet Union into a much looser Union, was agreed upon by eight republics.', u"The signing of the treaty, however, was interrupted by the August Coup\u2014an attempted coup d'\xe9tat by hardline members of the government and the KGB who sought to reverse Gorbachev's reforms and reassert the central government's control over the republics.", u"After the coup collapsed, Yeltsin was seen as a hero for his decisive actions, while Gorbachev's power was effectively ended.", u'The balance of power tipped significantly towards the republics.', u"In August 1991, Latvia and Estonia immediately declared the restoration of their full independence (following Lithuania's 1990 example).", u"Gorbachev resigned as general secretary in late August, and soon afterward the Party's activities were indefinitely suspended\u2014effectively ending its rule.", u'By the fall, Gorbachev could no longer influence events outside of Moscow, and he was being challenged even there by Yeltsin, who had been elected President of Russia in July 1991.', u'=== Dissolution ===\n\nThe remaining 12 republics continued discussing new, increasingly looser, models of the Union.', u'However, by December, all except Russia and Kazakhstan had formally declared independence.', u'During this time, Yeltsin took over what remained of the Soviet government, including the Moscow Kremlin.', u'The final blow was struck on 1 December, when Ukraine, the second most powerful republic, voted overwhelmingly for independence.', u"Ukraine's secession ended any realistic chance of the Soviet Union staying together even on a limited scale.", u'On 8 December 1991, the presidents of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus (formerly Byelorussia), signed the Belavezha Accords, which declared the Soviet Union dissolved and established the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in its place.', u'While doubts remained over the authority of the accords to do this, on 21 December 1991, the representatives of all Soviet republics except Georgia signed the Alma-Ata Protocol, which confirmed the accords.', u'On 25 December 1991, Gorbachev resigned as the President of the USSR, declaring the office extinct.', u'He turned the powers that had been vested in the presidency over to Yeltsin.', u'That night, the Soviet flag was lowered for the last time, and the Russian tricolor was raised in its place.', u'The following day, the Supreme Soviet, the highest governmental body of the Soviet Union, voted both itself and the Soviet Union out of existence.', u'This is generally recognized as marking the official, final dissolution of the Soviet Union as a functioning state.', u'The Soviet Army originally remained under overall CIS command, but was soon absorbed into the different military forces of the newly independent states.', u'The few remaining Soviet institutions that had not been taken over by Russia ceased to function by the end of 1991.', u'Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991, Russia was internationally recognized as its legal successor on the international stage.', u'To that end, Russia voluntarily accepted all Soviet foreign debt and claimed overseas Soviet properties as its own.', u'Under the 1992 Lisbon Protocol, Russia also agreed to receive all nuclear weapons remaining in the territory of other former Soviet republics.', u"Since then, the Russian Federation has assumed the Soviet Union's rights and obligations.", u'Ukraine has refused to recognize exclusive Russian claims to succession of the USSR and claimed such status for Ukraine as well, which was codified in Articles 7 and 8 of its 1991 law On Legal Succession of Ukraine.', u'Since its independence in 1991 Ukraine has continued to pursue claims against Russia in foreign courts, seeking to recover its share of the foreign property that was owned by the Soviet Union.', u'The dissolution of the Soviet Union was followed by a severe economic contraction and catastrophic fall in living standards in post-Soviet states including a rapid increase in poverty, crime, corruption, unemployment, homelessness, rates of disease, and income inequality, along with decreases in calorie intake, life expectancy, adult literacy, and income.', u'The economic shocks that accompanied wholesale privatization were associated with sharp increases in mortality.', u'Data shows Russia, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia saw a tripling of unemployment and a 42% increase in male death rates between 1991 and 1994.', u'In summing up the international ramifications of these events, Vladislav Zubok stated: "The collapse of the Soviet empire was an event of epochal geopolitical, military, ideological, and economic significance. "', u'=== Post-Soviet states ===\n\nThe analysis of the succession of states with respect to the 15 post-Soviet states is complex.', u'The Russian Federation is seen as the legal continuator state and is for most purposes the heir to the Soviet Union.', u'It retained ownership of all former Soviet embassy properties, as well as the old Soviet UN membership and permanent membership on the Security Council.', u'The Baltic states are not successor states to the Soviet Union; they are instead considered to have de jure continuity with their pre-World War II governments through the non-recognition of the original Soviet incorporation in 1940.', u'The other 11 post-Soviet states are considered newly-independent successor states to the Soviet Union.', u'There are additionally four states that claim independence from the other internationally recognized post-Soviet states, but possess limited international recognition: Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh, South Ossetia, and Transnistria.', u'The Chechen separatist movement of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria lacks any international recognition.', u'== Politics ==\n\nThere were three power hierarchies in the Soviet Union: the legislature represented by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the government represented by the Council of Ministers, and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), the only legal party and the ultimate policymaker in the country.', u'=== Communist Party ===\n\nAt the top of the Communist Party was the Central Committee, elected at Party Congresses and Conferences.', u'The Central Committee in turn voted for a Politburo (called the Presidium between 1952\u20131966), Secretariat and the General Secretary (First Secretary from 1953 to 1966), the de facto highest office in the USSR.', u'Depending on the degree of power consolidation, it was either the Politburo as a collective body or the General Secretary, who always was one of the Politburo members, that effectively led the party and the country (except for the period of the highly personalized authority of Stalin, exercised directly through his position in the Council of Ministers rather than the Politburo after 1941).', u'They were not controlled by the general party membership, as the key principle of the party organization was democratic centralism, demanding strict subordination to higher bodies, and elections went uncontested, endorsing the candidates proposed from above.', u'The Communist Party maintained its dominance over the state largely through its control over the system of appointments.', u'All senior government officials and most deputies of the Supreme Soviet were members of the CPSU.', u'Of the party heads themselves, Stalin in 1941\u20131953 and Khrushchev in 1958\u20131964 were Premiers.', u'Upon the forced retirement of Khrushchev, the party leader was prohibited from this kind of double membership, but the later General Secretaries for at least some part of their tenure occupied the largely ceremonial position of Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the nominal head of state.', u'The institutions at lower levels were overseen and at times supplanted by primary party organizations.', u'In practice, however, the degree of control the party was able to exercise over the state bureaucracy, particularly after the death of Stalin, was far from total, with the bureaucracy pursuing different interests that were at times in conflict with the party.', u'Nor was the party itself monolithic from top to bottom, although factions were officially banned.', u'=== Government ===\n\nThe Supreme Soviet (successor of the Congress of Soviets and Central Executive Committee) was nominally the highest state body for most of the Soviet history, at first acting as a rubber stamp institution, approving and implementing all decisions made by the party.', u'However, the powers and functions of the Supreme Soviet were extended in the late 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, including the creation of new state commissions and committees.', u'It gained additional powers relating to the approval of the Five-Year Plans and the Soviet government budget.', u"The Supreme Soviet elected a Presidium to wield its power between plenary sessions, ordinarily held twice a year, and appointed the Supreme Court, the Procurator General and the Council of Ministers (known before 1946 as the Council of People's Commissars), headed by the Chairman (Premier) and managing an enormous bureaucracy responsible for the administration of the economy and society.", u'State and party structures of the constituent republics largely emulated the structure of the central institutions, although the Russian SFSR, unlike the other constituent republics, for most of its history had no republican branch of the CPSU, being ruled directly by the union-wide party until 1990.', u'Local authorities were organized likewise into party committees, local Soviets and executive committees.', u'While the state system was nominally federal, the party was unitary.', u'The state security police (the KGB and its predecessor agencies) played an important role in Soviet politics.', u'It was instrumental in the Stalinist terror, but after the death of Stalin, the state security police was brought under strict party control.', u'Under Yuri Andropov, KGB chairman in 1967\u20131982 and General Secretary from 1982 to 1983, the KGB engaged in the suppression of political dissent and maintained an extensive network of informers, reasserting itself as a political actor to some extent independent of the party-state structure, culminating in the anti-corruption campaign targeting high party officials in the late 1970s and early 1980s.', u'=== Separation of power and reform ===\n\nThe Union constitutions, which were promulgated in 1918, 1924, 1936 and 1977, did not limit state power.', u'No formal separation of powers existed between the Party, Supreme Soviet and Council of Ministers that represented executive and legislative branches of the government.', u'The system was governed less by statute than by informal conventions, and no settled mechanism of leadership succession existed.', u"Bitter and at times deadly power struggles took place in the Politburo after the deaths of Lenin and Joseph Stalin, as well as after Khrushchev's dismissal, itself due to a decision by both the Politburo and the Central Committee.", u'All leaders of the Communist Party before Gorbachev died in office, except Georgy Malenkov and Khrushchev, both dismissed from the party leadership amid internal struggle within the party.', u'Between 1988 and 1990, facing considerable opposition, Mikhail Gorbachev enacted reforms shifting power away from the highest bodies of the party and making the Supreme Soviet less dependent on them.', u"The Congress of People's Deputies was established, the majority of whose members were directly elected in competitive elections held in March 1989.", u'The Congress now elected the Supreme Soviet, which became a full-time parliament, much stronger than before.', u'For the first time since the 1920s, it refused to rubber stamp proposals from the party and Council of Ministers.', u'In 1990, Gorbachev introduced and assumed the position of the President of the Soviet Union, concentrated power in his executive office, independent of the party, and subordinated the government, now renamed the Cabinet of Ministers of the USSR, to himself.', u'Tensions grew between the union-wide authorities under Gorbachev, reformists led in Russia by Boris Yeltsin and controlling the newly elected Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR, and Communist Party hardliners.', u'On 19\u201321 August 1991, a group of hardliners staged an abortive coup attempt.', u'Following the failed coup, the State Council of the Soviet Union became the highest organ of state power "in the period of transition".', u'Gorbachev resigned as General Secretary, only remaining President for the final months of the existence of the USSR.', u'=== Judicial system ===\n\nThe judiciary was not independent of the other branches of government.', u"The Supreme Court supervised the lower courts (People's Court) and applied the law as established by the Constitution or as interpreted by the Supreme Soviet.", u'The Constitutional Oversight Committee reviewed the constitutionality of laws and acts.', u'The Soviet Union used the inquisitorial system of Roman law, where the judge, procurator, and defense attorney collaborate to establish the truth.', u'== Administrative divisions ==\n\nConstitutionally, the USSR was a federation of constituent Union Republics, which were either unitary states, such as Ukraine or Byelorussia (SSRs), or federal states, such as Russia or Transcaucasia (SFSRs), all four being the founding republics who signed the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR in December 1922.', u"In 1924, during the national delimitation in Central Asia, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan were formed from parts of the Russia's Turkestan ASSR and two Soviet dependencies, the Khorezm and Bukharan SSRs.", u'In 1929, Tajikistan was split off from the Uzbekistan.', u'With the constitution of 1936, the Transcaucasian SFSR was dissolved, resulting in its constituent republics of Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan being elevated to Union Republics, while Kazakhstan and Kirghizia were split off from Russian SFSR, resulting in the same status.', u'In August 1940, Moldavia was formed from parts of the Ukraine and Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina.', u'Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania (SSRs) were also admitted into the union which was not recognized by most of the international community and was considered an illegal occupation.', u'Karelia was split off from Russia as a Union Republic in March 1940 and was reabsorbed in 1956.', u'Between July 1956 and September 1991, there were 15 union republics (see map below).', u'While nominally a union of equals, in practice the Soviet Union was dominated by the Russian SFSR\u2014to such an extent that for most of the Soviet Union\'s existence, it was commonly (but incorrectly) referred to as "Russia."', u'While the RSFSR was technically only one republic within the larger union, it was by far the largest (both in terms of population and geography), most powerful, and most highly developed.', u'Historian Matthew White wrote that it was an open secret that the Soviet Union\'s federal structure was "window dressing" for Russian dominance.', u'For that reason, the people of the Soviet Union were usually called "Russians," not "Soviets," since "everyone knew who really ran the show."', u'== Economy ==\n\nThe Soviet Union became the first country to adopt a planned economy, whereby production and distribution of goods were centralized and directed by the government.', u'The first Bolshevik experience with a command economy was the policy of War communism, which involved the nationalization of industry, centralized distribution of output, coercive requisition of agricultural production, and attempts to eliminate the circulation of money, as well as private enterprises and free trade.', u'After the severe economic collapse caused by the war, Lenin replaced War Communism with the New Economic Policy (NEP) in 1921, legalising free trade and private ownership of smaller businesses.', u'The economy quickly recovered.', u'Following a lengthy debate among the members of Politburo over the course of economic development, by 1928\u20131929, upon gaining control of the country, Joseph Stalin abandoned the NEP and pushed for full central planning, starting forced collectivization of agriculture and enacting draconian labor legislation.', u'Resources were mobilized for rapid industrialization, which greatly expanded Soviet capacity in heavy industry and capital goods during the 1930s.', u'Preparation for war was one of the main driving forces behind industrialization, mostly due to distrust of the outside capitalistic world.', u'As a result, the USSR was transformed from a largely agrarian economy into a great industrial power, leading the way for its emergence as a superpower after World War II.', u'During the war, the Soviet economy and infrastructure suffered massive devastation and required extensive reconstruction.', u'By the early 1940s, the Soviet economy had become relatively self-sufficient; for most of the period until the creation of Comecon, only a very small share of domestic products was traded internationally.', u'After the creation of the Eastern Bloc, external trade rose rapidly.', u'Still the influence of the world economy on the USSR was limited by fixed domestic prices and a state monopoly on foreign trade.', u'Grain and sophisticated consumer manufactures became major import articles from around the 1960s.', u'During the arms race of the Cold War, the Soviet economy was burdened by military expenditures, heavily lobbied for by a powerful bureaucracy dependent on the arms industry.', u'At the same time, the Soviet Union became the largest arms exporter to the Third World.', u'Significant amounts of Soviet resources during the Cold War were allocated in aid to the other socialist states.', u'From the 1930s until its dissolution in late 1991, the way the Soviet economy operated remained essentially unchanged.', u'The economy was formally directed by central planning, carried out by Gosplan and organized in five-year plans.', u'In practice, however, the plans were highly aggregated and provisional, subject to ad hoc intervention by superiors.', u'All key economic decisions were taken by the political leadership.', u'Allocated resources and plan targets were normally denominated in rubles rather than in physical goods.', u'Credit was discouraged, but widespread.', u'Final allocation of output was achieved through relatively decentralized, unplanned contracting.', u'Although in theory prices were legally set from above, in practice the actual prices were often negotiated, and informal horizontal links (between producer factories etc.)', u'were widespread.', u'A number of basic services were state-funded, such as education and healthcare.', u'In the manufacturing sector, heavy industry and defense were assigned higher priority than the production of consumer goods.', u'Consumer goods, particularly outside large cities, were often scarce, of poor quality and limited choice.', u'Under command economy, consumers had almost no influence over production, so the changing demands of a population with growing incomes could not be satisfied by supplies at rigidly fixed prices.', u'A massive unplanned second economy grew up alongside the planned one at low levels, providing some of the goods and services that the planners could not.', u'Legalization of some elements of the decentralized economy was attempted with the reform of 1965.', u'Although statistics of the Soviet economy are notoriously unreliable and its economic growth difficult to estimate precisely, by most accounts, the economy continued to expand until the mid-1980s.', u'During the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet economy experienced comparatively high growth and was catching up to the West.', u'However, after 1970, the growth, while still positive, steadily declined much more quickly and consistently than in other countries despite a rapid increase in the capital stock (the rate of increase in capital was only surpassed by Japan).', u'Overall, between 1960 and 1989, the growth rate of per capita income in the Soviet Union was slightly above the world average (based on 102 countries).', u'According to Stanley Fischer and William Easterly, growth could have been faster.', u'By their calculation, per capita income of Soviet Union in 1989 should have been twice as high as it was considering the amount of investment, education and population.', u'The authors attribute this poor performance to low productivity of capital in the Soviet Union.', u"Steven Rosenfielde states that the standard of living actually declined as a result of Stalin's despotism, and while there was a brief improvement following his death, lapsed into stagnation.", u'In 1987, Mikhail Gorbachev tried to reform and revitalize the economy with his program of perestroika.', u'His policies relaxed state control over enterprises, but did not yet allow it to be replaced by market incentives, ultimately resulting in a sharp decline in production output.', u'The economy, already suffering from reduced petroleum export revenues, started to collapse.', u'Prices were still fixed, and property was still largely state-owned until after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.', u'For most of the period after World War II up to its collapse, the Soviet economy was the second largest in the world by GDP (PPP), and was 3rd in the world during the middle of the 1980s to 1989, though in per capita terms the Soviet GDP was behind that of the First World countries.', u'When compared to countries who had a similar GDP per capita to the Soviet Union in 1928, the Soviets experienced significant growth.', u'In 1990, the Soviet Union had a Human Development Index of 0.920, placing them in the "high" category of human development.', u'They had the third highest in the Eastern Bloc, behind Czechoslovakia and East Germany, and the twenty-fifth highest in the world out of one hundred-thirty countries in total.', u'=== Energy ===\n\nThe need for fuel declined in the Soviet Union from the 1970s to the 1980s, both per ruble of gross social product and per ruble of industrial product.', u'At the start, this decline grew very rapidly but gradually slowed down between 1970 and 1975.', u'From 1975 and 1980, it grew even slower, only 2.6 percent.', u'David Wilson, a historian, believed that the gas industry would account for 40 percent of Soviet fuel production by the end of the century.', u"His theory did not come to fruition because of the USSR's collapse.", u'The USSR, in theory, would have continued to have an economic growth rate of 2\u20132.5 percent during the 1990s because of Soviet energy fields.', u"However, the energy sector faced many difficulties, among them the country's high military expenditure and hostile relations with the First World (pre-Gorbachev era).", u'In 1991, the Soviet Union had a pipeline network of 82,000 kilometres (51,000 mi) for crude oil and another 206,500 kilometres (128,300 mi) for natural gas.', u'Petroleum and petroleum-based products, natural gas, metals, wood, agricultural products, and a variety of manufactured goods, primarily machinery, arms and military equipment, were exported.', u'In the 1970s and 1980s, the Soviet Union heavily relied on fossil fuel exports to earn hard currency.', u'At its peak in 1988, it was the largest producer and second largest exporter of crude oil, surpassed only by Saudi Arabia.', u"=== Science and technology ===\n\nThe Soviet Union placed great emphasis on science and technology within its economy, however, the most remarkable Soviet successes in technology, such as producing the world's first space satellite, typically were the responsibility of the military.", u'Lenin believed that the USSR would never overtake the developed world if it remained as technologically backward as it was upon its founding.', u"Soviet authorities proved their commitment to Lenin's belief by developing massive networks, research and development organizations.", u'In the early 1960s, the Soviets awarded 40% of chemistry PhDs to women, compared to only 5% who received such a degree in the United States.', u"By 1989, Soviet scientists were among the world's best-trained specialists in several areas, such as energy physics, selected areas of medicine, mathematics, welding and military technologies.", u'Due to rigid state planning and bureaucracy, the Soviets remained far behind technologically in chemistry, biology, and computers when compared to the First World.', u'Project Socrates, under the Reagan administration, determined that the Soviet Union addressed the acquisition of science and technology in a manner that was radically different from what the US was using.', u'In the case of the US, economic prioritization was being used for indigenous research and development as the means to acquire science and technology in both the private and public sectors.', u'In contrast, the Soviet Union was offensively and defensively maneuvering in the acquisition and utilization of the worldwide technology, to increase the competitive advantage that they acquired from the technology, while preventing the US from acquiring a competitive advantage.', u"However, in addition, the Soviet Union's technology-based planning was executed in a centralized, government-centric manner that greatly hindered its flexibility.", u'It was this significant lack of flexibility that was exploited by the US to undermine the strength of the Soviet Union and thus foster its reform.', u"=== Transport ===\n\nTransport was a key component of the nation's economy.", u'The economic centralization of the late 1920s and 1930s led to the development of infrastructure on a massive scale, most notably the establishment of Aeroflot, an aviation enterprise.', u'The country had a wide variety of modes of transport by land, water and air.', u'However, due to bad maintenance, much of the road, water and Soviet civil aviation transport were outdated and technologically backward compared to the First World.', u'Soviet rail transport was the largest and most intensively used in the world; it was also better developed than most of its Western counterparts.', u'By the late 1970s and early 1980s, Soviet economists were calling for the construction of more roads to alleviate some of the burden from the railways and to improve the Soviet government budget.', u'The street network and automotive industry remained underdeveloped, and dirt roads were common outside major cities.', u'Soviet maintenance projects proved unable to take care of even the few roads the country had.', u'By the early-to-mid-1980s, the Soviet authorities tried to solve the road problem by ordering the construction of new ones.', u'Meanwhile, the automobile industry was growing at a faster rate than road construction.', u'The underdeveloped road network led to a growing demand for public transport.', u'Despite improvements, several aspects of the transport sector were still riddled with problems due to outdated infrastructure, lack of investment, corruption and bad decision-making.', u'Soviet authorities were unable to meet the growing demand for transport infrastructure and services.', u'The Soviet merchant navy was one of the largest in the world.', u'== Demographics ==\n\nExcess deaths over the course of World War I and the Russian Civil War (including the postwar famine) amounted to a combined total of 18 million, some 10 million in the 1930s, and more than 26 million in 1941\u20135.', u'The postwar Soviet population was 45 to 50 million smaller than it would have been if pre-war demographic growth had continued.', u'According to Catherine Merridale, "... reasonable estimate would place the total number of excess deaths for the whole period somewhere around 60 million."', u'The birth rate of the USSR decreased from 44.0 per thousand in 1926 to 18.0 in 1974, largely due to increasing urbanization and the rising average age of marriages.', u'The mortality rate demonstrated a gradual decrease as well \u2013 from 23.7 per thousand in 1926 to 8.7 in 1974.', u'In general, the birth rates of the southern republics in Transcaucasia and Central Asia were considerably higher than those in the northern parts of the Soviet Union, and in some cases even increased in the post\u2013World War II period, a phenomenon partly attributed to slower rates of urbanization and traditionally earlier marriages in the southern republics.', u'Soviet Europe moved towards sub-replacement fertility, while Soviet Central Asia continued to exhibit population growth well above replacement-level fertility.', u'The late 1960s and the 1970s witnessed a reversal of the declining trajectory of the rate of mortality in the USSR, and was especially notable among men of working age, but was also prevalent in Russia and other predominantly Slavic areas of the country.', u'An analysis of the official data from the late 1980s showed that after worsening in the late-1970s and the early 1980s, adult mortality began to improve again.', u'The infant mortality rate increased from 24.7 in 1970 to 27.9 in 1974.', u'Some researchers regarded the rise as largely real, a consequence of worsening health conditions and services.', u'The rises in both adult and infant mortality were not explained or defended by Soviet officials, and the Soviet government simply stopped publishing all mortality statistics for ten years.', u'Soviet demographers and health specialists remained silent about the mortality increases until the late-1980s, when the publication of mortality data resumed and researchers could delve into the real causes.', u'=== Education ===\n\nBefore 1917, education was not free in the Russian Empire and was therefore either inaccessible or barely accessible for many children from lower-class working and peasant families.', u'Estimates from 1917 recorded that 75\u201385 percent of the Russian population was illiterate.', u"Anatoly Lunacharsky became the first People's Commissar for Education of Soviet Russia.", u'At the beginning, the Soviet authorities placed great emphasis on the elimination of illiteracy.', u'People who were literate were automatically hired as teachers.', u'For a short period, quality was sacrificed for quantity.', u'By 1940, Joseph Stalin could announce that illiteracy had been eliminated.', u'Throughout the 1930s social mobility rose sharply, which has been attributed to Soviet reforms in education.', u"In the aftermath of the Great Patriotic War, the country's educational system expanded dramatically.", u'This expansion had a tremendous effect.', u'In the 1960s, nearly all Soviet children had access to education, the only exception being those living in remote areas.', u'Nikita Khrushchev tried to make education more accessible, making it clear to children that education was closely linked to the needs of society.', u'Education also became important in giving rise to the New Man.', u'Citizens directly entering the work force had the constitutional right to a job and to free vocational training.', u"The country's system of education was highly centralized and universally accessible to all citizens, with affirmative action for applicants from nations associated with cultural backwardness.", u'However, as part of the general antisemitic policy, an unofficial Jewish quota was applied in the leading institutions of higher education by subjecting Jewish applicants to harsher entrance examinations.', u'The Brezhnev era also introduced a rule that required all university applicants to present a reference from the local Komsomol party secretary.', u'According to statistics from 1986, the number of higher education students per the population of 10,000 was 181 for the USSR, compared to 517 for the U.S.\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nThe Soviet Union was a very ethnically diverse country, with more than 100 distinct ethnic groups.', u'The total population was estimated at 293 million in 1991.', u'According to a 1990 estimate, the majority were Russians (50.78%), followed by Ukrainians (15.45%) and Uzbeks (5.84%).', u'All citizens of the USSR had their own ethnic affiliation.', u"The ethnicity of a person was chosen at the age of sixteen by the child's parents.", u'If the parents did not agree, the child was automatically assigned the ethnicity of the father.', u'Partly due to Soviet policies, some of the smaller minority ethnic groups were considered part of larger ones, such as the Mingrelians of Georgia, who were classified with the linguistically related Georgians.', u'Some ethnic groups voluntarily assimilated, while others were brought in by force.', u'Russians, Belarusians, and Ukrainians shared close cultural ties, while other groups did not.', u'With multiple nationalities living in the same territory, ethnic antagonisms developed over the years.', u'=== Health ===\n\nIn 1917, before the revolution, health conditions were significantly behind those of developed countries.', u'As Lenin later noted, "Either the lice will defeat socialism, or socialism will defeat the lice".', u"The Soviet principle of health care was conceived by the People's Commissariat for Health in 1918.", u'Health care was to be controlled by the state and would be provided to its citizens free of charge, this at the time being a revolutionary concept.', u'Article 42 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution gave all citizens the right to health protection and free access to any health institutions in the USSR.', u'Before Leonid Brezhnev became General Secretary, the healthcare system of the Soviet Union was held in high esteem by many foreign specialists.', u"This changed however, from Brezhnev's accession and Mikhail Gorbachev's tenure as leader, the Soviet health care system was heavily criticized for many basic faults, such as the quality of service and the unevenness in its provision.", u"Minister of Health Yevgeniy Chazov, during the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, while highlighting such Soviet successes as having the most doctors and hospitals in the world, recognized the system's areas for improvement and felt that billions of Soviet rubles were squandered.", u'After the socialist revolution, the life expectancy for all age groups went up.', u'This statistic in itself was seen by some that the socialist system was superior to the capitalist system.', u'These improvements continued into the 1960s, when the life expectancy in the Soviet Union surpassed that of the United States.', u'It remained stable during most years, although in the 1970s, it went down slightly, possibly because of alcohol abuse.', u'At the same time, infant mortality began to rise.', u'After 1974, the government stopped publishing statistics on this.', u'This trend can be partly explained by the number of pregnancies rising drastically in the Asian part of the country where infant mortality was highest, while declining markedly in the more developed European part of the Soviet Union.', u'The USSR had several centers of excellence, such as the Fyodorov Eye Microsurgery Complex, founded in 1988 by Russian eye surgeon Svyatoslav Fyodorov.', u'=== Language ===\n\nThe Soviet government headed by Vladimir Lenin gave small language groups their own writing systems.', u'The development of these writing systems was very successful, even though some flaws were detected.', u'During the later days of the USSR, countries with the same multilingual situation implemented similar policies.', u'A serious problem when creating these writing systems was that the languages differed dialectally greatly from each other.', u'When a language had been given a writing system and appeared in a notable publication, that language would attain "official language" status.', u'There were many minority languages which never received their own writing system; therefore their speakers were forced to have a second language.', u"There are examples where the Soviet government retreated from this policy, most notable under Stalin's regime, where education was discontinued in languages which were not widespread enough.", u'These languages were then assimilated into another language, mostly Russian.', u'During the Great Patriotic War, some minority languages were banned, and their speakers accused of collaborating with the enemy.', u'As the most widely spoken of the Soviet Union\'s many languages, Russian de facto functioned as an official language, as the "language of interethnic communication" (Russian: \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a \u043c\u0435\u0436\u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f), but only assumed the de jure status as the official national language in 1990.', u'=== Religion ===\n\nThe religious made up a significant minority of the Soviet Union prior to break up.', u'In 1990, the religious makeup was 20% Russian Orthodox, 10% Muslim, 7% Protestant, Armenian Apostolic, Georgian Orthodox, and Roman Catholic, less than 1% Jewish and 60% atheist.', u"Christianity and Islam had the greatest number of adherents among the Soviet state's religious citizens.", u"Eastern Christianity predominated among Christians, with Russia's traditional Russian Orthodox Church being the Soviet Union's largest Christian denomination.", u"About 90 percent of the Soviet Union's Muslims were Sunnis, with Shias concentrated in Azerbaijan.", u'Smaller groups included Roman Catholics, Jews, Buddhists, and a variety of Protestant sects.', u'Religious influence had been strong in the Russian Empire.', u'The Russian Orthodox Church enjoyed a privileged status as the church of the monarchy and took part in carrying out official state functions.', u'The immediate period following the establishment of the Soviet state included a struggle against the Orthodox Church, which the revolutionaries considered an ally of the former ruling classes.', u'In Soviet law, the "freedom to hold religious services" was constitutionally guaranteed, although the ruling Communist Party regarded religion as incompatible with the Marxist spirit of scientific materialism.', u'In practice, the Soviet system subscribed to a narrow interpretation of this right, and in fact utilized a range of official measures to discourage religion and curb the activities of religious groups.', u'The 1918 Council of People\'s Commissars decree establishing the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) as a secular state also decreed that "the teaching of religion in all [places] where subjects of general instruction are taught, is forbidden.', u'Citizens may teach and may be taught religion privately."', u"Among further restrictions, those adopted in 1929, a half-decade into Stalin's rule, included express prohibitions on a range of church activities, including meetings for organized Bible study.", u'Both Christian and non-Christian establishments were shut down by the thousands in the 1920s and 1930s.', u'By 1940, as many as 90 percent of the churches, synagogues, and mosques that had been operating in 1917 were closed.', u'Convinced that religious anti-Sovietism had become a thing of the past with most Soviet Christians, and with the looming threat of war, the Stalin regime began shifting to a more moderate religion policy in the late 1930s.', u'Soviet religious establishments overwhelmingly rallied to support the war effort during the Soviet war with Nazi Germany.', u'Amid other accommodations to religious faith after Hitler attacked the Soviet Union, churches were reopened, Radio Moscow began broadcasting a religious hour, and a historic meeting between Stalin and Orthodox Church leader Patriarch Sergius of Moscow was held in 1943.', u'Stalin had the support of the majority of the religious people in the Soviet Union even through the late 1980s.', u'The general tendency of this period was an increase in religious activity among believers of all faiths.', u"The Soviet establishment under General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev's leadership clashed with the churches in 1958\u20131964, a period when atheism was emphasized in the educational curriculum, and numerous state publications promoted atheistic views.", u'During this period, the number of churches fell from 20,000 to 10,000 from 1959 to 1965, and the number of synagogues dropped from 500 to 97.', u'The number of working mosques also declined, falling from 1,500 to 500 within a decade.', u'Religious institutions remained monitored by the Soviet government, but churches, synagogues, temples, and mosques were all given more leeway in the Brezhnev era.', u'Official relations between the Orthodox Church and the Soviet government again warmed to the point that the Brezhnev government twice honored Orthodox Patriarch Alexy I with the Order of the Red Banner of Labour.', u'A poll conducted by Soviet authorities in 1982 recorded 20 percent of the Soviet population as "active religious believers."', u'=== Women ===\n\nSoviet efforts to expand social, political and economic opportunities for women constitute "the earliest and perhaps most far-reaching attempt ever undertaken to transform the status and role of women."', u"== Culture ==\n\nThe culture of the Soviet Union passed through several stages during the USSR's 69-year existence.", u'During the first eleven years following the Revolution (1918\u20131929), there was relative freedom and artists experimented with several different styles to find a distinctive Soviet style of art.', u'Lenin wanted art to be accessible to the Russian people.', u'On the other hand, hundreds of intellectuals, writers, and artists were exiled or executed, and their work banned, for example Nikolay Gumilyov (shot for alleged conspiring against the Bolshevik regime) and Yevgeny Zamyatin (banned).', u'The government encouraged a variety of trends.', u'In art and literature,

it is often called the "Big Island" or "Hawai\u02bbi Island" to avoid confusion with the state or archipelago.', u'The archipelago is physiographically and ethnologically part of the Polynesian subregion of Oceania.', u"Hawaii's diverse natural scenery, warm tropical climate, abundance of public beaches, oceanic surroundings, and active volcanoes make it a popular destination for tourists, surfers, biologists, and volcanologists.", u"Because of its central location in the Pacific and 19th-century labor migration, Hawaii's culture is strongly influenced by North American and Asian cultures, in addition to its indigenous Hawaiian culture.", u'Hawaii has over a million permanent residents, along with many visitors and U.S. military personnel.', u'Its capital is Honolulu on the island of O\u02bbahu.', u'Hawaii is the 8th-smallest and the 11th-least populous, but the 13th-most densely populated of the fifty U.S. states.', u'It is the only state with an Asian plurality.', u"The state's coastline is about 750 miles (1,210 km) long, the fourth longest in the U.S. after the coastlines of Alaska, Florida and California.", u'The Hawaiian sovereignty movement, which generally views the overthrow of Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893 and its subsequent annexation by the United States as illegal, seeks some form of greater autonomy for Hawaii, such as free association or independence from the United States.', u'== Etymology ==\nThe state of Hawaii derives its name from the name of its largest island, Hawai\u02bbi.', u'A common Hawaiian explanation of the name of Hawai\u02bbi is that was named for Hawai\u02bbiloa, a legendary figure from Hawaiian myth.', u'He is said to have discovered the islands when they were first settled.', u'The Hawaiian language word Hawai\u02bbi is very similar to Proto-Polynesian *Sawaiki, with the reconstructed meaning "homeland".', u'Cognates of Hawai\u02bbi are found in other Polynesian languages, including M\u0101ori (Hawaiki), Rarotongan (\u02bbAvaiki) and Samoan (Savai\u02bbi) .', u'According to linguists Pukui and Elbert, "[e]lsewhere in Polynesia, Hawai\u02bbi or a cognate is the name of the underworld or of the ancestral home, but in Hawaii, the name has no meaning".', u'=== Spelling of state name ===\nA somewhat divisive political issue arose in 1978 when the Constitution of the State of Hawaii added Hawaiian as a second official state language.', u'The title of the state constitution is The Constitution of the State of Hawaii.', u'Article XV, Section 1 of the Constitution uses The State of Hawaii.', u'Diacritics were not used because the document, drafted in 1949, predates the use of the okina (\u02bb) and the kahak\u014d in modern Hawaiian orthography.', u"The exact spelling of the state's name in the Hawaiian language is Hawai\u02bbi.", u'In the Hawaii Admission Act that granted Hawaiian statehood, the federal government recognized Hawaii as the official state name.', u'Official government publications, department and office titles, and the Seal of Hawaii use the traditional spelling with no symbols for glottal stops or vowel length.', u'In contrast, the National and State Parks Services, the University of Hawai\u02bbi and some private enterprises implement these symbols.', u'No precedent for changes to U.S. state names exists since the adoption of the United States Constitution in 1789.', u'However, the Constitution of Massachusetts formally changed the Province of Massachusetts Bay to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1780, and in the 1819 the Territory of Arkansaw was created but was later admitted to statehood as State of Arkansas.', u'== Geography and environment ==\n\nThere are eight main Hawaiian islands, seven of which are permanently inhabited.', u"The island of Ni\u02bbihau is privately managed by brothers Bruce and Keith Robinson; access is restricted to those who have permission from the island's owners.", u'=== Topography ===\n\nThe Hawaiian archipelago is located 2,000 mi (3,200 km) southwest of the continental United States.', u'Hawaii is the southernmost U.S. state and the second westernmost after Alaska.', u'Hawaii, along with Alaska, does not border any other U.S. state.', u'It is the only U.S. state that is not geographically located in North America, the only state completely surrounded by water and that is entirely an archipelago, and the only state in which coffee is cultivable.', u'In addition to the eight main islands, the state has many smaller islands and islets.', u'Ka\u02bbula is a small island near Ni\u02bbihau that is often overlooked.', u'The Northwest Hawaiian Islands is a group of nine small, older islands to the northwest of Kaua\u02bbi that extend from Nihoa to Kure Atoll; these are remnants of once much larger volcanic mountains.', u'Across the archipelago are around 130 small rocks and islets, such as Molokini, which are either volcanic, marine sedimentary or erosional in origin.', u"Hawaii's tallest mountain Mauna Kea is 13,796 ft (4,205 m) above mean sea level; it is taller than Mount Everest if measured from the base of the mountain, which lies on the floor of the Pacific Ocean and rises about 33,500 feet (10,200 m).", u'=== Geology ===\n\nThe Hawaiian islands were formed by volcanic activity initiated at an undersea magma source called the Hawaii hotspot.', u'The process is continuing to build islands; the tectonic plate beneath much of the Pacific Ocean continually moves northwest and the hot spot remains stationary, slowly creating new volcanoes.', u"Because of the hotspot's location, all currently active land volcanoes are located on the southern half of Hawaii Island.", u'The newest volcano, L\u014d\u02bbihi Seamount, is located south of the coast of Hawaii Island.', u'The last volcanic eruption outside Hawaii Island occurred at Haleakal\u0101 on Maui before the late 18th century, though it could have been hundreds of years earlier.', u'In 1790, K\u012blauea exploded; it was the deadliest eruption known to have occurred in the modern era in what is now the United States.', u'Up to 5,405 warriors and their families marching on K\u012blauea were killed by the eruption.', u'Volcanic activity and subsequent erosion have created impressive geological features.', u"Hawaii Island has the third-highest point among the world's islands.", u'On the flanks of the volcanoes, slope instability has generated damaging earthquakes and related tsunamis, particularly in 1868 and 1975.', u'Steep cliffs have been created by catastrophic debris avalanches on the submerged flanks of ocean island volcanoes.', u'=== Flora and fauna ===\n\nBecause the islands of Hawaii are distant from other land habitats, life is thought to have arrived there by wind, waves (i.e.', u'by ocean currents) and wings (i.e.', u'birds, insects, and any seeds they may have carried on their feathers).', u'This isolation, in combination with the diverse environment (including extreme altitudes, tropical climates, and arid shorelines), produced an array of endemic flora and fauna.', u'Hawaii has more endangered species and has lost a higher percentage of its endemic species than any other U.S. state.', u'One endemic plant, Brighamia, now requires hand-pollination because its natural pollinator is presumed to be extinct.', u'The two species of Brighamia\u2014B.', u'rockii and B. insignis\u2014are represented in the wild by around 120 individual plants.', u'To ensure these plants set seed, biologists rappel down 3,000-foot (910 m) cliffs to brush pollen onto their stigmas.', u'The extant main islands of the archipelago have been above the surface of the ocean for fewer than 10 million years; a fraction of the time biological colonization and evolution have occurred there.', u'The islands are well known for the environmental diversity that occurs on high mountains within a trade winds field.', u'On a single island, the climate around the coasts can range from dry tropical (less than 20 inches or 510 millimetres annual rainfall) to wet tropical; on the slopes, environments range from tropical rainforest (more than 200 inches or 5,100 millimetres per year), through a temperate climate, to alpine conditions with a cold, dry climate.', u'The rainy climate impacts soil development, which largely determines ground permeability, affecting the distribution of streams and wetlands.', u'=== Protected areas ===\n\nSeveral areas in Hawaii are under the protection of the National Park Service.', u'Hawaii has two national parks: Haleakal\u0101 National Park located near Kula on the island of Maui, which features the dormant volcano Haleakal\u0101 that formed east Maui, and Hawaii Volcanoes National Park in the southeast region of the Hawai\u02bbi Island, which includes the active volcano K\u012blauea and its rift zones.', u"There are three national historical parks; Kalaupapa National Historical Park in Kalaupapa, Moloka\u02bbi, the site of a former leper colony; Kaloko-Honok\u014dhau National Historical Park in Kailua-Kona on Hawai\u02bbi Island; and Pu\u02bbuhonua o H\u014dnaunau National Historical Park, an ancient place of refuge on Hawai\u02bbi Island's west coast.", u'Other areas under the control of the National Park Service include Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail on Hawai\u02bbi Island and the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor on O\u02bbahu.', u'The Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument was proclaimed by President George W. Bush on June 15, 2006.', u'The monument covers roughly 140,000 square miles (360,000 km2) of reefs, atolls, and shallow and deep sea out to 50 miles (80 km) offshore in the Pacific Ocean\u2014an area larger than all of the national parks in the U.S. combined.', u"=== Climate ===\n\nHawaii's climate is typical for the tropics, although temperatures and humidity tend to be less extreme because of near-constant trade winds from the east.", u'Summer highs usually reach around 88 \xb0F (31 \xb0C) during the day, with the temperature reaching a low of 75 \xb0F (24 \xb0C) at night.', u'Winter day temperatures are usually around 83 \xb0F (28 \xb0C); at low elevation they seldom dip below 65 \xb0F (18 \xb0C) at night.', u'Snow, not usually associated with the tropics, falls at 13,800 feet (4,200 m) on Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa on Hawaii Island in some winter months.', u'Snow rarely falls on Haleakal\u0101.', u'Mount Wai\u02bbale\u02bbale on Kaua\u02bbi has the second-highest average annual rainfall on Earth, about 460 inches (12,000 mm) per year.', u'Most of Hawaii experiences only two seasons; the dry season runs from May to October and the wet season is from October to April.', u'The warmest temperature recorded in the state, in Pahala on April 27, 1931, is 100 \xb0F (38 \xb0C), making it tied with Alaska as the lowest record high temperature observed in a U.S. state.', u"Hawaii's record low temperature is 12 \xb0F (\u221211 \xb0C) observed in May 1979 on the summit of Mauna Kea.", u'Hawaii is the only state to have never recorded sub-zero Fahrenheit temperatures.', u'Climates vary considerably on each island; they can be divided into windward and leeward (ko\u02bbolau and kona, respectively) areas based upon location relative to the higher mountains.', u'Windward sides face cloud cover.', u'== History ==\n\nHawaii is one of four U.S. states\u2014apart from the original thirteen\u2014the Vermont Republic (1791), the Republic of Texas (1845), and the California Republic (1846)\u2014that were independent nations prior to statehood.', u'Along with Texas, Hawaii had formal, international diplomatic recognition as a nation.', u"The Kingdom of Hawai\u02bbi was sovereign from 1810 until 1893 when the monarchy was overthrown by resident American and European capitalists and landholders in a coup d'\xe9tat.", u'Hawaii was an independent republic from 1894 until August 12, 1898, when it officially became a territory of the United States.', u'Hawaii was admitted as a U.S. state on August 21, 1959.', u'=== First human settlement \u2013 Ancient Hawai\u02bbi (800\u20131778) ===\n\nBased on archaeological evidence, the earliest habitation of the Hawaiian Islands dates to around 300 CE, probably by Polynesian settlers from the Marquesas Islands.', u'A second wave of migration from Raiatea and Bora Bora took place in the 11th century.', u'The date of the human discovery and habitation of the Hawaiian Islands is the subject of academic debate.', u'Some archaeologists and historians believe there was an early settlement from the Marquesas.', u'They think it was a later wave of immigrants from Tahiti around 1000 CE who introduced a new line of high chiefs, the kapu system, the practice of human sacrifice, and the building of heiau.', u'This later immigration is detailed in Hawaiian mythology (mo\u02bbolelo) about Pa\u02bbao.', u'Other authors say there is no archaeological or linguistic evidence for a later influx of Tahitian settlers and that Pa\u02bbao must be regarded as a myth.', u'The history of the islands is marked by a slow, steady growth in population and the size of the chiefdoms, which grew to encompass whole islands.', u'Local chiefs, called ali\u02bbi, ruled their settlements, and launched wars to extend their influence and defend their communities from predatory rivals.', u'Ancient Hawaii was a caste-based society, much like that of Hindus in India.', u"=== European arrival ===\n\nIt is possible that Spanish explorers arrived in the Hawaiian Islands in the 16th century\u2014200 years before Captain James Cook's first documented visit in 1778.", u'Ruy L\xf3pez de Villalobos commanded a fleet of six ships that left Acapulco in 1542 bound for the Philippines with a Spanish sailor named Juan Gaetano aboard as pilot.', u"Depending on the interpretation, Gaetano's reports describe an encounter with either Hawai\u02bbi or the Marshall Islands.", u"If de Villalobos' crew spotted Hawai\u02bbi, Gaetano would be considered the first European to see the islands.", u'Some scholars have dismissed these claims due to a lack of credibility.', u'Spanish archives contain a chart that depicts islands at the same latitude as Hawai\u02bbi but with a longitude ten degrees east of the islands.', u'In this manuscript, the island of Maui is named La Desgraciada (The Unfortunate Island), and what appears to be Hawai\u02bbi Island is named La Mesa (The Table).', u'Islands resembling Kahoolawe, Lanai, and Molokai are named Los Monjes (The Monks).', u'For two-and-a-half centuries, Spanish galleons crossed the Pacific from Mexico along a route that passed south of Hawai\u02bbi on their way to Manila.', u'The exact route was kept secret to protect the Spanish trade monopoly against competing powers.', u'The 1778 arrival of British explorer James Cook was the first documented contact by a European explorer with Hawaii.', u'Cook named the archipelago as the Sandwich Islands in honor of his sponsor John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich.', u"Cook published the islands' location and rendered the native name as Owyhee.", u'This spelling lives on in Owyhee County, Idaho.', u'It was named after three native Hawaiian members of a trapping party who went missing in that area.', u'The Owyhee Mountains were also named for them.', u'Cook visited the Hawaiian Islands twice.', u'As he prepared for departure after his second visit in 1779, a quarrel ensued as Cook took temple idols and fencing as "firewood", and a minor chief and his men took a ship\'s boat.', u"Cook abducted the King of Hawai\u02bbi Island, Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu, and held him for ransom aboard his ship in order to gain return of Cook's boat.", u'This tactic had worked in Tahiti and other islands.', u"Instead, Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu's supporters fought back, killing Cook and four marines as Cook's party retreated along the beach to their ship.", u"They departed without the ship's boat.", u"After Cook's visit and the publication of several books relating his voyages, the Hawaiian islands attracted many European visitors: explorers, traders, and eventually whalers, who found the islands to be a convenient harbor and source of supplies.", u'Early British influence can be seen in the design of the flag of Hawai\u02bbi, which bears the Union Jack in the top-left corner.', u'These visitors introduced diseases to the once-isolated islands, causing the Hawaiian population to drop precipitously.', u'Native Hawaiians had no resistance to Eurasian diseases, such as influenza, smallpox and measles.', u'By 1820, disease, famine and wars between the chiefs killed more than half of the Native Hawaiian population.', u"During the 1850s, measles killed a fifth of Hawaii's people.", u"Historical records indicated the earliest Chinese immigrants to Hawaii originated from Guangdong Province; a few sailors arrived in 1778 with Captain Cook's journey and more arrived in 1789 with an American trader, who settled in Hawaii in the late 18th century.", u'It appears that leprosy was introduced by Chinese workers by 1830; as with the other new infectious diseases, it proved damaging to the Hawaiians.', u'=== Kingdom of Hawai\u02bbi ===\n\n\n==== House of Kamehameha ====\n\nDuring the 1780s and 1790s, chiefs often fought for power.', u'After a series of battles that ended in 1795, all inhabited islands were subjugated under a single ruler, who became known as King Kamehameha the Great.', u'He established the House of Kamehameha, a dynasty that ruled the kingdom until 1872.', u'After Kamehameha II inherited the throne in 1819, American Protestant missionaries to Hawaii converted many Hawaiians to Christianity.', u'They used their influence to end many traditional practices of the people.', u"The islands' first Christan king was Kamehameha III.", u'Hiram Bingham I, a prominent Protestant missionary, was a trusted adviser to the monarchy during this period.', u'Other missionaries and their descendants became active in commercial and political affairs, leading to conflicts between the monarchy and its restive American subjects.', u'Catholic and Mormon missionaries were also active in the kingdom, but they converted a minority of the Native Hawaiian population.', u'Missionaries from each major group administered to the leper colony at Kalaupapa on Moloka\u02bbi, which was established in 1866 and operated well into the 20th century.', u'The best known were Father Damien and Mother Marianne Cope, both of whom were canonized in the early 21st century as Roman Catholic saints.', u'The death of the bachelor King Kamehameha V\u2014who did not name an heir\u2014resulted in the popular election of Lunalilo over Kal\u0101kaua.', u'Lunalilo died the next year, also without naming an heir.', u'In 1874, the election was contested within the legislature between Kal\u0101kaua and Emma, Queen Consort of Kamehameha IV.', u'After riots broke out, the United States and Britain landed troops on the islands to restore order.', u'Governance passed to the House of Kal\u0101kaua.', u'==== 1887 Constitution and overthrow preparations ====\nIn 1887, Kal\u0101kaua was forced to sign the 1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii.', u'Drafted by white businessmen and lawyers, the document stripped the king of much of his authority.', u'It established a property qualification for voting that effectively disenfranchised most Hawaiians and immigrant laborers and favored the wealthier, white elite.', u'Resident whites were allowed to vote but resident Asians were not.', u'Because the 1887 Constitution was signed under threat of violence, it is known as the Bayonet Constitution.', u'King Kal\u0101kaua, reduced to a figurehead, reigned until his death in 1891.', u'His sister, Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani, succeeded him; she was the last monarch of Hawai\u02bbi.', u'In 1893, Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani announced plans for a new constitution.', u"On January 14, 1893, a group of mostly Euro-American business leaders and residents formed the Committee of Safety to stage a coup d'\xe9tat against the kingdom and seek annexation by the United States.", u'United States Government Minister John L. Stevens, responding to a request from the Committee of Safety, summoned a company of U.S. Marines.', u'According to historian William Russ, these troops effectively rendered the monarchy unable to protect itself.', u'=== Overthrow of 1893 \u2013 the Republic of Hawaii (1894\u20131898) ===\n\nIn January 1893, Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani was overthrown and replaced by a provisional government composed of members of the American Committee of Safety.', u'American lawyer Sanford B. Dole became President of the Republic when the Provisional Government of Hawaii ended on July 4, 1894.', u'Controversy ensued in the following years as the Queen tried to regain her throne.', u'The administration of President Grover Cleveland commissioned the Blount Report, which concluded that the removal of Lili\u02bbuokalani had been illegal.', u'The U.S. government first demanded that Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani be reinstated, but the Provisional Government refused.', u'Congress conducted an independent investigation, and on February 26, 1894, submitted the Morgan Report, which found all parties, including Minister Stevens\u2014with the exception of the Queen\u2014"not guilty" and not responsible for the coup.', u'Partisans on both sides of the debate questioned the accuracy and impartiality of both the Blount and Morgan reports over the events of 1893.', u'In 1993, the US Congress passed a joint Apology Resolution regarding the overthrow; it was signed by President Bill Clinton.', u'The resolution apologized for the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom and acknowledged that the United States had annexed Hawaii unlawfully.', u'=== Annexation \u2013 the Territory of Hawaii (1898\u20131959) ===\n\nAfter William McKinley won the 1896 U.S. presidential election, advocates pressed to annex the Republic of Hawaii.', u'The previous president, Grover Cleveland, was a friend of Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani.', u'McKinley was open to persuasion by U.S. expansionists and by annexationists from Hawai\u02bbi.', u'He met with three annexationists: Lorrin A. Thurston, Francis March Hatch and William Ansel Kinney.', u'After negotiations in June 1897, Secretary of State John Sherman agreed to a treaty of annexation with these representatives of the Republic of Hawaii.', u'The U.S. Senate never ratified the treaty.', u'Despite the opposition of most native Hawaiians, the Newlands Resolution was used to annex the Republic to the U.S.; it became the Territory of Hawaii.', u'The Newlands Resolution was passed by the House on June 15, 1898, by 209 votes in favor to 91 against, and by the Senate on July 6, 1898, by a vote of 42 to 21.', u'In 1900, Hawaii was granted self-governance and retained \u02bbIolani Palace as the territorial capitol building.', u'Despite several attempts to become a state, Hawaii remained a territory for sixty years.', u'Plantation owners and capitalists, who maintained control through financial institutions such as the Big Five, found territorial status convenient because they remained able to import cheap, foreign labor.', u'Such immigration and labor practices were prohibited in many states.', u"Puerto Rican immigration to Hawaii began in 1899 when Puerto Rico's sugar industry was devastated by two hurricanes, causing a worldwide shortage of sugar and a huge demand for sugar from Hawaii.", u'Hawaiian sugarcane plantation owners began to recruit experienced, unemployed laborers in Puerto Rico.', u'Two waves of Korean immigration to Hawaii occurred in the 20th century.', u'The first wave arrived between 1903 and 1924; the second wave began in 1965 after President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 which removed racial and national barriers and resulted in significantly altering the demographic mix in the U.S.\nO\u02bbahu was the target of a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor by Imperial Japan on December 7, 1941.', u'The attack on Pearl Harbor and other military and naval installations, carried out by aircraft and by midget submarines, brought the United States into World War II.', u'=== Political changes of 1954 \u2013 the State of Hawaii (1959\u2013present) ===\n\nIn the 1950s, the power of the plantation owners was broken by the descendants of immigrant laborers, who were born in the incorporated U.S. territory and were U.S. citizens.', u'They voted against the Hawaii Republican Party, strongly supported by plantation owners.', u'The new majority voted for the Democratic Party of Hawaii, which dominated territorial and state politics for more than 40 years.', u"Eager to gain full voting rights, Hawaii's residents actively campaigned for statehood.", u'There was concern from both political parties in the U.S. that Hawaii would be a permanent Republican Party stronghold so the admission of Alaska, thought to be a permanent Democratic Party stronghold, was to happen the same year.', u'These predictions turned out to be inaccurate; today, Hawaii votes Democratic predominately, and Alaska votes Republican.', u'In March 1959, Congress passed the Hawaii Admission Act, which U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed into law.', u'The act excluded Palmyra Atoll from statehood; it had been part of the Kingdom and Territory of Hawaii.', u'On June 27, 1959, a referendum asked residents of Hawaii to vote on the statehood bill; 94.3% voted in favor of statehood and 5.7% opposed it.', u'The referendum asked voters to choose between accepting the Act and remaining a U.S. territory.', u"The United Nations' Special Committee on Decolonization later removed Hawaii from its list of self-governing territories.", u'After attaining statehood, Hawaii quickly modernized through construction and a rapidly growing tourism economy.', u'Later, state programs promoted Hawaiian culture.', u'The Hawaii State Constitutional Convention of 1978 created institutions such as the Office of Hawaiian Affairs to promote indigenous language and culture.', u'== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\nAfter the arrival of Europeans and Americans, the population of Hawaii fell dramatically until an influx of primarily Asian settlers arrived as migrant laborers at the end of the 19th century.', u'The United States Census Bureau estimates the population of Hawaii was 1,431,603 on July 1, 2015; an increase of 5.24% since the 2010 United States Census.', u'As of 2014, Hawaii had an estimated population of 1,431,603; an increase of 12,042 from the previous year and an increase of 71,302 (5.24%) since 2010.', u'This includes a natural increase of 48,111 (96,028 births minus 47,917 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 16,956 people into the state.', u'Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 30,068; migration within the country produced a net loss of 13,112 people.', u"The center of population of Hawaii is located between the two islands of O'ahu and Moloka'i.", u'Large numbers of Native Hawaiians have moved to Las Vegas, which has been called the "ninth island" of Hawaii.', u'Hawaii has a de facto population of over 1.4 million, due in part to a large number of military personnel and tourist residents.', u"O'ahu is the most populous island; it has the highest population density with a resident population of just under one million in 597 square miles (1,546 km2), about 1,650 people per square mile.", u"Hawaii's 1.4 million residents, spread across 6,000 square miles (15,500 km2) of land, results in an average population density of 188.6 persons per square mile.", u'The state has a lower population density than Ohio and Illinois.', u'The average projected lifespan of people born in Hawaii in 2000 is 79.8 years; 77.1 years if male, 82.5 if female\u2014longer than the average lifespan of any other U.S. state.', u'As of 2011 the U.S. military reported it had 42,371 personnel on the islands.', u'=== Race and ethnicity ===\n\nAccording to the 2010 United States Census, Hawaii had a population of 1,360,301.', u"The state's population identified as 38.6% Asian; 24.7% White (22.7% Non-Hispanic White Alone); 23.6% from two or more races; 10.0% Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders; 8.9% Hispanics and Latinos of any race; 1.6% Black or African American; 1.2% from some other race; and 0.3% Native American and Alaska Native.", u'Hawaii has the highest percentage of Asian Americans and multiracial Americans and the lowest percentage of White Americans of any state.', u'It is the only state where Asian Americans identify as the largest ethnic group.', u'In 2011, 14.5% of births were to white, non-Hispanic parents.', u"Hawaii's Asian population consists mainly of 198,000 (14.6%) Filipino Americans, 185,000 (13.6%) Japanese Americans, roughly 55,000 (4.0%) Chinese Americans, and 24,000 (1.8%) Korean Americans.", u'There are over 80,000 Indigenous Hawaiians\u20145.9% of the population.', u"Including those with partial ancestry, Samoan Americans constitute 2.8% of Hawaii's population, and Tongan Americans constitute 0.6%.", u'Over 120,000 (8.8%) of Hispanic and Latino Americans live in Hawaii.', u'Mexican Americans number over 35,000 (2.6%); Puerto Ricans exceed 44,000 (3.2%).', u"Multiracial Americans constitute almost 25% of Hawaii's population, exceeding 320,000 people.", u'Eurasian Americans are a prominent mixed-race group, numbering about 66,000 (4.9%).', u'The Non-Hispanic White population numbers around 310,000\u2014just over 20% of the population.', u'The multi-racial population outnumbers the non-Hispanic white population by about 10,000 people.', u"In 1970, the Census Bureau reported Hawaii's population was 38.8% white and 57.7% Asian and Pacific Islander.", u'The five largest European ancestries in Hawaii are German (7.4%), Irish (5.2%), English (4.6%), Portuguese (4.3%) and Italian (2.7%).', u"About 82.2% of the state's residents were born in the United States.", u'Roughly 75% of foreign-born residents originate in Asia.', u'Hawaii is a majority-minority state.', u'It is expected to be one of three states that will not have a non-Hispanic white plurality in 2014; the other two are California and New Mexico.', u'=== Ancestry groups ===\n\nThe third group of foreigners to arrive in Hawaii were from China.', u'Chinese workers on Western trading ships settled in Hawaii starting in 1789.', u'In 1820, the first American missionaries arrived to preach Christianity and teach the Hawaiians Western ways.', u"As of 2015, a large proportion of Hawaii's population have Asian ancestry\u2014especially Filipino, Japanese and Chinese.", u'Many are descendants of immigrants brought to work on the sugarcane plantations in the mid-to-late 19th century.', u'The first 153 Japanese immigrants arrived in Hawaii on June 19, 1868.', u'They were not approved by the then-current Japanese government because the contract was between a broker and the Tokugawa shogunate\u2014by then replaced by the Meiji Restoration.', u"The first Japanese current-government-approved immigrants arrived on February 9, 1885, after Kal\u0101kaua's petition to Emperor Meiji when Kal\u0101kaua visited Japan in 1881.", u'Almost 13,000 Portuguese migrants had arrived by 1899; they also worked on the sugarcane plantations.', u'By 1901, over 5,000 Puerto Ricans were living in Hawaii.', u'=== Languages ===\nEnglish (General American) and Hawaiian are listed as Hawaii\'s "official languages" in the state\'s 1978 constitution.', u'Article XV, Section 4 specifies that "Hawaiian shall be required for public acts and transactions only as provided by law".', u'Hawai\u02bbi Creole English, locally referred to as "Pidgin", is the native language of many native residents and is a second language for many others.', u'As of the 2000 Census, 73.44% of Hawaii residents aged five and older exclusively speak English at home.', u"According to the 2008 American Community Survey, 74.6% of Hawaii's residents over the age of five speak only English at home.", u'In their homes, 21.0% of state residents speak an additional Asian language, 2.6% speak Spanish, 1.6% speak other Indo-European languages and 0.2% speak another language.', u'After English, other languages popularly spoken in the state are Tagalog, Japanese and Ilokano.', u'Significant numbers of European immigrants and their descendants also speak their native languages; the most numerous are German, Portuguese, Italian and French.', u'5.37% of residents speak Tagalog\u2014which includes non-native speakers of Filipino language, the national, co-official, Tagalog-based language; 4.96% speak Japanese and 4.05% speak Ilokano; 1.2% speak Chinese, 1.68% speak Hawaiian; 1.66% speak Spanish; 1.61% speak Korean; and 1.01% speak Samoan.', u"Finally, Hawai'i Sign Language is spoken on the islands, but is dwindling in numbers due to American Sign Language supplanting HSL through schooling and various other domains.", u'The keyboard layout used for Hawaiian is QWERTY.', u'==== Hawaiian ====\n\nThe Hawaiian language has about 2,000 native speakers, less than 0.1% of the total population.', u'According to the United States Census, there were over 24,000 total speakers of the language in Hawaii in 2006\u20132008.', u'Hawaiian is a Polynesian member of the Austronesian language family.', u'It is closely related to other Polynesian languages, such as Marquesan, Tahitian, M\u0101ori, Rapa Nui (the language of Easter Island), and less closely to Samoan and Tongan.', u'According to Sch\xfctz, the Marquesans colonized the archipelago in roughly 300 CE and were later followed by waves of seafarers from the Society Islands, Samoa and Tonga.', u'These Polynesians remained in the islands; they eventually became the Hawaiian people and their languages evolved into the Hawaiian language.', u'Kimura and Wilson say, "[l]inguists agree that Hawaiian is closely related to Eastern Polynesian, with a particularly strong link in the Southern Marquesas, and a secondary link in Tahiti, which may be explained by voyaging between the Hawaiian and Society Islands".', u'Before the arrival of Captain James Cook, the Hawaiian language had no written form.', u'That form was developed mainly by American Protestant |missionaries between 1820 and 1826.', u'They assigned to the Hawaiian phonemes letters from the Latin alphabet.', u'Interest in Hawaiian increased significantly in the late 20th century.', u'With the help of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, specially designated immersion schools in which all subjects would be taught in Hawaiian were established.', u'The University of Hawaii developed a Hawaiian language graduate studies program.', u'Municipal codes were altered to favor Hawaiian place and street names for new civic developments.', u'A sign language for the deaf, based on the Hawaiian language, has been in use in the islands since the early 1800s.', u'Hawai\u02bbi Sign Language is now nearly extinct.', u'Hawaiian distinguishes between long and short vowel sounds.', u'In modern practice, vowel length is indicated with a macron (kahak\u014d).', u'Hawaiian-language newspapers (n\u016bpepa) published from 1834 to 1948 and traditional native speakers of Hawaiian generally omit the marks in their own writing.', u'The \u02bbokina and kahak\u014d are intended to help non-native speakers.', u'The Hawaiian language uses the glottal stop (\u02bbokina) as a consonant.', u'It is written as a symbol similar to the apostrophe or left-hanging (opening) single quotation mark.', u'==== Hawaiian Pidgin ====\n\nSome residents of Hawaii speak Hawai\u02bbi Creole English (HCE), endonymically called pidgin or pidgin English.', u'The lexicon of HCE derives mainly from English but also uses words that have derived from Hawaiian, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Ilocano and Tagalog.', u'During the 19th century, the increase in immigration\u2014mainly from China, Japan, Portugal\u2014especially from the Azores and Madeira, and Spain\u2014catalyzed the development of a hybrid variant of English known to its speakers as pidgin.', u'By the early 20th century, pidgin speakers had children who acquired it as their first language.', u'HCE speakers use some Hawaiian words without those words being considered archaic.', u'Most place names are retained from Hawaiian, as are some names for plants and animals.', u'For example, tuna fish is often called by its Hawaiian name, ahi.', u'HCE speakers have modified the meanings of some English words.', u'For example, "aunty" and "uncle" may either refer to any adult who is a friend or be used to show respect to an elder.', u'Syntax and grammar follow distinctive rules different from those of General American English.', u'For example, instead of "it is hot today, isn\'t it?', u'", an HCE speaker would say simply "stay hot, eh?"', u'The term da kine is used as a filler; a substitute for virtually any word or phrase.', u'During the surfing boom in Hawaii, HCE was influenced by surfer slang.', u'Some HCE expressions, such as brah and da kine, have found their ways elsewhere through surfing communities.', u'=== Religion ===\n\nChristianity is the most widespread religion in Hawaii.', u'It is mainly represented by various Protestants, Catholics and Mormons.', u"Buddhism is the second most popular religion, especially among the archipelago's Japanese community.", u'Unaffilliated account for one-quarter of the population.', u'The largest denominations by number of adherents were the Catholic Church with 249,619 adherents in 2010 and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with 68,128 adherents in 2009.', u'The third-largest religious group includes all non-denominational churches, with 128 congregations and 32,000 members.', u'The third-largest denominational group is the United Church of Christ, with 115 congregations and 20,000 members.', u'The Southern Baptist Convention has 108 congregations and 18,000 members in Hawaii.', u'According to data provided by religious establishments, religion in Hawaii in 2000 was distributed as follows:\n\nA Pew poll found that the religious composition was as follows:\n\n\n=== LGBT ===\nHawaii has had a long history of queer identities.', u'M\u0101h\u016b people, who often traversed gender as defined by Western standards, were a respected group of pre-colonization people who were widely known in society as healers.', u'Another Hawaiian word, aik\u0101ne, referred to same-sex relationships.', u"According to journals written by Captain Cook's crew, it is widely believed that many ali\u02bbi engaged in aik\u0101ne relationships.", u'Hawaiian scholar Lilikal\u0101 Kame\u02bbeleihiwa said, "If you didn\'t sleep with a man, how could you trust him when you went into battle?', u'How would you know if he was going to be the warrior that would protect you at all costs, if he wasn\'t your lover?"', u'A 2012 poll by Gallup found that Hawaii had the largest proportion of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) adults in the U.S., at 5.1%, comprising an estimated adult LGBT population of 53,966 individuals.', u'The number of same-sex couple households in 2010 was 3,239; a 35.45% increase of figures from a decade earlier.', u'In 2013, Hawaii became the fifteenth U.S. state to legalize same-sex marriage; a University of Hawaii researcher said the law may boost tourism by $217 million.', u"== Economy ==\n\nThe history of Hawaii's economy can be traced through a succession of dominant industries; sandalwood, whaling, sugarcane, pineapple, the military, tourism and education.", u'Since statehood in 1959, tourism has been the largest industry, contributing 24.3% of the gross state product (GSP) in 1997, despite efforts to diversify.', u"The state's gross output for 2003 was US$47 billion; per capita income for Hawaii residents in 2014 was US$54,516.", u'Hawaiian exports include food and clothing.', u'These industries play a small role in the Hawaiian economy, due to the shipping distance to viable markets, such as the West Coast of the contiguous U.S.', u"The state's food exports include coffee, macadamia nuts, pineapple, livestock, sugarcane and honey.", u"By weight, honey bees may be the state's most valuable export.", u'According to the Hawaii Agricultural Statistics Service, agricultural sales were US$370.9 million from diversified agriculture, US$100.6 million from pineapple, and US$64.3 million from sugarcane.', u"Hawaii's relatively consistent climate has attracted the seed industry, which is able to test three generations of crops per year on the islands, compared with one or two on the mainland.", u'Seeds yielded US$264 million in 2012, supporting 1,400 workers.', u"As of December 2015, the state's unemployment rate was 3.2%.", u'In 2009, the United States military spent US$12.2 billion in Hawaii, accounting for 18% of spending in the state for that year.', u'75,000 United States Department of Defense personnel live in Hawaii.', u'According to a 2013 study by Phoenix Marketing International, Hawaii had the fourth-largest number of millionaires per capita in the United States, with a ratio of 7.18%.', u'=== Taxation ===\nHawaii residents pay the most per person in state taxes in the United States.', u'Millions of tourists pay general excise tax and hotel room tax.', u"The Hawaii Tax Foundation considers the state's tax burden too high, which it says contributes to higher prices and the perception of an unfriendly business climate.", u'State Senator Sam Slom says state taxes are comparatively higher than other states because the state government handles education, health care, and social services that are usually handled at a county or municipal level in most other states.', u'=== Cost of living ===\nThe cost of living in Hawaii, specifically Honolulu, is high compared to that of most major U.S. cities.', u'However, the cost of living in Honolulu is 6.7% lower than in New York City and 3.6% lower than in San Francisco.', u'These numbers may not take some costs, such as increased travel costs for flights, additional shipping fees, and the loss of promotional participation opportunities for customers outside the continental U.S., into account.', u'While some online stores offer free shipping on orders to Hawaii, many merchants exclude Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico and certain other U.S. territories.', u"Hawaiian Electric Industries, a privately owned company, provides 95% of the state's population with electricity, mostly from fossil-fuel power stations.", u'Average electricity prices in October 2014 (36.41 cents per kilowatt-hour) were nearly three times the national average (12.58 cents per kilowatt-hour) and 80% higher than the second-highest state, Connecticut.', u'The median home value in Hawaii in the 2000 U.S. Census was US$272,700, while the national median home value was US$119,600.', u'Hawaii home values were the highest of all states, including California with a median home value of US$211,500.', u'Research from the National Association of Realtors places the 2010 median sale price of a single family home in Honolulu, Hawaii, at US$607,600 and the U.S. median sales price at US$173,200.', u'The sale price of single family homes in Hawaii was the highest of any U.S. city in 2010, just above that of the Silicon Valley area of California (US$602,000).', u"Hawaii's very high cost of living is the result of several interwoven factors of the global economy in addition to domestic U.S. government trade policy.", u'Like other regions with desirable weather throughout the year, such as areas of California, Arizona and Florida, Hawaii\'s residents can be considered to be subject to a "Sunshine tax".', u'This situation is further exacerbated by the natural factors of geography and world distribution that lead to higher prices for goods due to increased shipping costs, a problem which many island states and territories suffer from as well.', u'The situation is compounded even further by what could possibly be the single largest contributor to the high costs of living in Hawaii, a U.S. trade law known as the Jones Act, or the Merchant Marine Act of 1920.', u'This trade regulation prohibits any foreign-flagged ships from carrying cargo between two American ports\u2014a practice known as cabotage.', u'Most consumer goods in the United States are manufactured by outsourced labor in East Asia, then transported by container ships to ports on the U.S. mainland, and Hawaii also receives the same goods.', u'Being located in the central Pacific Ocean, right between major Pacific shipping lanes, it would be very economical to unload Hawaiian-bound goods in Honolulu, before continuing on to the mainland.', u'However, this would effectively make the second leg of the voyage between Hawaii and the mainland a domestic route between two American ports.', u'Because most large cargo ships operate under foreign "flags of convenience" such as Liberia, Vanuatu or Papua New Guinea, allowing them to avoid the more stringent, and thus more costly, regulations of developed nations\' ports, the domestic leg of the voyage would be disallowed by the Jones Act.', u'Instead, those cargo ships must proceed directly to the West Coast, where distributors break bulk and transport the Hawaiian-bound, Asian-manufactured goods back across the ocean by U.S.-flagged ships and increasing the length of the voyage by more than 50%.', u"This highly-inefficient system of shipping Hawaii's consumer cargo comes at a very hefty price for the average Hawaiian citizen, and makes the cost of living in Hawaii much, much higher than it would otherwise be.", u'Hawaiian consumers ultimately bear the expense of transporting goods imposed by the Jones Act.', u'This law makes Hawaii less competitive than West Coast ports as a shopping destination for tourists from countries with much higher taxes like Japan, even though prices for Asian-manufactured goods should be cheaper because Hawaii is much closer than mainland states to Asia.', u'== Culture ==\n\nThe aboriginal culture of Hawaii is Polynesian.', u'Hawaii represents the northernmost extension of the vast Polynesian Triangle of the south and central Pacific Ocean.', u'While traditional Hawaiian culture remains as vestiges in modern Hawaiian society, there are re-enactments of the ceremonies and traditions throughout the islands.', u'Some of these cultural influences, including the popularity (in greatly modified form) of l\u016b\u02bbau and hula, are strong enough to affect the wider United States.', u'=== Cuisine ===\n\nThe cuisine of Hawaii is a fusion of many foods brought by immigrants to the Hawaiian Islands, including the earliest Polynesians and Native Hawaiian cuisine, and American, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Polynesian and Portuguese origins.', u'Plant and animal food sources are imported from around the world for agricultural use in Hawaii.', u'Poi, a starch made by pounding taro, is one of the traditional foods of the islands.', u'Many local restaurants serve the ubiquitous plate lunch, which features two scoops of rice, a simplified version of American macaroni salad and a variety of toppings including hamburger patties, a fried egg, and gravy of a loco moco, Japanese style tonkatsu or the traditional l\u016b\u02bbau favorites, including k\u0101lua pork and laulau.', u'Spam musubi is an example of the fusion of ethnic cuisine that developed on the islands among the mix of immigrant groups and military personnel.', u'In the 1990s, a group of chefs developed Hawaii regional cuisine as a contemporary fusion cuisine.', u"=== Customs and etiquette ===\n\nSome key customs and etiquette in Hawaii are as follows: when visiting a home, it is considered good manners to bring a small gift for one's host (for example, a dessert).", u'Thus, parties are usually in the form of potlucks.', u'Most locals take their shoes off before entering a home.', u"It is customary for Hawaiian families, regardless of ethnicity, to hold a luau to celebrate a child's first birthday.", u'It is also customary at Hawaiian weddings, especially at Filipino weddings, for the bride and groom to do a money dance (also called the pandanggo).', u'Print media and local residents recommend that one refer to non-Hawaiians as "locals of Hawaii" or "people of Hawaii".', u'=== Hawaiian mythology ===\n\nHawaiian mythology comprises the legends, historical tales, and sayings of the ancient Hawaiian people.', u'It is considered a variant of a more general Polynesian mythology that developed a unique character for several centuries before about 1800.', u'It is associated with the Hawaiian religion, which was officially suppressed in the 19th century but was kept alive by some practitioners to the modern day.', u'Prominent figures and terms include Aumakua, the spirit of an ancestor or family god and K\u0101ne, the highest of the four major Hawaiian deities.', u'=== Polynesian mythology ===\n\nPolynesian mythology is the oral traditions of the people of Polynesia, a grouping of Central and South Pacific Ocean island archipelagos in the Polynesian triangle together with the scattered cultures known as the Polynesian outliers.', u'Polynesians speak languages that descend from a language reconstructed as Proto-Polynesian that was probably spoken in the area around Tonga and Samoa in around 1000 BCE.', u'Prior to the 15th century, Polynesian people migrated east to the Cook Islands, and from there to other island groups such as Tahiti and the Marquesas.', u'Their descendants later discovered the islands Tahiti, Rapa Nui and later the Hawaiian Islands and New Zealand.', u'The Polynesian languages are part of the Austronesian language family.', u'Many are close enough in terms of vocabulary and grammar to be mutually intelligible.', u'There are also substantial cultural similarities between the various groups, especially in terms of social organization, childrearing, horticulture, building and textile technologies.', u'Their mythologies in particular demonstrate local reworkings of commonly shared tales.', u'The Polynesian cultures each have distinct but related oral traditions; legends or myths are traditionally considered to recount ancient history (the time of "p\u014d") and the adventures of gods ("atua") and deified ancestors.', u'=== List of state parks ===\n\nThere are many Hawaiian state parks.', u'The Island of Hawai\u02bbi has state parks, recreation areas, and historical parks.', u'Kaua\u02bbi has the Ahukini State Recreation Pier, six state parks, and the Russian Fort Elizabeth State Historical Park.', u'Maui has two state monuments, several state parks, and the Polipoli Spring State Recreation Area.', u"Moloka\u2018i has the Pala'au State Park.", u'O\u02bbahu has several state parks, a number of state recreation areas, and a number of monuments, including the Ulu P\u014d Heiau State Monument.', u'=== Literature ===\n\nThe literature of Hawaii is diverse and includes authors Kiana Davenport, Lois-Ann Yamanaka, and Kaui Hart Hemmings.', u'Hawaiian magazines include Hana Hou!, Hawaii Business Magazine and Honolulu, among others.', u'=== Music ===\n\nThe music of Hawaii includes traditional and popular styles, ranging from native Hawaiian folk music to modern rock and hip hop.', u"Hawaii's musical contributions to the music of the United States are out of proportion to the state's small size.", u'Styles such as slack-key guitar are well-known worldwide, while Hawaiian-tinged music is a frequent part of Hollywood soundtracks.', u'Hawaii also made a major contribution to country music with the introduction of the steel guitar.', u"Traditional Hawaiian folk music is a major part of the state's musical heritage.", u'The Hawaiian people have inhabited the islands for centuries and have retained much of their traditional musical knowledge.', u'Their music is largely religious in nature, and includes chanting and dance music.', u'Hawaiian music has had an enormous impact on the music of other Polynesian islands; according to Peter Manuel, the influence of Hawaiian music a "unifying factor in the development of modern Pacific musics".', u'== Tourism ==\n\nTourism is an important part of the Hawaiian economy.', u'In 2003, according to state government data, there were over 6.4 million visitors, with expenditures of over $10 billion, to the Hawaiian Islands.', u'Due to the mild year-round weather, tourist travel is popular throughout the year.', u'The major holidays are the most popular times for outsiders to visit, especially in the winter months.', u'Substantial numbers of Japanese tourists still visit the islands but have now been surpassed by Chinese and Koreans due to the collapse of the value of the Yen and the weak Japanese economy.', u'The average Japanese stays only 5 days while other Asians spend over 9.5 days and spend 25% more.', u'Hawaii hosts numerous cultural events.', u'The annual Merrie Monarch Festival is an international Hula competition.', u'The Hawaii International Film Festival is the premier film festival for Pacific rim cinema.', u"Honolulu hosts the state's long-running LGBT film festival, the Rainbow Film Festival.", u"== Health ==\n\nAs of 2009, Hawaii's health care system insures 92% of residents.", u"Under the state's plan, businesses are required to provide insurance to employees who work more than twenty hours per week.", u'Heavy regulation of insurance companies helps reduce the cost to employers.', u'Due in part to heavy emphasis on preventive care, Hawaiians require hospital treatment less frequently than the rest of the United States, while total health care expenses measured as a percentage of state GDP are substantially lower.', u'Proponents of universal health care elsewhere in the U.S. sometimes use Hawaii as a model for proposed federal and state health care plans.', u'== Education ==\n\n\n=== Public schools ===\n\nHawaii has the only school system within the U.S. that is unified statewide.', u'Policy decisions are made by the fourteen-member state Board of Education, which sets policy and hires the superintendent of schools, who oversees the state Department of Education.', u'The Department of Education is divided into seven districts; four on O\u02bbahu and one for each of the other three counties.', u'The main rationale for centralization is to combat inequalities between highly populated O\u02bbahu and the more rural Neighbor Islands, and between lower-income and more affluent areas.', u'In most of the U.S., schools are funded from local property taxes.', u'Educators struggle with children of non-native-English-speaking immigrants, whose cultures are different from those of the mainland, where most course materials and testing standards originate.', u'Public elementary, middle and high school test scores in Hawaii are below national averages on tests mandated under the No Child Left Behind Act.', u'The Hawaii Board of Education requires all eligible students to take these tests and report all student test scores; some other states\u2014Texas and Michigan, for example\u2014do not.', u'This may have unbalanced the results that reported in August 2005 that of 282 schools across the state, 185 failed to reach federal minimum performance standards in mathematics and reading.', u"The ACT college placement tests show that in 2005, seniors scored slightly above the national average (21.9 compared with 20.9), but in the widely accepted SAT examinations, Hawaii's college-bound seniors tend to score below the national average in all categories except mathematics.", u'=== Private schools ===\nHawaii has the highest rates of private school attendance in the nation.', u'During the 2011-2012 school year, Hawaii public and charter schools had an enrollment of 181,213, while private schools had 37,695.', u'Private schools educated over 17% of students in Hawaii that school year, nearly three times the approximate national average of 6%.', u'It has four of the largest independent schools; \u02bbIolani School, Kamehameha Schools, Mid-Pacific Institute and Punahou School.', u'Pacific Buddhist Academy, the second Buddhist high school in the U.S. and first such school in Hawaii, was founded in 2003.', u'The first native controlled public charter school was the Kanu O Ka Aina New Century Charter School.', u'Independent and charter schools can select their students, while the public schools are open to all students in their district.', u'The Kamehameha Schools are the only schools in the U.S. that openly grant admission to students based on ancestry; collectively, they are one of the wealthiest schools in the United States, if not the world, having over eleven billion US dollars in estate assets.', u'In 2005, Kamehameha enrolled 5,398 students, 8.4% of the Native Hawaiian children in the state.', u'=== Colleges and universities ===\n\nGraduates of secondary schools in Hawaii often enter directly into the workforce.', u'Some attend colleges and universities on the mainland or other countries, and the rest attend an institution of higher learning in Hawaii.', u'The largest is the University of Hawaii System, which consists of: the research university at M\u0101noa, two comprehensive campuses at Hilo and West O\u02bbahu, and seven community colleges.', u'Private universities include Brigham Young University\u2013Hawaii, Chaminade University of Honolulu, Hawaii Pacific University, and Wayland Baptist University.', u'Saint Stephen Diocesan Center is a seminary of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu.', u'Kona hosts the University of the Nations, which is not an accredited university.', u'=== P\u016bnana Leo ===\n\nFirst opened in 1984 illegally in Kekaha, Kaua\'i, the P\u016bnana Leo or "Language Nest" (lit.', u'"Nest of Voices") were the first indigenous language immersion schools in the United States.', u'Modelled after the M\u0101ori language K\u014dhanga reo of New Zealand, they provide preschool aged children the opportunity to engage in early education through a Hawaiian

and more than two-thirds of the Korean Peninsula under Gwanggaeto the Great.', u'Since their unification into Later Silla and Balhae in the 7th century, Korea enjoyed over a millennium of relative tranquility under long lasting dynasties, with innovations like Hangul, the unique alphabet created by Sejong the Great in 1446, enabling anyone to easily learn to read and write.', u'Its rich and vibrant culture left 17 UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity, the third largest in the world, along with 12 World Heritage Sites.', u'Annexed by Imperial Japan in 1910 due to its strategic and central location, Korea was divided into North and South after its surrender in 1945.', u'A North Korean invasion led to the Korean War (1950\u201353).', u"Peace has since mostly continued with the two agreeing to work peacefully for reunification and the South solidifying peace as a regional power with the world's 10th largest defence budget.", u"South Korea's tiger economy soared at an annual average of 10% for over 30 years in a period of rapid transformation called the Miracle on the Han River.", u'A long legacy of openness and focus in innovation made it successful.', u"Today, it

transition to high-speed Internet and start the world's first mobile TV broadcast with 97% of cellphones already having Internet access.", u'== Etymology ==\n\nThe name Korea derives from Goryeo (also spelled as Kory\u014f), the successor state of Goguryeo (Kogury\u014f), and the first Korean dynasty visited by Persian merchants, who called it "Korea".', u'The name Goryeo (a shortened form of Goguryeo) originally referred to the ancient kingdom of Goguryeo, which referred to itself, and was widely referred to, as "Goryeo" since the 5th century.', u'The modern spelling, "Korea", first appeared in the late 17th century in the travel writings of the Dutch East India Company\'s Hendrick Hamel.', u'Despite the coexistence of the spellings Corea and Korea in 19th century publications, some Koreans believe that Imperial Japan, around the time of the Japanese occupation, intentionally standardised the spelling on Korea, making Japan appear first alphabetically.', u'After Goryeo was replaced by Joseon in 1392, Joseon became the official name for the entire territory, though it was not universally accepted.', u'The new official name has its origin in the ancient country of Gojoseon (Old Joseon).', u'In 1897, the Joseon dynasty changed the official name of the country from Joseon to Daehan Jeguk (Korean Empire).', u'The name Daehan, which means "great Han" literally, derives from Samhan (Three Hans).', u'However, the name Joseon was still widely used by Koreans to refer to their country, though it was no longer the official name.', u'Under Japanese rule, the two names Han and Joseon coexisted.', u'There were several groups who fought for independence, the most notable being the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea (\ub300\ud55c\ubbfc\uad6d \uc784\uc2dc\uc815\ubd80/\u5927\u97d3\u6c11\u570b\u81e8\u6642\u653f\u5e9c).', u'Following the surrender of Japan, in 1945, the Republic of Korea (\ub300\ud55c\ubbfc\uad6d/\u5927\u97d3\u6c11\u570b) was adopted as the legal name for the new country.', u'Since the government only controlled the southern part of the Korean Peninsula, the informal term South Korea was coined, becoming increasingly common in the western world.', u'While South Koreans use Han (or Hanguk) to refer to the entire country, North Koreans and Koreans in China use the term Joseon as the name of the country.', u'== History ==\n\n\n=== Gojoseon ===\n\nThe history of Korea begins with the founding of Joseon (often known as "Gojoseon" to prevent confusion with another dynasty founded in the 14th century; the prefix Go- means \'older,\' \'before,\' or \'earlier\') in 2333 BC by Dangun, according to Korean foundation mythology.', u'Gojoseon expanded until it controlled northern Korean Peninsula and some parts of Manchuria.', u'Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in the 12th century BC, and its existence and role have been controversial in the modern era.', u'In the 2nd century BC, Wiman Joseon fell to Han China near the end of the century.', u'Later the Han Dynasty set up Four Commanderies of Han in 108 BC.', u'There was a significant Chinese presence in northern parts of the Korean peninsula during the next century, and the Lelang Commandery persisted for about 400 years until it was conquered by Goguryeo.', u'After many conflicts with the Chinese Han Dynasty, Gojoseon disintegrated, leading to the Proto\u2013Three Kingdoms of Korea period.', u'=== Three Kingdoms of Korea ===\nIn the early centuries AD, Buyeo, Okjeo, Dongye, and the Samhan confederacy occupied the peninsula and southern Manchuria.', u'Of the various states, Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla grew to control the peninsula as the Three Kingdoms of Korea.', u'Goguryeo, the largest and most powerful among them, was a highly militaristic state, and competed with various Chinese dynasties during its 700 years of history.', u'Goguryeo experienced a golden age under Gwanggaeto the Great and his son Jangsu, who both subdued Baekje and Silla during their times, achieving a brief unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea and becoming the most dominant power on the Korean Peninsula.', u'In addition to contesting for control of the Korean Peninsula, Goguryeo had many military conflicts with various Chinese dynasties, most notably the Goguryeo\u2013Sui War, in which Goguryeo defeated a huge force said to number over a million men.', u'Baekje was a great maritime power; its nautical skill, which made it the Phoenicia of East Asia, was instrumental in the dissemination of Buddhism throughout East Asia and continental culture to Japan.', u'Baekje was once a great military power on the Korean Peninsula, especially during the time of Geunchogo, but was critically defeated by Gwanggaeto the Great and declined.', u'Silla was the smallest and weakest of the three, but it used cunning diplomatic means to make opportunistic pacts and alliances with the more powerful Korean kingdoms, and eventually Tang China, to its great advantage.', u'=== North\u2013South Kingdoms ===\nThe unification of the Three Kingdoms by Silla in 676 led to the North South States Period, in which much of the Korean Peninsula was controlled by Later Silla, while Balhae controlled the northern parts of Goguryeo.', u'Balhae was founded by a Goguryeo general and formed as a successor state to Goguryeo.', u'During its height, Balhae controlled most of Manchuria and parts of the Russian Far East.', u'Later Silla was a golden age of art and culture, as evidenced by the Hwangnyongsa, Seokguram, and Emille Bell.', u'Relationships between Korea and China remained relatively peaceful during this time.', u'Later Silla carried on the maritime prowess of Baekje, which acted like the Phoenicia of medieval East Asia, and during the 8th and 9th centuries dominated the seas of East Asia and the trade between China, Korea and Japan, most notably during the time of Jang Bogo; in addition, Silla people made overseas communities in China on the Shandong Peninsula and the mouth of the Yangtze River.', u'Later Silla was a prosperous and wealthy country, and its metropolitan capital of Gyeongju was the fourth largest city in the world.', u'Buddhism flourished during this time, and many Korean Buddhists gained great fame among Chinese Buddhists and contributed to Chinese Buddhism, including: Woncheuk, Wonhyo, Uisang, Musang, and Kim Gyo-gak, a Silla prince whose influence made Mount Jiuhua one of the Four Sacred Mountains of Chinese Buddhism.', u'However, Later Silla weakened under internal strife and the revival of Baekje and Goguryeo, which led to the Later Three Kingdoms period in the late 9th century.', u'=== Goryeo ===\nIn 936, the Later Three Kingdoms were united by Wang Geon, a descendant of Goguryeo nobility, who established Goryeo as the successor state of Goguryeo.', u'Balhae had fallen to the Khitan Empire in 926, and a decade later the last crown prince of Balhae fled south to Goryeo, where he was warmly welcomed and included into the ruling family by Wang Geon, thus unifying the two successor nations of Goguryeo.', u"Like Silla, Goryeo was a highly cultural state and created the Jikji in 1377, using the world's oldest metal movable type printing press.", u'After defeating the Khitan Empire, which was the most powerful empire of its time, in the Goryeo\u2013Khitan War, Goryeo experienced a golden age that lasted a century, during which the Tripitaka Koreana was completed and there were great developments in printing and publishing, promoting learning and dispersing knowledge on philosophy, literature, religion, and science; by 1100, there were 12 universities that produced famous scholars and scientists.', u'However, the Mongol invasions in the 13th century greatly weakened the kingdom.', u'Goryeo was never conquered by the Mongols, but exhausted after three decades of fighting, the Korean court sent its crown prince to the Yuan capital to swear allegiance to Kublai Khan, who accepted, and married one of his daughters to the Korean crown prince.', u'Henceforth, Goryeo continued to rule Korea, though as a tributary ally to the Mongols for the next 86 years.', u'During this period, the two nations became intertwined as all subsequent Korean kings married Mongol princesses, and the last empress of the Yuan dynasty was a Korean princess.', u'After the Mongolian Empire collapsed, severe political strife followed and the Goryeo Dynasty was replaced by the Joseon Dynasty in 1392, following a rebellion by General Yi Seong-gye.', u'=== Joseon ===\nKing Taejo declared the new name of Korea as "Joseon" in reference to Gojoseon, and moved the capital to Hanseong (one of the old names of Seoul).', u'The first 200 years of the Joseon dynasty were marked by peace, and saw great advancements in science and education, as well as the creation of Hangul by Sejong the Great to promote literacy among the common people.', u'The prevailing ideology of the time was Neo-Confucianism, which was epitomized by the seonbi class: nobles who passed up positions of wealth and power to lead lives of study and integrity.', u'Between 1592 and 1598, Japan invaded Korea.', u'Toyotomi Hideyoshi led the Japanese forces, but his advance was halted by Korean forces (most notably the Joseon Navy led by Admiral Yi Sun-sin and his renowned "turtle ship") with assistance from Righteous Army militias formed by Korean civilians, and Ming Dynasty Chinese troops.', u'Through a series of successful battles of attrition, the Japanese forces were eventually forced to withdraw, and relations between all parties became normalized.', u'In 1627 and 1637, Joseon suffered two separate invasions by the Manchu, which also extended to China and led to the conquest of the Ming Dynasty.', u'After the second Manchu invasion in 1637, Joseon experienced a nearly 200-year period of peace.', u'Kings Yeongjo and Jeongjo particularly led a new renaissance of the Joseon Dynasty during the 18th century.', u'However, the latter years of the Joseon Dynasty were marked by isolation from the outside world.', u'During the 19th century, Korea\'s isolationist policy earned it the name the "Hermit Kingdom".', u'The Joseon Dynasty tried to protect itself against Western imperialism, but was eventually forced to open trade.', u'After the First Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War, Korea was occupied by Japan (1910\u201345).', u'At the end of World War II, the Japanese surrendered to Soviet and U.S. forces who occupied the northern and southern halves of Korea, respectively.', u'=== South Korea ===\n\nDespite the initial plan of a unified Korea in the 1943 Cairo Declaration, escalating Cold War antagonism between the Soviet Union and the United States eventually led to the establishment of separate governments, each with its own ideology, leading to the division of Korea into two political entities in 1948: North Korea and South Korea.', u'In the South, Syngman Rhee, an opponent of communism, who had been backed and appointed by the United States as head of the provisional government, won the first presidential elections of the newly declared Republic of Korea in May.', u"In the North, a former anti-Japanese guerrilla and communist activist, Kim Il-sung was appointed premier of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in September.", u"In October the Soviet Union declared Kim Il-sung's government as sovereign over both parts.", u'The UN declared Rhee\'s government as "a lawful government having effective control and jurisdiction over that part of Korea where the UN Temporary Commission on Korea was able to observe and consult" and the Government "based on elections which was observed by the Temporary Commission" in addition to a statement that "this is the only such government in Korea."', u'Both leaders began an authoritarian repression of their political opponents inside their region, seeking for a unification of Korea under their control.', u"While South Korea's request for military support was denied by the United States, North Korea's military was heavily reinforced by the Soviet Union.", u"On June 25, 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea, sparking the Korean War, the Cold War's first major conflict, which continued until 1953.", u'At the time, the Soviet Union had boycotted the United Nations (UN), thus forfeiting their veto rights.', u'This allowed the UN to intervene in a civil war when it became apparent that the superior North Korean forces would unify the entire country.', u'The Soviet Union and China backed North Korea, with the later participation of millions of Chinese troops.', u'After an ebb and flow that saw both sides almost pushed to the brink of extinction, and massive losses among Korean civilians in both the north and the south, the war eventually reached a stalemate.', u'The 1953 armistice, never signed by South Korea, split the peninsula along the demilitarized zone near the original demarcation line.', u'No peace treaty was ever signed, resulting in the two countries remaining technically at war.', u'Over 1.2 million people died during the Korean War.', u'In 1960, a student uprising (the "April 19 Revolution") led to the resignation of the autocratic, corrupt President Syngman Rhee.', u"A period of political instability followed, broken by General Park Chung-hee's May 16 coup against the weak and ineffectual government the next year.", u'Park took over as president until his assassination in 1979, overseeing rapid export-led economic growth as well as implementing political repression.', u'Park was heavily criticised as a ruthless military dictator, who in 1972 extended his rule by creating a new constitution, which gave the president sweeping (almost dictatorial) powers and permitted him to run for an unlimited number of six-year terms.', u"However, the Korean economy developed significantly during Park's tenure and the government developed the nationwide expressway system, the Seoul subway system, and laid the foundation for economic development during his 17-year tenure.", u"The years after Park's assassination were marked again by political turmoil, as the previously suppressed opposition leaders all campaigned to run for president in the sudden political void.", u"In 1979 there came the Coup d'\xe9tat of December Twelfth led by General Chun Doo-hwan.", u"Following the Coup d'\xe9tat, Chun Doo-hwan planned to rise to power through several measures.", u'On May 17, Chun Doo-hwan forced the Cabinet to expand martial law to the whole nation, which had previously not applied to the island of Jejudo.', u'The expanded martial law closed universities, banned political activities and further curtailed the press.', u"Chun's assumption of the presidency in the events of May 17, triggered nationwide protests demanding democracy, in particular in the city of Gwangju, to which Chun sent special forces to violently suppress the Gwangju Democratization Movement.", u'Chun subsequently created the National Defense Emergency Policy Committee and took the presidency according to his political plan.', u'Chun and his government held South Korea under a despotic rule until 1987, when a Seoul National University student, Park Jong-chul, was tortured to death.', u'On June 10, the Catholic Priests Association for Justice revealed the incident, igniting the June Democracy Movement around the country.', u"Eventually, Chun's party, the Democratic Justice Party, and its leader, Roh Tae-woo announced the 6.29 Declaration, which included the direct election of the president.", u'Roh went on to win the election by a narrow margin against the two main opposition leaders, Kim Dae-Jung and Kim Young-Sam.', u'In 1988, Seoul hosted the 1988 Summer Olympics.', u'It became a member of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 1996.', u'It was adversely affected by the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis.', u'However, the country recovered and continued its economic growth, albeit at a slower pace.', u'In June 2000, as part of president Kim Dae-jung\'s "Sunshine Policy" of engagement, a North\u2013South summit took place in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea.', u'Later that year, Kim received the Nobel Peace Prize "for his work for democracy and human rights in South Korea and in East Asia in general, and for peace and reconciliation with North Korea in particular."', u'However, because of discontent among the population for fruitless approaches to the North under the previous administrations and, amid North Korean provocations, a conservative government was elected in 2007 led by President Lee Myung-bak, former mayor of Seoul.', u'More recently, Park Geun-hye won the South Korean presidential election, 2012.', u'In 2002, South Korea and Japan jointly co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup.', u'However, South Korean and Japanese relations later soured because of conflicting claims of sovereignty over the Liancourt Rocks, in what became known as the Liancourt Rocks dispute.', u"In 2016, a South-Korean political scandal raised accusing President Park Geun-hye's administration for the involvement of Choi Soon Li in state affairs, wherefore Soon Li was officially charged in November 2016.", u'Following the scandal, there has been a serie of massive demonstrations that started in the first week of November 2016.', u'== Geography, climate and environment ==\n\n\n=== Geography ===\n\nSouth Korea occupies the southern portion of the Korean Peninsula, which extends some 1,100 km (680 mi) from the Asian mainland.', u'This mountainous peninsula is flanked by the Yellow Sea to the west, and the East Sea to

130\xb0E.', u'Its total area is 100,032 square kilometres (38,622.57 sq mi).', u'South Korea can be divided into four general regions: an eastern region of high mountain ranges and narrow coastal plains; a western region of broad coastal plains, river basins, and rolling hills; a southwestern region of mountains and valleys; and a southeastern region dominated by the broad basin of the Nakdong River.', u"South Korea's terrain is mostly mountainous, most of which is not arable.", u'Lowlands, located primarily in the west and southeast, make up only 30% of the total land area.', u'About three thousand islands, mostly small and uninhabited, lie off the western and southern coasts of South Korea.', u'Jeju-do is about 100 kilometres (62 miles) off the southern coast of South Korea.', u"It is the country's largest island, with an area of 1,845 square kilometres (712 square miles).", u"Jeju is also the site of South Korea's highest point: Hallasan, an extinct volcano, reaches 1,950 metres

to late summer typhoons that bring strong winds, heavy rains and sometime floods.', u'The average annual precipitation varies from 1,370 millimetres (54 in) in Seoul to 1,470 millimetres (58 in) in Busan.', u"=== Environment ===\n\nDuring the first 20 years of South Korea's growth surge, little effort was made to preserve the environment.", u'Unchecked industrialization and urban development have resulted in deforestation and the ongoing destruction of wetlands such as the Songdo Tidal Flat.', u'However, there have been recent efforts to balance these problems, including a government run $84 billion five-year green growth project that aims to boost energy efficiency and green technology.', u"The green-based economic strategy is a comprehensive overhaul of South Korea's economy, utilizing nearly two percent of the national GDP.", u'The greening initiative includes such efforts as a nationwide bike network, solar and wind energy, lowering oil dependent vehicles, backing daylight savings and extensive usage of environmentally friendly technologies such as LEDs in electronics and lighting.', u"The country \u2013 already the world's most wired \u2013 plans to build a nationwide next-generation network which will be 10 times faster than broadband facilities in order to reduce energy usage.", u'The renewable portfolio standard program with renewable energy certificates runs from 2012 to 2022.', u'Quota systems favor large, vertically integrated generators and multinational electric utilities, if only because certificates are generally denominated in units of one megawatt-hour.', u'They are also more difficult to design and implement than a Feed-in tariff.', u'Around 350 residential micro combined heat and power units were installed in 2012.', u'Seoul\'s tap water recently became safe to drink, with city officials branding it "Arisu" in a bid to convince the public.', u'Efforts have also been made with afforestation projects.', u'Another multibillion-dollar project was the restoration of Cheonggyecheon, a stream running through downtown Seoul that had earlier been paved over by a motorway.', u'One major challenge is air quality, with acid rain, sulfur oxides, and annual yellow dust storms being particular problems.', u"It is acknowledged that many of these difficulties are a result of South Korea's proximity to China, which is a major air polluter.", u'South Korea is a member of the Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity Treaty, Kyoto Protocol (forming the Environmental Integrity Group (EIG), regarding UNFCCC, with Mexico and Switzerland), Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty

executive and legislative bodies of their own.', u'The judicial branch operates at both the national and local levels.', u'South Korea is a constitutional democracy.', u"The South Korean government's structure is determined by the Constitution of the Republic of Korea.", u'This document has been revised several times since its first promulgation in 1948 at independence.', u'However, it has retained many broad characteristics and with the exception of the short-lived Second Republic of South Korea, the country has always had a presidential system with an independent chief executive.', u'The first direct election was also held in 1948.', u'Although South Korea experienced a series of military dictatorships from the 1960s up until the 1980s, it has since developed into a successful

Demographics ==\n\nIn April 2016, South Korea's population was estimated to be around 50.8 million by National Statistical Office, with continuing decline of working age population and total fertility rate.", u'The country is noted for its population density, which was an estimated 505 per square kilometer in 2015, more than 10 times the global average.', u"Most South Koreans live in urban areas, because of rapid migration from the countryside during the country's quick economic expansion in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.", u"The capital city of Seoul is also the country's largest city and chief industrial center.", u'According to the 2005 census, Seoul had a population of 10 million inhabitants.', u"The Seoul National Capital Area has 24.5 million inhabitants (about half of South Korea's entire population) making it the world's second largest metropolitan area.", u'Other major cities include Busan (3.5 million), Incheon (2.5 million), Daegu (2.5 million), Daejeon (1.4 million), Gwangju (1.4 million) and Ulsan (1.1 million).', u'The population has also been shaped by international migration.', u'After World War II and the division of the Korean Peninsula, about four million people from North Korea crossed the border to South Korea.', u'This trend of net entry reversed over the next 40 years because of emigration, especially to the United States and Canada.', u"South Korea's total population in 1955 was 21.5 million, and has more than doubled, to 50 million, by 2010.", u'South Korea is one of the most ethnically homogeneous societies in the world, with more than 99% of inhabitants having Korean ethnicity.', u'The percentage of foreign nationals has been growing rapidly.', u'As of 2009, South Korea had 1,106,884 foreign residents, 2.7% of the population; however, more than half of them are ethnic Koreans with a foreign citizenship.', u'For example, migrants from China (PRC) make up 56.5% of foreign nationals, but approximately 70% of the Chinese citizens in Korea are Joseonjok (\uc870\uc120\uc871 in Korean), PRC citizens of Korean ethnicity.', u'Regardless of the ethnicity, there are 28,500 US military personnel serving in South Korea, most serving a one-year unaccompanied tour (though approximately 10% serve longer tours accompanied by family), according to the Korea National Statistical Office.', u'In addition, about 43,000 English

42.3 million in 2050.', u"South Korea's annual birthrate is approximately 9 births per 1000 people.", u"However, the birthrate has increased by 5.7% in 2010 and Korea no longer has the world's lowest birthrate.", u"According to a 2011 report from Chosun Ilbo, South Korea's total fertility rate (1.23 children born per woman) is higher than those of Taiwan (1.15) and Japan (1.21).", u'The average life expectancy in 2008 was 79.10 years, (which was 34th in the world) but by 2015 it had increased to around 81.', u'South Korea has the steepest decline in working age population of the OECD nations.', u'In 2015, National Statistical Office estimated that the population of the country would reach its peak by 2030.', u'=== Education ===\n\nA centralized administration in South Korea oversees the process for the education of children from kindergarten to the third and final year of high school.', u'The school year is divided into two semesters, the first of which begins in the beginning of March and ends in mid-July, the second of which begins in late August and ends in mid-February.', u'The schedules are not uniformly standardized and vary from school to school.', u'Most South Korean middle schools and high schools have school uniforms, modeled on western-style uniforms.', u"Boys' uniforms usually consists of trousers and white shirts, and girls wear skirts and white shirts (this only applies in middle schools and high schools).", u'The country adopted a new educational program to increase the number of their foreign students through 2010.', u'According to the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, the number of scholarships for foreign students in South Korea would have (under the program) doubled by that time, and the number of foreign students would have reached 100,000.', u'South Korea is the top-performing OECD country in reading literacy, maths and sciences with the average student scoring 542 and has one of the worlds highest-educated labour forces among OECD countries.', u'The country is well known for its high feverish outlook on education, where it\'s national obsession with education has been called "education fever".', u'Higher education is an overwhelmingly serious issue in South Korea society, where it is viewed as one of the fundamental cornerstones of South Korean life.', u"Education remains a high priority for South Korean families as success in education holds a cultural status as well as a necessity to improve one's socioeconomic position in South Korean society.", u'Academic success is often a source of pride for families and within South Korean society at large.', u'South Koreans view education as the main propeller of social mobility for themselves and their family as a gateway to the South Korean middle class.', u'Graduating from a top university is the ultimate marker of prestige, high socioeconomic status, promising marriage prospects, and a respectable career path.', u"An average South Korean child's life revolves around education as pressure to succeed academically is deeply ingrained in South Korean children from an early age.", u'Not having a university degree carries a major cultural stigma as those without university degrees face social prejudice and are often looked down upon by others.', u'In 2015, the country spent 4.7% of its GDP on all levels of education \u2013 roughly equal to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) average of 4.7% also.', u'A strong investment in education, a militant drive for success as well as the passion for excellence has helped the country rapidly grow its economy over the past 60 years from a war torn wasteland.', u'South Korea\u2019s zeal for education and its students\u2019 desires to get into a prestigious university is one of the highest in the world, as the entrance into a top tier higher educational institution leads to a prestigious, secure and well-paid white collar job with the government, banks, a major South Korean conglomerate such as Samsung, Hyundai or LG Electronics.', u'With incredible pressure on high school students to secure places at the nation\u2019s best universities, its institutional reputation and alumni networks are strong predictors of future career prospects.', u'The top three universities in South Korea, often referred to as "SKY", are Seoul National University, Korea University and Yonsei University.', u'Intense competition for top grades and academic pressure to be the top student is deeply ingrained in the psyche of South Korean students at a young age.', u'Yet with only so many places at universities and even fewer places at top-tier companies, many young people remain disappointed and are often unwilling to lower their sights.', u"Those who do not choose to go to university can feel as underachievers as not having a university degree carries a major taboo in South Korean society where those who don't hold university degrees are looked down by others as second-class citizens resulting fewer opportunities for employment, improvement of one's socioeconomic position and prospects for marriage.", u'International reception on the South Korean education system has been divided.', u"It has been praised for various reasons, including its comparatively high test results and its major role in ushering South Korea's economic development creating one of the world\u2019s most educated workforces.", u"South Korea's highly enviable academic performance has gotten British education ministers actively remodeling their own curriculum's and exams to try to emulate Korea's militant drive and passion for excellence and high educational achievement.", u"U.S. President Barack Obama has also praised the country's rigorous school system, where over 80 percent of South Korean high school graduates go on to college.", u"The nation's high university entrance rate has created a highly skilled workforce making South Korea among the most educated countries in the world with the one of the highest percentage of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree.", u"Bachelor's degrees are held by 68 percent of South Koreans aged 25\u201334, the most in the OECD.", u'The system\'s rigid and hierarchical structure has been criticized for stifling creativity and innovation; described as intensely and "brutally" competitive, The system is often blamed for the high suicide rate in the country, particularly the growing rates among those aged 10\u201319.', u"Various media outlets attribute the nations high suicide rate on the nationwide anxiety around the country's college entrance exams, which determine the trajectory of students entire lives and careers.", u'Former South Korean hagwon teacher Se-Woong Koo wrote that the South Korean education system amounts to child abuse and that it should be "reformed and restructured without delay."', u'The system has also been criticized for producing an oversupply of university graduates creating an overeducated and underemployed labor force; in the first quarter of 2013 alone, nearly 3.3 million South Korean university graduates were jobless, leading many graduates overqualified for jobs requiring less education.', u'Further criticism has been stemmed for causing labor shortages in various skilled labor and vocational occupations, where many of which go unfilled as the negative social stigma associated with vocational careers and not having a university degree continues to remain deep-rooted in South Korean society.', u'=== Religion ===\n\nAs of 2005, just under half of the South Korean population expressed no religious preference.', u'Of the rest, most are Buddhist or Christian.', u'According to the 2007 census, 29.2% of the

movements such as Jeungsanism, Cheondoism and Wonbuddhism.', u'The earliest religion practiced was Korean shamanism.', u'Today, freedom of religion is guaranteed by the constitution, and there is no state religion.', u"There is a conflict however with the long established requirement of mandatory military service which leads to the imprisonment of conscientious objectors, thereby causing many Jehovah's Witnesses to be imprisoned in South Korea for refusing on the same grounds of conscientious objection.", u'The UN Human Rights Committee has determined that the government of South Korea uses arbitrary detention for conscientious objectors and should take steps to resolve the issue.', u"Christianity is South Korea's largest religion, accounting for more than half of all South Korean religious adherents.", u'There are approximately 13.7 million Christians in South Korea today; about 63% of Korean Christians belong to Protestant churches, while 37% belong to the Roman Catholic

Kingdoms Period, when Goguryeo adopted it as the state religion in 372, followed by Baekje (528).', u'Buddhism had been the state religion of Unified Silla from the North South States Period (not to be confused with the modern division of Korea) to Goryeo before suppression under the Joseon dynasty in favor of Neo-Confucianism.', u'Fewer than 30,000 South Koreans are thought to be Muslims, but the country has some 100,000 resident foreign workers from Islamic countries such as Bangladesh, Indonesia and Pakistan.', u'Korean shamanism, today known as Muism (religion of the mu [shamans]) or Sinism (religion of the gods) encompasses a variety of indigenous religious beliefs and practices of the Korean people and the Korean sphere.', u'In contemporary South Korea, the most used term is Muism and a shaman is known as a mudang (\ubb34\ub2f9, \u5deb\u5802) or Tangol (\ub2f9\uace8).', u'Since the early 2000s, this religion has regained popularity among Koreans.', u'=== Health ===\n\nSouth Korea has a universal healthcare system.', u'Korean hospitals have advanced medical equipment and facilities readily available, ranking 4th for MRI units per capita and 6th for CT scanners per capita in the OECD.', u"It also had the OECD's second largest number of hospital beds per 1000 people at 9.56 beds, which was over triple that of Sweden's 2.71, Canada's 2.75, the UK's

Assistance Committee, marking the first time a former aid recipient country joined the group as a donor member.', u'South Korea hosted the G-20 Summit in Seoul in November 2010.', u'=== China ===\n\nHistorically, Korea has had close relations with China.', u'Before the formation of South Korea, Korean independence fighters worked with Chinese soldiers during the Japanese occupation.', u"However, after World War II, the People's Republic of China embraced Maoism while South Korea sought close relations with the United States.", u'The PRC assisted North Korea with manpower and supplies during the Korean War, and in its aftermath the diplomatic relationship between South Korea and the PRC almost completely ceased.', u'Relations thawed gradually and South Korea and the PRC re-established formal diplomatic relations on August 24, 1992.', u'The two countries sought to improve bilateral relations and lifted the forty-year-old trade embargo, and South Korean\u2013Chinese relations have improved steadily since 1992.', u"The Republic of Korea broke off official relations with the Republic of China (Taiwan) upon gaining official relations with the People's Republic of China, which doesn't recognise Taiwan's sovereignty.", u'=== European Union ===\n\nThe European Union (EU) and South Korea are important trading partners, having negotiated a free trade agreement for many years since South Korea was designated as a priority FTA partner in 2006.', u'The free trade agreement was approved in September 2010, and took effect on July 1, 2011.', u"South Korea is the EU's eighth largest trade partner, and the EU has become South Korea's second largest export destination.", u'EU trade with South Korea exceeded \u20ac65 billion in 2008 and has enjoyed an annual average growth rate of 7.5% between 2004 and 2008.', u'The EU has been the single largest foreign investor in South Korea since 1962, and accounted for almost 45% of all FDI inflows into Korea in 2006.', u'Nevertheless, EU companies have significant problems accessing and operating in the South Korean market because of stringent standards and testing requirements for products and services often creating barriers to trade.', u'Both in its regular bilateral contacts with South Korea and through its FTA with Korea, the EU is seeking to improve this situation.', u'=== Japan ===\n\nAlthough there were no formal diplomatic ties between South Korea and Japan after the end of World War II, South Korea and Japan signed the Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea in 1965 to establish diplomatic ties.', u'There is heavy anti-Japanese sentiment in South Korea because of a number of unsettled Japanese-Korean disputes, many of which stem from the period of Japanese occupation after the Japanese annexation of Korea.', u'During World War II, more than 100,000 Koreans served in the Imperial Japanese Army.', u'Korean women were forced to the war front to serve the Imperial Japanese Army as sexual slaves, called comfort women.', u'Longstanding issues such as Japanese war crimes against Korean civilians, visits by Japanese politicians to Yasukuni Shrine honoring Japanese soldiers killed at war (including some class A war criminals), the negationist re-writing of Japanese textbooks relating Japanese atrocities during World War II, and the territorial disputes over Liancourt Rocks, known in South Korea as "Dokdo", continue to trouble Korean-Japanese relations.', u'Although Dokdo is claimed by both South Korea and Japan, the islets are administered by South Korea, which had its coast guard stationed there.', u"In response to then-Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's visits to Yasukuni Shrine, former President Roh Moo-hyun suspended all summit talks between South Korea and Japan in 2009.", u'=== North Korea ===\n\nBoth North and South Korea continue to officially claim sovereignty over the entire peninsula and any outlying islands.', u'Despite the animosity, reconciliation efforts have been present from the very beginning of the separation between North and South Korea.', u'Political figures such as Kim Koo worked to reconcile the two governments even after the Korean War.', u'With longstanding animosity following the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, North Korea and South Korea signed an agreement to pursue peace.', u'On October 4, 2007, Roh Moo-Hyun and North Korean leader Kim Jong-il signed an eight-point agreement on issues of permanent peace, high-level talks, economic cooperation, renewal of train services, highway and air travel, and a joint Olympic cheering squad.', u'Despite the Sunshine Policy and efforts at reconciliation, the progress was complicated by North Korean missile tests in 1993, 1998, 2006, 2009, and 2013.', u'As of early 2009, relationships between North and South Korea were very tense; North Korea had been reported to have deployed missiles, ended its former agreements with South Korea, and threatened South Korea and the United States not to interfere with a satellite launch it had planned.', u"North and South Korea are still technically at war (having never signed a peace treaty after the Korean War) and share the world's most heavily fortified border.", u'On May 27, 2009, North Korean media declared that the Armistice is no longer valid because of the South Korean government\'s pledge to "definitely join" the Proliferation Security Initiative.', u'To further complicate and intensify strains between the two nations, the sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan in March 2010, is affirmed by the South Korean government to have been caused by a North Korean torpedo, which the North denies.', u'President Lee Myung-bak declared in May 2010 that Seoul would cut all trade with North Korea as part of measures primarily aimed at striking back at North Korea diplomatically and financially, except for the joint Kaesong Industrial Project, and humanitarian aid.', u'North Korea initially threatened to sever all ties, to completely abrogate the previous pact of non-aggression, and to expel all South Koreans from a joint industrial zone in Kaesong, but backtracked on its threats and decided to continue its ties with South Korea.', u'Despite the continuing ties, Kaesong industrial zone has seen a large decrease in investment and manpower as a result of this military conflict.', u"In February 2016, the Kaesong complex was closed by Seoul in reaction to North Korea's launch of a rocket earlier in the month unanimously condemned by the United Nations security council.", u'=== United States ===\n\nThe United States engaged in the decolonization of Korea (mainly in the South, with the Soviet Union engaged in North Korea) from Japan after World War II.', u'After three years of military administration by the United States, the South Korean government was established.', u'Upon the onset of the Korean War, U.S. forces were sent to defend against an invasion from North Korea of the South.', u'Following the Armistice, South Korea and the U.S. agreed to a "Mutual Defense Treaty", under which an attack on either party in the Pacific area would summon a response from both.', u'In 1967, South Korea obliged the mutual defense treaty, by sending a large combat troop contingent to support the United States in the Vietnam War.', u'The U.S. Eighth Army, Seventh Air Force, and U.S.', u'Naval Forces Korea are stationed in South Korea.', u"The two nations have strong economic, diplomatic, and military ties, although they have at times disagreed with regard to policies towards North Korea, and with regard to some of South Korea's industrial activities that involve usage of rocket or nuclear technology.", u'There had also been strong anti-American sentiment during certain periods, which has largely moderated in the modern day.', u'In 2007, a free trade agreement known as the Republic of Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA) was signed between South Korea and the United States, but its formal implementation was repeatedly delayed, pending approval by the legislative bodies of the two countries.', u'On October 12, 2011, the U.S. Congress passed the long-stalled trade agreement with South Korea.', u'It went into effect on March 15, 2012.', u'== Military ==\n\nA long history of invasions by neighbors and the unresolved tension with North Korea have prompted South Korea to allocate 2.6% of its GDP and 15% of all government spending to its military (Government share of GDP: 14.967%), while maintaining compulsory conscription for men.', u"Consequently, South Korea has the world's sixth largest number of active troops (650,000 in 2011), the world's second-largest number of reserve troops (3,200,000 in 2011) and the eleventh largest defense budget.", u"The Republic of Korea, with both regular and reserve military force numbering 3.7 million regular personnel among a total national population of 50 million people, has the second highest number of soldiers per capita in the world, after the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.", u'The South Korean military consists of the Army (ROKA), the Navy (ROKN), the Air Force (ROKAF), and the Marine Corps (ROKMC), and reserve forces.', u'Many of these forces are concentrated near the Korean Demilitarized Zone.', u'All South Korean males are constitutionally required to serve in the military, typically 21 months.', u'Previously, Koreans of mixed race were exempt from military duty but no exception from 2011.', u"In addition to male conscription in South Korea's sovereign military, 1,800 Korean males are selected every year to serve 21 months in the KATUSA Program to further augment the United States Forces Korea (USFK).", u'In 2010, South Korea was spending \u20a91.68 trillion in a cost-sharing agreement with the US to provide budgetary support to the US forces in Korea, on top of the \u20a929.6 trillion budget for its own military.', u"The South Korean army has 2,500 tanks in operation, including the K1A1 and K2 Black Panther, which form the backbone of the South Korean army's mechanized armor and infantry forces.", u'A sizable arsenal of many artillery systems, including 1,700 self-propelled K55 and K9 Thunder howitzers and 680 helicopters and UAVs of numerous types, are assembled to provide additional fire, reconnaissance, and logistics support.', u"South Korea's smaller but more advanced artillery force and wide range of airborne reconnaissance platforms are pivotal in the counter-battery suppression of North Korea's large artillery force, which operates more than 13,000 artillery systems deployed in various state of fortification and mobility.", u"The South Korean navy has made its first major transformation into a blue-water navy through the formation of the Strategic Mobile Fleet, which includes a battle group of Chungmugong Yi Sun-sin class destroyers, Dokdo class amphibious assault ship, AIP-driven Type 214 submarines, and King Sejong the Great class destroyers, which is equipped with the latest baseline of Aegis fleet-defense system that allows the ships to track and destroy

F/A-50, supported by well-maintained fleets of older fighters such as F-4E and KF-5E/F that still effectively serve the air force alongside the more modern aircraft.", u"In an attempt to gain strength in terms of not just numbers but also modernity, the commissioning of four Boeing 737 AEW&C aircraft, under Project Peace Eye for centralized intelligence gathering and analysis on a modern battlefield, will enhance the fighters' and other support aircraft's ability to perform their missions with awareness and precision.", u"In May 2011, Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd., South Korea's

forces and the entire South Korean military \u2013 if a sudden escalation of war between North and South Korea were to occur the United States would assume control of the South Korean armed forces in all military and paramilitary moves.', u'However, in September 2006, the Presidents of the United States and the Republic of Korea agreed that South Korea should assume the lead for its own defense.',

in South Korea.", u"It may also help improve the country's sovereign credit rating.", u"Despite the South Korean economy's high growth potential and apparent structural stability, the country suffers damage to its credit rating in the stock market because of the belligerence of North Korea in times of deep military crises, which has an adverse effect on South Korean financial markets.", u'The

u'South Korea is also preparing to bid on construction of a light-water nuclear reactor for Argentina.', u'South Korea is not allowed to enrich uranium or develop traditional uranium enrichment technology on its own, because of US political pressure, unlike most major nuclear powers such as Japan, Germany, and France, competitors of South Korea in the international nuclear market.', u"This impediment to South Korea's indigenous nuclear industrial undertaking has sparked occasional diplomatic rows between the two allies.", u'While South Korea is successful in exporting its

and technology ==\n\nScientific and technological development in the South Korea at first did not occur largely because of more pressing matters such as the division of Korea and the Korean War that occurred right after its independence.', u"It wasn't until the 1960s under the dictatorship of Park Chung-hee where South Korea's economy rapidly grew from industrialisation and the Chaebol corporations such as Samsung and LG.", u"Ever since the industrialization of South Korea's economy, South Korea has placed its focus on technology-based corporations, which has been supported by

January 2013 was successful.', u'The government plans to develop Naro-2 by the year 2018.', u"South Korea's efforts to build an indigenous space launch vehicle is marred because of persistent political pressure of the United States, who had for many decades hindered South Korea's indigenous rocket and missile development programs in fear of their possible connection to clandestine military ballistic missile programs, which Korea many times insisted did not violate the research and development guidelines stipulated by US-Korea agreements on restriction of South Korean rocket technology research and development.", u'South Korea has sought the assistance of foreign countries such as Russia through MTCR commitments to supplement its restricted domestic rocket technology.', u'The two

first successful cloning of a dog, Snuppy (in 2005), and the cloning of two females of an endangered species of wolves by the Seoul National University in 2007.', u'The rapid growth of the industry has resulted in significant voids in regulation of ethics, as was highlighted by the scientific misconduct case involving Hwang Woo-Suk.', u'== Culture ==\n\nSouth Korea shares its traditional culture with North Korea, but the two Koreas have developed distinct contemporary forms of culture since the peninsula was divided in 1945.', u'Historically, while the culture of Korea has been heavily influenced by that of neighboring China, it has nevertheless managed to develop a unique cultural identity that is distinct from its larger neighbor.', u'The South Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism actively encourages the traditional arts, as well as modern forms, through funding and education programs.', u'The industrialization and urbanization of South Korea have brought many

the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out.", u'From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States.', u'A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War.', u'Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force.', u'It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military.', u'Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established.', u"The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.", u'The U.S. military is one of the largest militaries in terms of number of personnel.', u'It draws its personnel from a large pool of paid volunteers; although conscription has been used in the past in various times of both war and peace, it has not been used since 1972.', u'As of 2016, the United States spends about $580.3 billion annually to fund its military forces and Overseas Contingency Operations.', u"Put together, the United States constitutes roughly 40 percent of the world's military expenditures.", u"For the period 2010\u201314, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) found that the United States was the world's largest exporter of major arms, accounting for 31 per cent of global shares.", u"The United States was also the world's eighth largest importer of major weapons for the same period.", u'The U.S. military has significant capabilities in both defense and power projection due to its large budget, resulting in advanced and powerful equipment, and its widespread deployment of force around the world, including about 800 military bases in foreign locations.', u'== History ==\n\nThe history of the U.S. military dates to 1775, even before the Declaration of Independence marked the establishment of the United States.', u'The Continental Army, Continental Navy, and Continental Marines were created in close succession by the Second Continental Congress in order to defend the new nation against the British Empire in the American Revolutionary War.', u'These forces demobilized in 1784 after the Treaty of Paris ended the War for Independence.', u'The Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, and the United States Congress created the United States Navy on 27 March 1794, and the United States Marine Corps on 11 July 1798.', u'All three services trace their origins to the founding of the Continental Army (on 14 June 1775), the Continental Navy (on 13 October 1775) and the Continental Marines (on 10 November 1775), respectively.', u'The 1787 adoption of the Constitution gave the Congress the power to "raise and support armies", "provide and maintain a navy", and to "make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces", as well as the power to declare war.', u"The United States President is the U.S. military's commander-in-chief.", u'Rising tensions at various times with Britain and France and the ensuing Quasi-War and War of 1812 quickened the development of the U.S. Navy (established 13 October 1775) and the United States Marine Corps (established 10 November 1775).', u'The U.S. Coast Guard dates its origin to the founding of the Revenue Cutter Service on 4 August 1790; that service merged with the United States Life-Saving Service in 1915 to establish the Coast Guard.', u'The United States Air Force was established as an independent service on 18 September 1947; it traces its origin to the formation of the Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps in 1907 and was part of the Army before becoming an independent service.', u'The reserve branches formed a military strategic reserve during the Cold War, to be called into service in case of war.', u"Time magazine's Mark Thompson has suggested that with the War on Terror, the reserves deployed as a single force with the active branches and America no longer has a strategic reserve.", u'== Command structure ==\n\nCommand over the armed forces is established in the United States Constitution.', u'The sole power of command is vested in the President by Article II as Commander-in-Chief.', u'The Constitution also allows for the creation of "executive Departments" headed "principal officers" whose opinion the President can require.', u'This allowance in the Constitution formed the basis for creation of the Department of Defense in 1947 by the National Security Act.', u'The Defense Department is headed by the Secretary of Defense, who is a civilian and member of the Cabinet.', u"The Defense Secretary is second in the military's chain of command, just below the President, and serves as the principal assistant to the President in all defense-related matters.", u'Together, the President and the Secretary of Defense comprise the National Command Authority, which by law, is the ultimate lawful source of military orders.', u'To coordinate military strategy with political affairs, the President has a National Security Council headed by the National Security Advisor.', u'The collective body has only advisory power to the President, but several of the members who statutorily comprise the council (the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Energy, and the Secretary of Defense) possess executive authority over their own departments.', u"Just as the President and the Secretary of Defense are in charge of the entire military establishment, maintaining civilian control of the military, so too are each of the Defense Department's constitutive military departments headed by civilians.", u'The five branches are organized into three departments, each with civilian heads.', u'The Department of the Army is headed by the Secretary of the Army, the Department of the Navy is headed by the Secretary of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force is headed by the Secretary of the Air Force.', u'The Marine Corps is organized under the Department of the Navy.', u'The Coast Guard is not under the administration of the Defense Department, but the Department of Homeland Security and receives its operational orders from the Secretary of Homeland Security.', u'However, the Coast Guard may be transferred to the Department of the Navy by the President or Congress during a time of war, thereby placing it within the Defense Department.', u'The President, Secretary of Defense, and other senior executive officials are advised by a seven-member Joint Chiefs of Staff, which is headed by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the highest-ranking officer in the United States military, and the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.', u"The rest of the body is composed of the heads of each of the Defense Department's service branches (the Chief of Staff of the Army, the Chief of Naval Operations, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force) as well as the Chief of the National Guard Bureau.", u'Although commanding one of the five military branches, the Commandant of the Coast Guard is not a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.', u'Despite being composed of the highest-ranking officers in each of the respective branches, the Joint Chiefs of Staff does not possess operational command authority.', u'Rather, the Goldwater-Nichols Act charges them only with advisory power.', u'All of the branches work together during operations and joint missions in Unified Combatant Commands, under the authority of the Secretary of Defense with the exception of the Coast Guard.', u'Each of the Unified Combatant Commands is headed by a Combatant Commander, a senior commissioned officer who exercises supreme command authority per 10 U.S.C.', u'\xa7 164 over all of the forces, regardless of branch, within his geographical or functional command.', u'By statute, the chain of command flows from the President to the Secretary of Defense to each of the Combatant Commanders.', u'In practice, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff often acts as an intermediary between the Secretary of Defense and the Combatant Commanders.', u'All five armed services are among the seven uniformed services of the United States, the two others being the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps (under the Department of Health and Human Services) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps (under the Department of Commerce).', u"== Budget ==\n\nThe United States has the world's largest military budget.", u'In the fiscal year 2016, $580.3 billion in funding were enacted for the Department of Defense (DoD) and for "Overseas Contingency Operations" in the War on Terrorism.', u'Outside of direct DoD spending, the United States spends another $218 to $262 billion each year on other defense-related programs, such as Veterans Affairs, Homeland Security, nuclear weapons maintenance, and the State Department.', u'By service, $146.9 billion was allocated for the Army, $168.8 billion for the Navy and Marine Corps, $161.8 billion for the Air Force and $102.8 billion for defense-wide spending.', u'By function, $138.6 billion was requested for personnel, $244.4 billion for operations and maintenance, $118.9 billion for procurement, $69.0 billion for research and development, $1.3 billion for revolving and management funds, $6.9 billion for military construction, and $1.3 billion for family housing.', u'In FY 2009, major defense programs saw continued funding:\n$4.1 billion was requested for the next-generation fighter, F-22 Raptor, which was to roll out an additional 20 planes in 2009\n$6.7 billion was requested for the F-35 Lightning II, which is still under development, but 16 planes were slated to be built\nThe Future Combat System program is expected to see $3.6 billion for its development.', u'A total of $12.3 billion was requested for missile defense, including Patriot CAP, PAC-3 and SBIRS-High.', u'Loren Thompson, a defense analyst with the Lexington Institute, has blamed the "vast sums of money" squandered on cutting-edge technology projects that were then canceled on shortsighted political operatives who lack a long-term perspective in setting requirements.', u'The result is that the number of items bought under a given program are cut.', u'The total development costs of the program are divided over fewer platforms, making the per-unit cost seem higher and so the numbers are cut again and again in a death spiral.', u"Although the United States was the world's biggest exporter of major weapons in 2010\u201314, the US was also the world's eight biggest importer during the same period.", u'US arms imports increased by 21 per cent between 2005\u20132009 and 2010\u201314.', u"Cost containment measures in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Obama administration's energy policy will play critical determining roles because health care and fuel costs are the two fastest-growing segments of the defense budget.", u'== Personnel ==\n\nThe projected active duty end strength in the armed forces for FY 2017 was 1,281,900 people, with an additional 801,200 people in the seven reserve components.', u"It is an all-volunteer military, but conscription through the Selective Service System can be enacted at the President's request and Congress' approval.", u'All males ages 18 through 25 who are living in the United States are required to register with the Selective Service for a potential future draft.', u"The U.S. military is the world's second largest, after China's People's Liberation Army, and has troops deployed around the globe.", u'From 1776 until September 2012, a total of 40 million people have served in the United States Armed Forces.', u'The FY 2017 DoD budget request plan calls for an active duty end strength of 1,281,900, a decrease of 19,400 from the 2016 baseline as a result of decrements in the Army (15,000 fewer personnel) and Navy (4,400 fewer personnel) strength.', u'The budget request also calls for a reserve component end strength of 801,200, a decrease of 9,800 personnel.', u'As in most militaries, members of the U.S. military hold a rank, either that of officer, warrant, or enlisted, to determine seniority and eligibility for promotion.', u'Those who have served are known as veterans.', u'Rank names may be different between services, but they are matched to each other by their corresponding paygrade.', u'Officers who hold the same rank or paygrade are distinguished by their date of rank to determine seniority, while officers who serve in certain positions of office of importance set by law, outrank all other officers in active duty of the same rank and paygrade, regardless of their date of rank.', u'Currently, only one in four persons in the United States of the proper age meet the moral, academic and physical standards for military service.', u'=== Personnel in each service ===\n2010 Demographic Reports and end strengths for reserve components.', u'(should be updated using 2011 Demographic Reports and Dec.2011 DMDC military personnel data)\n\nThese numbers do not take into account the use of Private Military and Private Security Companies (PSCs).', u"Quarterly PSC census reports are available for United States Central Command (USCENTCOM)'s area of operations\u2014i.e., Iraq and Afghanistan.", u'As of March 2011, there were 18,971 private security contractor (PSC) personnel in Afghanistan working for DoD; in Iraq, there were 9,207 PSC personnel, down from a high of 15,279 in June 2009.', u'As of October 2012, in Afghanistan, there were 18,914 PSC personnel working for DoD; in Iraq, there were 2,116 PSC personnel.', u'The total number of DoD contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan was more than 137,400; reported PSCs were only a part of the number.', u'=== Personnel stationing ===\n\n\n==== Overseas ====\n\nAs of 31 December 2010, U.S. armed forces were stationed in 150 countries; the number of non-contingent deployments per country ranges from 1 in Suriname to over 50,000 in Germany.', u'Some of the largest deployments are: 103,700 in Afghanistan, 52,440 in Germany (see list), 35,688 in Japan (USFJ), 28,500 in South Korea (USFK), 9,660 in Italy, and 9,015 in the United Kingdom.', u'These numbers change frequently due to the regular recall and deployment of units.', u'Altogether, 77,917 military personnel are located in Europe, 141 in the former Soviet Union, 47,236 in East Asia and the Pacific, 3,362 in North Africa, the Near East, and South Asia, 1,355 in sub-Saharan Africa and 1,941 in the Western Hemisphere excluding the United States itself.', u'==== Within the United States ====\nIncluding U.S. territories and ships afloat within territorial waters\nAs of 31 December 2009, a total of 1,137,568 personnel were on active duty within the United States and its territories (including 84,461 afloat).', u'The vast majority (941,629 personnel) were stationed at bases within the contiguous United States.', u'There were an additional 37,245 in Hawaii and 20,450 in Alaska; 84,461 were at sea, 2,972 in Guam, and 179 in Puerto Rico.', u'=== Types of personnel ===\n\n\n==== Enlisted ====\n\nProspective service members are often recruited from high school or college, the target age ranges being 18\u201335 in the Army, 18\u201328 in the Marine Corps, 18\u201334 in the Navy, 18\u201339 in the Air Force, and 18\u201327 (up to age 32 if qualified for attending guaranteed "A" school) in the Coast Guard.', u"With the permission of a parent or guardian, applicants can enlist at age 17 and participate in the Delayed Entry Program (DEP), in which the applicant is given the opportunity to participate in locally sponsored military activities, which can range from sports to competitions led by recruiters or other military liaisons (each recruiting station's DEP varies).", u'After enlistment, new recruits undergo basic training (also known as "boot camp" in the Marine Corps, Navy and Coast Guard), followed by schooling in their primary Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) or rating at any of the numerous training facilities around the world.', u'Each branch conducts basic training differently.', u"Marines send all non-infantry MOS's to an infantry skills course known as Marine Combat Training prior to their technical schools.", u'Air Force Basic Military Training graduates attend Technical Training and are awarded an Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) at the apprentice (3) skill level.', u'All Army recruits undergo Basic Combat Training (BCT), followed by Advanced Individual Training (AIT), with the exceptions of cavalry scouts, infantry, armor, combat engineers, and military police recruits who go to One Station Unit Training (OSUT), which combines BCT and AIT.', u'The Navy sends its recruits to Recruit Training and then to "A" schools to earn a rating.', u'The Coast Guard\'s recruits attend basic training and follow with an "A" school to earn a rating.', u'Initially, recruits without higher education or college degrees will hold the pay grade of E-1, and will be elevated to E-2 usually soon after basic training.', u'Different services have different incentive programs for enlistees, such as higher initial ranks for college credit, being an Eagle Scout, and referring friends who go on to enlist as well.', u'Participation in DEP is one way recruits can achieve rank before their departure to basic training.', u'There are several different authorized pay grade advancement requirements in each junior-enlisted rank category (E-1 to E-3), which differ by service.', u'Enlistees in the Army can attain the initial pay grade of E-4 (specialist) with a four-year degree, but the highest initial pay grade is usually E-3 (members of the Army Band program can expect to enter service at the grade of E-4).', u"Promotion through the junior enlisted ranks occurs after serving for a specified number of years (which, however, can be waived by the soldier's chain of command), a specified level of technical proficiency, or maintenance of good conduct.", u'Promotion can be denied with reason.', u'==== Non-commissioned officers ====\nWith very few exceptions, becoming a non-commissioned officer (NCO) in the U.S. military is accomplished by progression through the lower enlisted ranks.', u'However, unlike promotion through the lower enlisted tier, promotion to NCO is generally competitive.', u'NCO ranks begin at E-4 or E-5, depending upon service, and are generally attained between three and six years of service.', u'Junior NCOs function as first-line supervisors and squad leaders, training the junior enlisted in their duties and guiding their career advancement.', u'While considered part of the non-commissioned officer corps by law, senior non-commissioned officers (SNCOs) referred to as chief petty officers in the Navy and Coast Guard, or staff non-commissioned officers in the Marine Corps, perform duties more focused on leadership rather than technical expertise.', u'Promotion to the SNCO ranks, E-7 through E-9 (E-6 through E-9 in the Marine Corps) is highly competitive.', u"Personnel totals at the pay grades of E-8 and E-9 are limited by federal law to 2.5 percent and 1 percent of a service's enlisted force, respectively.", u'SNCOs act as leaders of small units and as staff.', u'Some SNCOs manage programs at headquarters level and a select few wield responsibility at the highest levels of the military structure.', u'Most unit commanders have a SNCO as an enlisted advisor.', u'All SNCOs are expected to mentor junior commissioned officers as well as the enlisted in their duty sections.', u'The typical enlistee can expect to attain SNCO rank after 10 to 16 years of service.', u'Each of the five services employs a single Senior Enlisted Advisor at departmental level.', u'This individual is the highest ranking enlisted member within that respective service and functions as the chief advisor to the service secretary, service chief of staff, and Congress on matters concerning the enlisted force.', u'These individuals carry responsibilities and protocol requirements equivalent to three-star general and flag officers.', u'They are as follows:\nSenior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman\nSergeant Major of the Army\nSergeant Major of the Marine Corps\nMaster Chief Petty Officer of the Navy\nChief Master Sergeant of the Air Force\nMaster Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard\n\n\n==== Warrant officers ====\nAdditionally, all services except for the Air Force have an active warrant-officer corps.', u'Above the rank of Warrant Officer One, these officers may also be commissioned, but usually serve in a more technical and specialized role within units.', u'More recently though they can also serve in more traditional leadership roles associated with the more recognizable officer corps.', u'With one notable exception (Army helicopter and fixed-wing pilots), these officers ordinarily have already been in the military often serving in senior NCO positions in the field in which they later serve as a Warrant Officer as a technical expert.', u'Most Army pilots have served some enlisted time.', u'It is also possible to enlist, complete basic training, go directly to the Warrant Officer Candidate school at Fort Rucker, Alabama, and then on to flight school.', u'Warrant officers in the U.S. military garner the same customs and courtesies as commissioned officers.', u"They may attend the officer's club, receive a command and are saluted by junior warrant officers and all enlisted service members.", u'The Air Force ceased to grant warrants in 1959 when the grades of E-8 and E-9 were created.', u'Most non-flying duties performed by warrant officers in other services are instead performed by senior NCOs in the Air Force.', u'==== Commissioned officers ====\nOfficers receive a commission in one of the branches of the U.S. military through one of the following routes.', u"Service academies (United States Military Academy in West Point, New York; United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland; United States Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, Colorado; the United States Coast Guard Academy at New London, Connecticut; and the United States Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, New York)\nReserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC)\nOfficer Candidate School (OCS) (Officer Training School (OTS) in the Air Force): This can be through active-duty academies, or through state-run academies in the case of the Army National Guard.", u'Direct commission: civilians who have special skills that are critical to sustaining military operations and supporting troops may receive direct commissions.', u'These officers occupy leadership positions in law, medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, nurse corps, intelligence, supply-logistics-transportation, engineering, public affairs, chaplain corps, oceanography, and others.', u'Battlefield commission: Under certain conditions, enlisted personnel who have skills that separate them from their peers can become officers by direct commissioning of a commander so authorized to grant them.', u'This type of commission is rarely granted and is reserved only for the most exceptional enlisted personnel; it is done on an ad hoc basis, typically only in wartime.', u'No direct battlefield commissions have been awarded since the Vietnam War.', u'The Navy and Air Force do not employ this commissioning path.', u'Limited Duty Officer: Due to the highly technical nature of some officer billets, the Marine Corps, Navy, and Coast Guard employ a system of promoting proven senior enlisted members to the ranks of commissioned officers.', u'They fill a need that is similar to, but distinct from that filled by Warrant Officers (to the point where their accession is through the same school).', u'While Warrant Officers remain technical experts, LDOs take on the role of a generalist, like that of officers commissioned through more traditional sources.', u'LDOs are limited, not by their authority, but by the types of billets they are allowed to fill.', u'However, in recent times, they have come to be used more and more like their more-traditional counterparts.', u"Officers receive a commission assigning them to the officer corps from the president with the Senate's consent.", u'To accept this commission, all officers must take an oath of office.', u'Through their careers, officers usually will receive further training at one or a number of the many staff colleges.', u'Company grade officers in pay grades O-1 through O-3 (known as "junior" officers in the Navy and Coast Guard) function as leaders of smaller units or sections of a unit, typically with an experienced SNCO (or CPO in the Navy and Coast Guard) assistant and mentor.', u'Field grade officers in pay grades O-4 through O-6 (known as "senior" officers in the Navy and Coast Guard) lead significantly larger and more complex operations, with gradually more competitive promotion requirements.', u'General officers, or flag officers in the Navy and Coast Guard, serve at the highest levels and oversee major portions of the military mission.', u'=== Five-star ranking ===\n\nThese are ranks of the highest honor and responsibility in the armed forces, but they are almost never given during peacetime and only a very small number of officers during wartime have held a five-star rank:\nGeneral of the Army\nFleet Admiral\nGeneral of the Air Force\nNo corresponding rank exists for the Marine Corps or the Coast Guard.', u'As with three- and four-star ranks, Congress is the approving authority

to refer to citizens of Russia is "Russians".', u'== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nNomadic pastoralism developed in the Pontic-Caspian steppe beginning in the Chalcolithic.', u'In classical antiquity, the Pontic Steppe was known as Scythia.', u'Beginning in the 8th century BC, Ancient Greek traders brought their civilization to the trade emporiums in Tanais and Phanagoria.', u'The Romans settled on the western part of the Caspian Sea, where their empire stretched towards the east.', u'In the 3rd to 4th centuries AD a semi-legendary Gothic kingdom of Oium existed in Southern Russia until it was overrun by Huns.', u'Between the 3rd and 6th centuries AD, the Bosporan Kingdom, a Hellenistic polity which succeeded the Greek colonies, was also overwhelmed by nomadic invasions led by warlike tribes, such as the Huns and Eurasian Avars.', u'A Turkic people, the Khazars, ruled the lower Volga basin steppes between the Caspian and Black Seas until the 10th century.', u'The ancestors of modern Russians are the Slavic tribes, whose original home is thought by some scholars to have been the wooded areas of the Pinsk Marshes.', u'The East Slavs gradually settled Western Russia in two waves: one moving from Kiev toward present-day Suzdal and Murom and another from Polotsk toward Novgorod and Rostov.', u'From the 7th century onwards, the East Slavs constituted the bulk of the population in Western Russia and assimilated the native Finno-Ugric peoples, including the Merya, the Muromians, and the Meshchera.', u"=== Kievan Rus' ===\n\nThe establishment of the first East Slavic states in the 9th century coincided with the arrival of Varangians, the traders, warriors and settlers from the Baltic Sea region.", u'Primarily they were Vikings of Scandinavian origin, who ventured along the waterways extending from the eastern Baltic to the Black and Caspian Seas.', u"According to the Primary Chronicle, a Varangian from Rus' people, named Rurik, was elected ruler of Novgorod in 862.", u"In 882 his successor Oleg ventured south and conquered Kiev, which had been previously paying tribute to the Khazars, founding Kievan Rus'.", u"Oleg, Rurik's son Igor and Igor's son Sviatoslav subsequently subdued all local East Slavic tribes to Kievan rule, destroyed the Khazar khaganate and launched several military expeditions to Byzantium and Persia.", u"In the 10th to 11th centuries Kievan Rus' became one of the largest and most prosperous states in Europe.", u'The reigns of Vladimir the Great (980\u20131015) and his son Yaroslav the Wise (1019\u20131054) constitute the Golden Age of Kiev, which saw the acceptance of Orthodox Christianity from Byzantium and the creation of the first East Slavic written legal code, the Russkaya Pravda.', u'In the 11th and 12th centuries, constant incursions by nomadic Turkic tribes, such as the Kipchaks and the Pechenegs, caused a massive migration of Slavic populations to the safer, heavily forested regions of the north, particularly to the area known as Zalesye.', u"The age of feudalism and decentralization was marked by constant in-fighting between members of the Rurik Dynasty that ruled Kievan Rus' collectively.", u"Kiev's dominance waned, to the benefit of Vladimir-Suzdal in the north-east, Novgorod Republic in the north-west and Galicia-Volhynia in the south-west.", u"Ultimately Kievan Rus' disintegrated, with the final blow being the Mongol invasion of 1237\u201340 that resulted in the destruction of Kiev and the death of about half the population of Rus'.", u'The invading Mongol elite, together with their conquered Turkic subjects (Cumans, Kipchaks, Bulgars), became known as Tatars, forming the state of the Golden Horde, which pillaged the Russian principalities; the Mongols ruled the Cuman-Kipchak confederation and Volga Bulgaria (modern-day southern and central expanses of Russia) for over two centuries.', u'Galicia-Volhynia was eventually assimilated by the Kingdom of Poland, while the Mongol-dominated Vladimir-Suzdal and Novgorod Republic, two regions on the periphery of Kiev, established the basis for the modern Russian nation.', u'The Novgorod together with Pskov retained some degree of autonomy during the time of the Mongol yoke and were largely spared the atrocities that affected the rest of the country.', u"Led by Prince Alexander Nevsky, Novgorodians repelled the invading Swedes in the Battle of the Neva in 1240, as well as the Germanic crusaders in the Battle of the Ice in 1242, breaking their attempts to colonize the Northern Rus'.", u'=== Grand Duchy of Moscow ===\n\nThe most powerful state to eventually arise after the destruction of Kievan Rus\' was the Grand Duchy of Moscow ("Muscovy" in the Western chronicles), initially a part of Vladimir-Suzdal.', u"While still under the domain of the Mongol-Tatars and with their connivance, Moscow began to assert its influence in the Central Rus' in the early 14th century, gradually becoming the leading force in the process of the Rus' lands' reunification and expansion of Russia.", u"Moscow's last rival, the Novgorod Republic, prospered as the chief fur trade center and the easternmost port of the Hanseatic League.", u'Times remained difficult, with frequent Mongol-Tatar raids.', u'Agriculture suffered from the beginning of the Little Ice Age.', u'As in the rest of Europe, plague was a frequent occurrence between 1350 and 1490.', u'However, because of the lower population density and better hygiene\u2014widespread practicing of banya, a wet steam bath\u2014the death rate from plague was not as severe as in Western Europe, and population numbers recovered by 1500.', u'Led by Prince Dmitry Donskoy of Moscow and helped by the Russian Orthodox Church, the united army of Russian principalities inflicted a milestone defeat on the Mongol-Tatars in the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380.', u'Moscow gradually absorbed the surrounding principalities, including formerly strong rivals such as Tver and Novgorod.', u'Ivan III ("the Great") finally threw off the control of the Golden Horde and consolidated the whole of Central and Northern Rus\' under Moscow\'s dominion.', u'He was also the first to take the title "Grand Duke of all the Russias".', u'After the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Moscow claimed succession to the legacy of the Eastern Roman Empire.', u"Ivan III married Sophia Palaiologina, the niece of the last Byzantine emperor Constantine XI, and made the Byzantine double-headed eagle his own, and eventually Russia's, coat-of-arms.", u'=== Tsardom of Russia ===\n\nIn development of the Third Rome ideas, the Grand Duke Ivan IV (the "Terrible") was officially crowned the first Tsar ("Caesar") of Russia in 1547.', u'The Tsar promulgated a new code of laws (Sudebnik of 1550), established the first Russian feudal representative body (Zemsky Sobor) and introduced local self-management into the rural regions.', u'During his long reign, Ivan the Terrible nearly doubled the already large Russian territory by annexing the three Tatar khanates (parts of the disintegrated Golden Horde): Kazan and Astrakhan along the Volga River, and the Siberian Khanate in southwestern Siberia.', u'Thus, by the end of the 16th century Russia was transformed into a multiethnic, multidenominational and transcontinental state.', u'However, the Tsardom was weakened by the long and unsuccessful Livonian War against the coalition of Poland, Lithuania, and Sweden for access to the Baltic coast and sea trade.', u'At the same time, the Tatars of the Crimean Khanate, the only remaining successor to the Golden Horde, continued to raid Southern Russia.', u'In an effort to restore the Volga khanates, Crimeans and their Ottoman allies invaded central Russia and were even able to burn down parts of Moscow in 1571.', u'But in the next year the large invading army was thoroughly defeated by Russians in the Battle of Molodi, forever eliminating the threat of an Ottoman\u2013Crimean expansion into Russia.', u'The slave raids of Crimeans, however, did not cease until the late 17th century though the construction of new fortification lines across Southern Russia, such as the Great Abatis Line, constantly narrowed the area accessible to incursions.', u"The death of Ivan's sons marked the end of the ancient Rurik Dynasty in 1598, and in combination with the famine of 1601\u201303 led to civil war, the rule of pretenders, and foreign intervention during the Time of Troubles in the early 17th century.", u'The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth occupied parts of Russia, including Moscow.', u'In 1612, the Poles were forced to retreat by the Russian volunteer corps, led by two national heroes, merchant Kuzma Minin and Prince Dmitry Pozharsky.', u'The Romanov Dynasty acceded to the throne in 1613 by the decision of Zemsky Sobor, and the country started its gradual recovery from the crisis.', u'Russia continued its territorial growth through the 17th century, which was the age of Cossacks.', u'Cossacks were warriors organized into military communities, resembling pirates and pioneers of the New World.', u'In 1648, the peasants of Ukraine joined the Zaporozhian Cossacks in rebellion against Poland-Lithuania during the Khmelnytsky Uprising in reaction to the social and religious oppression they had been suffering under Polish rule.', u"In 1654, the Ukrainian leader, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, offered to place Ukraine under the protection of the Russian Tsar, Aleksey I. Aleksey's acceptance of this offer led to another Russo-Polish War.", u'Finally, Ukraine was split along the Dnieper River, leaving the western part, right-bank Ukraine, under Polish rule and the eastern part (Left-bank Ukraine and Kiev) under Russian rule.', u"Later, in 1670\u201371, the Don Cossacks led by Stenka Razin initiated a major uprising in the Volga Region, but the Tsar's troops were successful in defeating the rebels.", u'In the east, the rapid Russian exploration and colonisation of the huge territories of Siberia was led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable furs and ivory.', u'Russian explorers pushed eastward primarily along the Siberian River Routes, and by the mid-17th century there were Russian settlements in Eastern Siberia, on the Chukchi Peninsula, along the Amur River, and on the Pacific coast.', u'In 1648, the Bering Strait between Asia and North America was passed for the first time by Fedot Popov and Semyon Dezhnyov.', u'=== Imperial Russia ===\n\nUnder Peter the Great, Russia was proclaimed an Empire in 1721 and became recognized as a world power.', u"Ruling from 1682 to 1725, Peter defeated Sweden in the Great Northern War, forcing it to cede West Karelia and Ingria (two regions lost by Russia in the Time of Troubles), as well as Estland and Livland, securing Russia's access to the sea and sea trade.", u'On the Baltic Sea Peter founded a new capital called Saint Petersburg, later known as Russia\'s "Window to Europe".', u"Peter the Great's reforms brought considerable Western European cultural influences to Russia.", u"The reign of Peter I's daughter Elizabeth in 1741\u201362 saw Russia's participation in the Seven Years' War (1756\u201363).", u'During this conflict Russia annexed East Prussia for a while and even took Berlin.', u"However, upon Elisabeth's death, all these conquests were returned to the Kingdom of Prussia by pro-Prussian Peter III of Russia.", u'Catherine II ("the Great"), who ruled in 1762\u201396, presided over the Age of Russian Enlightenment.', u'She extended Russian political control over the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and incorporated most of its territories into Russia during the Partitions of Poland, pushing the Russian frontier westward into Central Europe.', u"In the south, after successful Russo-Turkish Wars against Ottoman Turkey, Catherine advanced Russia's boundary to the Black Sea, defeating the Crimean Khanate.", u'As a result of victories over Qajar Iran through the Russo-Persian Wars, by the first half of the 19th century Russia also made significant territorial gains in Transcaucasia and the North Caucasus, forcing the former to irrevocably cede what is nowadays Georgia, Dagestan, Azerbaijan and Armenia to Russia.', u"This continued with Alexander I's (1801\u201325) wresting of Finland from the weakened kingdom of Sweden in 1809 and of Bessarabia from the Ottomans in 1812.", u'At the same time, Russians colonized Alaska and even founded settlements in California, such as Fort Ross.', u'In 1803\u20131806, the first Russian circumnavigation was made, later followed by other notable Russian sea exploration voyages.', u'In 1820, a Russian expedition discovered the continent of Antarctica.', u"In alliances with various European countries, Russia fought against Napoleon's France.", u"The French invasion of Russia at the height of Napoleon's power in 1812 failed miserably as the obstinate resistance in combination with the bitterly cold Russian winter led to a disastrous defeat of invaders, in which more than 95% of the pan-European Grande Arm\xe9e perished.", u'Led by Mikhail Kutuzov and Barclay de Tolly, the Russian army ousted Napoleon from the country and drove through Europe in the war of the Sixth Coalition, finally entering Paris.', u"Alexander I headed Russia's delegation at the Congress of Vienna that defined the map of post-Napoleonic Europe.", u"The officers of the Napoleonic Wars brought ideas of liberalism back to Russia with them and attempted to curtail the tsar's powers during the abortive Decembrist revolt of 1825.", u"At the end of the conservative reign of Nicolas I (1825\u201355), a zenith period of Russia's power and influence in Europe was disrupted by defeat in the Crimean War.", u'Between 1847 and 1851, about one million people died of Asiatic cholera.', u"Nicholas's successor Alexander II (1855\u201381) enacted significant changes in the country, including the emancipation reform of 1861.", u'These Great Reforms spurred industrialization and modernized the Russian army, which had successfully liberated Bulgaria from Ottoman rule in the 1877\u201378 Russo-Turkish War.', u'The late 19th century saw the rise of various socialist movements in Russia.', u'Alexander II was killed in 1881 by revolutionary terrorists, and the reign of his son Alexander III (1881\u201394) was less liberal but more peaceful.', u'The last Russian Emperor, Nicholas II (1894\u20131917), was unable to prevent the events of the Russian Revolution of 1905, triggered by the unsuccessful Russo-Japanese War and the demonstration incident known as Bloody Sunday.', u'The uprising was put down, but the government was forced to concede major reforms, including granting the freedoms of speech and assembly, the legalization of political parties, and the creation of an elected legislative body, the State Duma of the Russian Empire.', u'The Stolypin agrarian reform led to a massive peasant migration and settlement into Siberia.', u'More than four million settlers arrived in that region between 1906 and 1914.', u"In 1914, Russia entered World War I in response to Austria-Hungary's declaration of war on Russia's ally Serbia, and fought across multiple fronts while isolated from its Triple Entente allies.", u'In 1916, the Brusilov Offensive of the Russian Army almost completely destroyed the military of Austria-Hungary.', u'However, the already-existing public distrust of the regime was deepened by the rising costs of war, high casualties, and rumors of corruption and treason.', u'All this formed the climate for the Russian Revolution of 1917, carried out in two major acts.', u'=== Revolution and Russian Republic ===\n\nThe February Revolution forced Nicholas II to abdicate; he and his family were imprisoned and later executed in Yekaterinburg during the Russian Civil War.', u'The monarchy was replaced by a shaky coalition of political parties that declared itself the Provisional Government.', u'An alternative socialist establishment existed alongside, the Petrograd Soviet, wielding power through the democratically elected councils of workers and peasants, called Soviets.', u'The rule of the new authorities only aggravated the crisis in the country, instead of resolving it.', u"Eventually, the October Revolution, led by Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin, overthrew the Provisional Government and gave full governing power to the Soviets, leading to the creation of the world's first socialist state.", u'=== Soviet Russia and civil war ===\n\nFollowing the October Revolution, a civil war broke out between the anti-Communist White movement and the new Soviet regime with its Red Army.', u'Bolshevist Russia lost its Ukrainian, Polish, Baltic, and Finnish territories by signing the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk that concluded hostilities with the Central Powers of World War I.', u'The Allied powers launched an unsuccessful military intervention in support of anti-Communist forces.', u'In the meantime both the Bolsheviks and White movement carried out campaigns of deportations and executions against each other, known respectively as the Red Terror and White Terror.', u"By the end of the civil war, Russia's economy and infrastructure were heavily damaged.", u'Millions became White \xe9migr\xe9s, and the Povolzhye famine of 1921 claimed up to 5 million victims.', u'=== Soviet Union ===\n\nThe Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (called Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic at the time), together with the Ukrainian, Byelorussian, and Transcaucasian Soviet Socialist Republics, formed the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), or Soviet Union, on December 30, 1922.', u'Out of the 15 republics that would make up the USSR, the largest in size and over half of the total USSR population was the Russian SFSR, which came to dominate the union for its entire 69-year history.', u"Following Lenin's death in 1924, a troika was designated to govern the Soviet Union.", u'However, Joseph Stalin, an elected General Secretary of the Communist Party, managed to suppress all opposition groups within the party and consolidate power in his hands.', u"Leon Trotsky, the main proponent of world revolution, was exiled from the Soviet Union in 1929, and Stalin's idea of Socialism in One Country became the primary line.", u"The continued internal struggle in the Bolshevik party culminated in the Great Purge, a period of mass repressions in 1937\u201338, during which hundreds of thousands of people were executed, including original party members and military leaders accused of coup d'\xe9tat plots.", u"Under Stalin's leadership, the government launched a planned economy, industrialisation of the largely rural country, and collectivization of its agriculture.", u"During this period of rapid economic and social change, millions of people were sent to penal labor camps, including many political convicts for their opposition to Stalin's rule; millions were deported and exiled to remote areas of the Soviet Union.", u"The transitional disorganisation of the country's agriculture, combined with the harsh state policies and a drought, led to the Soviet famine of 1932\u20131933.", u'The Soviet Union, though with a heavy price, was transformed from a largely agrarian economy to a major industrial powerhouse in a short span of time.', u"The Appeasement policy of Great Britain and France towards Adolf Hitler's annexation of Austria and Czechoslovakia did not stem an increase in the power of Nazi Germany and initiated a threat of war to the Soviet Union.", u'Around the same time, the Third Reich allied with the Empire of Japan, a rival of the USSR in the Far East and an open enemy of the USSR in the Soviet\u2013Japanese Border Wars in 1938\u201339.', u'In August 1939, after another failure of attempts to establish an anti-Nazi alliance with Britain and France, the Soviet government decided to improve relations with Germany by concluding the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, pledging non-aggression between the two countries and dividing Eastern Europe into their respective spheres of influence.', u'While Hitler conquered Poland and France and other countries acted on a single front at the start of World War II, the USSR was able to build up its military and claim some of the former territories of the Russian Empire, Western Ukraine, Hertza region and Northern Bukovina as a result of the Soviet invasion of Poland, Winter War, occupation of the Baltic states and Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina.', u'On June 22, 1941, Nazi Germany broke the non-aggression treaty and invaded the Soviet Union with the largest and most powerful invasion force in human history, opening the largest theater of World War II.', u'Although the German army had considerable early success, their attack was halted in the Battle of Moscow.', u'Subsequently, the Germans were dealt major defeats first at the Battle of Stalingrad in the winter of 1942\u201343, and then in the Battle of Kursk in the summer of 1943.', u'Another German failure was the Siege of Leningrad, in which the city was fully blockaded on land between 1941 and 1944 by German and Finnish forces, and suffered starvation and more than a million deaths, but never surrendered.', u"Under Stalin's administration and the leadership of such commanders as Georgy Zhukov and Konstantin Rokossovsky, Soviet forces took Eastern Europe in 1944\u201345 and captured Berlin in May 1945.", u"In August 1945 the Soviet Army ousted the Japanese from China's Manchukuo and North Korea, contributing to the allied victory over Japan.", u'The 1941\u201345 period of World War II is known in Russia as the "Great Patriotic War".', u'The Soviet Union together with the United States, the United Kingdom and China were considered as the Big Four of Allied powers in World War II  and later became the Four Policemen which was the foundation of the United Nations Security Council.', u'During this war, which included many of the most lethal battle operations in human history, Soviet military and civilian deaths were 10.6 million and 15.9 million respectively, accounting for about a third of all World War II casualties.', u'The full demographic loss to the Soviet peoples was even greater.', u'The Soviet economy and infrastructure suffered massive devastation which caused the Soviet famine of 1946\u201347 but the Soviet Union emerged as an acknowledged military superpower on the continent.', u'After the war, Eastern and Central Europe including East Germany and part of Austria was occupied by Red Army according to the Potsdam Conference.', u'Dependent socialist governments were installed in the Eastern Bloc satellite states.', u"Becoming the world's second nuclear weapons power, the USSR established the Warsaw Pact alliance and entered into a struggle for global dominance, known as the Cold War, with the United States and NATO.", u"The Soviet Union supported revolutionary movements across the world, including the newly formed People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and, later on, the Republic of Cuba.", u'Significant amounts of Soviet resources were allocated in aid to the other socialist states.', u"After Stalin's death and a short period of collective rule, the new leader Nikita Khrushchev denounced the cult of personality of Stalin and launched the policy of de-Stalinization.", u'The penal labor system was reformed and many prisoners were released and rehabilitated (many of them posthumously).', u'The general easement of repressive policies became known later as the Khrushchev Thaw.', u'At the same time, tensions with the United States heightened when the two rivals clashed over the deployment of the United States Jupiter missiles in Turkey and Soviet missiles in Cuba.', u"In 1957, the Soviet Union launched the world's first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, thus starting the Space Age.", u"Russia's cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to orbit the Earth, aboard the Vostok 1 manned spacecraft on April 12, 1961.", u'Following the ousting of Khrushchev in 1964, another period of collective rule ensued, until Leonid Brezhnev became the leader.', u'The era of the 1970s and the early 1980s was designated later as the Era of Stagnation, a period when economic growth slowed and social policies became static.', u'The 1965 Kosygin reform aimed for partial decentralization of the Soviet economy and shifted the emphasis from heavy industry and weapons to light industry and consumer goods but was stifled by the conservative Communist leadership.', u'In 1979, after a Communist-led revolution in Afghanistan, Soviet forces entered that country at the request of the new regime.', u'The occupation drained economic resources and dragged on without achieving meaningful political results.', u'Ultimately, the Soviet Army was withdrawn from Afghanistan in 1989 due to international opposition, persistent anti-Soviet guerilla warfare, and a lack of support by Soviet citizens.', u'From 1985 onwards, the last Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who sought to enact liberal reforms in the Soviet system, introduced the policies of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) in an attempt to end the period of economic stagnation and to democratise the government.', u'This, however, led to the rise of strong nationalist and separatist movements.', u'Prior to 1991, the Soviet economy was the second largest in the world, but during its last years it was afflicted by shortages of goods in grocery stores, huge budget deficits, and explosive growth in the money supply leading to inflation.', u'By 1991, economic and political turmoil began to boil over, as the Baltic republics chose to secede from the Soviet Union.', u'On March 17, a referendum was held, in which the vast majority of participating citizens voted in favour of changing the Soviet Union into a renewed federation.', u"In August 1991, a coup d'\xe9tat attempt by members of Gorbachev's government, directed against Gorbachev and aimed at preserving the Soviet Union, instead led to the end of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.", u'On December 25, 1991, the USSR was dissolved into 15 post-Soviet states.', u'=== Russian Federation ===\n\nIn June 1991, Boris Yeltsin became the first directly elected President in Russian history when he was elected President of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, which became the independent Russian Federation in December of that year.', u'During and after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, wide-ranging reforms including privatization and market and trade liberalization were undertaken, including radical changes along the lines of "shock therapy" as recommended by the United States and the International Monetary Fund.', u'All this resulted in a major economic crisis, characterized by a 50% decline in both GDP and industrial output between 1990 and 1995.', u'The privatization largely shifted control of enterprises from state agencies to individuals with inside connections in the government.', u'Many of the newly rich moved billions in cash and assets outside of the country in an enormous capital flight.', u'The depression of the economy led to the collapse of social services; the birth rate plummeted while the death rate skyrocketed.', u'Millions plunged into poverty, from a level of 1.5% in the late Soviet era to 39\u201349% by mid-1993.', u'The 1990s saw extreme corruption and lawlessness, the rise of criminal gangs and violent crime.', u'The 1990s were plagued by armed conflicts in the North Caucasus, both local ethnic skirmishes and separatist Islamist insurrections.', u'From the time Chechen separatists declared independence in the early 1990s, an intermittent guerrilla war has been fought between the rebel groups and the Russian military.', u'Terrorist attacks against civilians carried out by separatists, most notably the Moscow theater hostage crisis and Beslan school siege, caused hundreds of deaths and drew worldwide attention.', u"Russia took up the responsibility for settling the USSR's external debts, even though its population made up just half of the population of the USSR at the time of its dissolution.", u'High budget deficits caused the 1998 Russian financial crisis and resulted in a further GDP decline.', u'On December 31, 1999, President Yeltsin unexpectedly resigned, handing the post to the recently appointed Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin, who then won the 2000 presidential election.', u'Putin suppressed the Chechen insurgency although sporadic violence still occurs throughout the Northern Caucasus.', u"High oil prices and the initially weak currency followed by increasing domestic demand, consumption, and investments has helped the economy grow for nine straight years, improving the standard of living and increasing Russia's influence on the world stage.", u"However, since the World economic crisis of 2008 and a subsequent drop in oil prices, Russia's economy has stagnated and poverty has again started to rise.", u"While many reforms made during the Putin presidency have been generally criticized by Western nations as undemocratic, Putin's leadership over the return of order, stability, and progress has won him widespread admiration in Russia.", u'On March 2, 2008, Dmitry Medvedev was elected President of Russia while Putin became Prime Minister.', u'Putin returned to the presidency following the 2012 presidential elections, and Medvedev was appointed Prime Minister.', u'In 2014, after President Viktor Yanukovych of Ukraine fled as a result of a revolution, Putin requested and received authorization from the Russian Parliament to deploy Russian troops to Ukraine.', u'Following a Crimean referendum in which separation was favored by a large majority of voters, but not accepted internationally, the Russian leadership announced the accession of Crimea into the Russian Federation.', u'On March 27 the United Nations General Assembly voted in favor of a non-binding resolution opposing the Russian annexation of Crimea by a vote of 100 in favour, 11 against and 58 abstentions.', u'In September 2015, Russia started military intervention in the Syrian Civil War, consisting of air strikes against militant groups of the Islamic State, al-Nusra Front (al-Qaeda in the Levant), and the Army of Conquest.', u'== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Governance ===\n\nAccording to the Constitution of Russia, the country is a federation and semi-presidential republic, wherein the President is the head of state and the Prime Minister is the head of government.', u'The Russian Federation is fundamentally structured as a multi-party representative democracy, with the federal government composed of three branches:\nLegislative: The bicameral Federal Assembly of Russia, made up of the 450-member State Duma and the 166-member Federation Council, adopts federal law, declares war, approves treaties, has the power of the purse and the power of impeachment of the President.', u'Executive: The President is the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, can veto legislative bills before they become law, and appoints the Government of Russia (Cabinet) and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies.', u'Judiciary: The Constitutional Court, Supreme Court and lower federal courts, whose judges are appointed by the Federation Council on the recommendation of the President, interpret laws and can overturn laws they deem unconstitutional.', u'The president is elected by popular vote for a six-year term (eligible for a second term, but not for a third consecutive term).', u'Ministries of the government are composed of the Premier and his deputies, ministers, and selected other individuals; all are appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Prime Minister (whereas the appointment of the latter requires the consent of the State Duma).', u'Leading political parties in Russia include United Russia, the Communist Party, the Liberal Democratic Party, and A Just Russia.', u'In 2013, Russia was ranked as 122nd of 167 countries in the Democracy Index, compiled by The Economist Intelligence Unit, while the World Justice Project currently ranks Russia 80th of 99 countries surveyed in terms of rule of law.', u'=== Foreign relations ===\n\nThe Russian Federation is recognized in international law as a successor state of the former Soviet Union.', u"Russia continues to implement the international commitments of the USSR, and has assumed the USSR's permanent seat in the UN Security Council, membership in other international organisations, the rights and obligations under international treaties, and property and debts.", u'Russia has a multifaceted foreign policy.', u'As of 2009, it maintains diplomatic relations with 191 countries and has 144 embassies.', u'The foreign policy is determined by the President and implemented by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia.', u"As the successor to a former superpower, Russia's geopolitical status has often been debated, particularly in relation to unipolar and multipolar views on the global political system.", u'While Russia is commonly accepted to be a great power, in recent years it has been characterized by a number of world leaders, scholars, commentators and politicians as a currently reinstating or potential superpower.', u'As one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council, Russia plays a major role in maintaining international peace and security.', u'The country participates in the Quartet on the Middle East and the Six-party talks with North Korea.', u'Russia is a member of the G8 industrialized nations, the Council of Europe, OSCE, and APEC.', u'Russia usually takes a leading role in regional organisations such as the CIS, EurAsEC, CSTO, and the SCO.', u'Russia became the 39th member state of the Council of Europe in 1996.', u'In 1998, Russia ratified the European Convention on Human Rights.', u'The legal basis for EU relations with Russia is the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which came into force in 1997.', u"The Agreement recalls the parties' shared respect for democracy and human rights, political and economic freedom and commitment to international peace and security.", u'In May 2003, the EU and Russia agreed to reinforce their cooperation on the basis of common values and shared interests.', u'Former President Vladimir Putin had advocated a strategic partnership with close integration in various dimensions including establishment of EU-Russia Common Spaces.', u'Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia has developed a friendlier relationship with the United States and NATO.', u'The NATO-Russia Council was established in 2002 to allow the United States, Russia and the 27 allies in NATO to work together as equal partners to pursue opportunities for joint collaboration.', u'Russia maintains strong and positive relations with other BRIC countries.', u'India is the largest customer of Russian military equipment and the two countries share extensive defense and strategic relations.', u"In recent years, the country has strengthened bilateral ties especially with the People's Republic of China by signing the Treaty of Friendship as well as building the Trans-Siberian oil pipeline and gas pipeline from Siberia to China.", u"An important aspect of Russia's relations with the West is the criticism of Russia's political system and human rights management (including LGBT rights, media freedom, and reports about killed journalists) by Western governments, the mass media and the leading democracy and human rights watchdogs.", u'In particular, such organisations as the Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch consider Russia to have not enough democratic attributes and to allow few political rights and civil liberties to its citizens.', u'Freedom House, an international organisation funded by the United States, ranks Russia as "not free", citing "carefully engineered elections" and "absence" of debate.', u'Russian authorities dismiss these claims and especially criticise Freedom House.', u'The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called the 2006 Freedom in the World report "prefabricated", stating that the human rights issues have been turned into a political weapon in particular by the United States.', u'The ministry also claims that such organisations as Freedom House and Human Rights Watch use the same scheme of voluntary extrapolation of "isolated facts that of course can be found in any country" into dominant tendencies.', u'=== Military ===\n\nThe Russian military is divided into the Ground Forces, Navy, and Air Force.', u'There are also three independent arms of service: Strategic Missile Troops, Aerospace Defence Forces, and the Airborne Troops.', u'In 2006, the military had 1.037 million personnel on active duty.', u'It is mandatory for all male citizens aged 18\u201327 to be drafted for a year of service in Armed Forces.', u'Russia has the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world.', u'It has the second largest fleet of ballistic missile submarines and is the only country apart from the United States with a modern strategic bomber force.', u"Russia's tank force is the largest in the world, its surface navy and air force are among the largest ones.", u'The country has a large and fully indigenous arms industry, producing most of its own military equipment with only few types of weapons imported.', u"Russia is one of the world's top supplier of arms, a spot it has held since 2001, accounting for around 30% of worldwide weapons sales and exporting weapons to about 80 countries.", u'The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, SIPRI, found that Russia was the second biggest exporter of arms in 2010-14, increasing their exports by 37 per cent from the period 2005-2009.', u'In 2010-14, Russia delivered weapons to 56 states and to rebel forces in eastern Ukraine.', u"The Russian government's published 2014 military budget is about 2.49 trillion rubles (approximately US$69.3 billion), the third largest in the world behind the US and China.", u'The official budget is set to rise to 3.03 trillion rubles (approximately US$83.7 billion) in 2015, and 3.36 trillion rubles (approximately US$93.9 billion) in 2016.', u"However, unofficial estimates put the budget significantly higher, for example the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) 2013 Military Expenditure Database estimated Russia's military expenditure in 2012 at US$90.749 billion.", u"This estimate is an increase of more than US$18 billion on SIPRI's estimate of the Russian military budget for 2011 (US$71.9 billion).", u"As of 2014, Russia's military budget is higher than any other European nation.", u'According to 2012 Global Peace Index, Russia is the sixth least peaceful out of 162 countries in the world, principally because of its defense industry.', u'Russia has historically ranked low on the index since its inception in 2007.', u'=== Political divisions ===\n\nFederal subjects\nAccording to the Constitution, the country comprises eighty-five federal subjects, including the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol, whose recent establishment is internationally disputed and criticized as illegal annexation.', u'In 1993, when the Constitution was adopted, there were eighty-nine federal subjects listed, but later some of them were merged.', u'These subjects have equal representation\u2014two delegates each\u2014in the Federation Council.', u'However, they differ in the degree of autonomy they enjoy.', u'46 oblasts (provinces): most common type of federal subjects, with locally elected governor and legislature.', u'22 republics: nominally autonomous; each is tasked with drafting its own constitution, direct-elected head of republic or a similar post, and parliament.', u'Republics are allowed to establish their own official language alongside Russian but are represented by the federal government in international affairs.', u'Republics are meant to be home to specific ethnic minorities.', u'9 krais (territories): essentially the same as oblasts.', u'The "territory" designation is historic, originally given to frontier regions and later also to the administrative divisions that comprised autonomous okrugs or autonomous oblasts.', u'4 autonomous okrugs (autonomous districts): originally autonomous entities within oblasts and krais created for ethnic minorities, their status was elevated to that of federal subjects in the 1990s.', u'With the exception of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, all autonomous okrugs are still administratively subordinated to a krai or an oblast of which they are a part.', u'1 autonomous oblast (the Jewish Autonomous Oblast): historically, autonomous oblasts were administrative units subordinated to krais.', u'In 1990, all of them except for the Jewish AO were elevated in status to that of a republic.', u'3 federal cities (Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and Sevastopol): major cities that function as separate regions.', u'Federal districts\nFederal subjects are grouped into eight federal districts, each administered by an envoy appointed by the President of Russia.', u'Unlike the federal subjects, the federal districts are not a subnational level of government, but are a level of administration of the federal government.', u"Federal districts' envoys serve as liaisons between the federal subjects and the federal government and are primarily responsible for overseeing the compliance of the federal subjects with the federal laws.", u'== Geography ==\n\nRussia is the largest country in the world; its total area is 17,075,200 square kilometres (6,592,800 sq mi).', u'There are 23 UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Russia, 40 UNESCO biosphere reserves, 41 national parks and 101 nature reserves.', u"It lies between latitudes 41\xb0 and 82\xb0 N, and longitudes 19\xb0 E and 169\xb0 W.\nRussia's territorial expansion was achieved largely in the late 16th century under the Cossack Yermak Timofeyevich during the reign of Ivan the Terrible, at a time when competing city-states in the western regions of Russia had banded together to form one country.", u'Yermak mustered an army and pushed eastward where he conquered nearly all the lands once belonging to the Mongols, defeating their ruler, Khan Kuchum.', u'Russia has a wide natural resource base, including major deposits of timber, petroleum, natural gas, coal, ores and other mineral resources.', u'=== Topography ===\nThe two most widely separated points in Russia are about 8,000 km (4,971 mi) apart along a geodesic line.', u'These points are: a 60 km (37 mi) long Vistula Spit the boundary with Poland separating the Gda\u0144sk Bay from the Vistula Lagoon and the most southeastern point of the Kuril Islands.', u'The points which are farthest separated in longitude are 6,600 km (4,101 mi) apart along a geodesic line.', u'These points are: in the west, the same spit on the boundary with Poland, and in the east, the Big Diomede Island.', u'The Russian Federation spans nine time zones.', u'Most of Russia consists of vast stretches of plains that are predominantly steppe to the south and heavily forested to the north, with tundra along the northern coast.', u"Russia possesses 10% of the world's arable land.", u'Mountain ranges are found along the southern borders, such as the Caucasus (containing Mount Elbrus, which at 5,642 m (18,510 ft) is the highest point in both Russia and Europe) and the Altai (containing Mount Belukha, which at the 4,506 m (14,783 ft) is the highest point of Siberia outside of the Russian Far East); and in the eastern parts, such as the Verkhoyansk Range or the volcanoes of Kamchatka Peninsula (containing Klyuchevskaya Sopka, which at the 4,750 m (15,584 ft) is the highest active volcano in Eurasia as well as the highest point of Asian Russia).', u'The Ural Mountains, rich in mineral resources, form a north-south range that divides Europe and Asia.', u'Russia has an extensive coastline of over 37,000 km (22,991 mi) along the Arctic and Pacific Oceans, as well as along the Baltic Sea, Sea of Azov, Black Sea and Caspian Sea.', u'The Barents Sea, White Sea, Kara Sea, Laptev Sea, East Siberian Sea, Chukchi Sea, Bering Sea, Sea of Okhotsk, and the Sea of Japan are linked to Russia via the Arctic and Pacific.', u"Russia's major islands and archipelagos include Novaya Zemlya, the Franz Josef Land, the Severnaya Zemlya, the New Siberian Islands, Wrangel Island, the Kuril Islands, and Sakhalin.", u'The Diomede Islands (one controlled by Russia, the other by the United States) are just 3 km (1.9 mi) apart, and Kunashir Island is about 20 km (12.4 mi) from Hokkaido, Japan.', u"Russia has thousands of rivers and inland bodies of water, providing it with one of the world's largest surface water resources.", u"Its lakes contain approximately one-quarter of the world's liquid fresh water.", u"The largest and most prominent of Russia's bodies of fresh water is Lake Baikal, the world's deepest, purest, oldest and most capacious fresh water lake.", u"Baikal alone contains over one-fifth of the world's fresh surface water.", u'Other major lakes include Ladoga and Onega, two of the largest lakes in Europe.', u'Russia is second only to Brazil in volume of the total renewable water resources.', u"Of the country's 100,000 rivers, the Volga is the most famous, not only because it is the longest river in Europe, but also because of its major role in Russian history.", u'The Siberian rivers Ob, Yenisey, Lena and Amur are among the longest rivers in the world.', u'=== Climate ===\n\nThe enormous size of Russia and the remoteness of many areas from the sea result in the dominance of the humid continental climate, which is prevalent in all parts of the country except for the tundra and the extreme southeast.', u'Mountains in the south obstruct the flow of warm air masses from the Indian Ocean, while the plain of the west and north makes the country open to Arctic and Atlantic influences.', u'Most of Northern European Russia and Siberia has a subarctic climate, with extremely severe winters in the inner regions of Northeast Siberia (mostly the Sakha Republic, where the Northern Pole of Cold is located with the record low temperature of \u221271.2 \xb0C or \u221296.2 \xb0F), and more moderate winters elsewhere.', u'Both the strip of land along the shore of the Arctic Ocean and the Russian Arctic islands have a polar climate.', u'The coastal part of Krasnodar Krai on the Black Sea, most notably in Sochi, possesses a humid subtropical climate with mild and wet winters.', u'In many regions of East Siberia and the Far East, winter is dry compared to summer; other parts of the country experience more even precipitation across seasons.', u'Winter precipitation in most parts of the country usually falls as snow.', u'The region along the Lower Volga and Caspian Sea coast, as well as some areas of southernmost Siberia, possesses a semi-arid climate.', u'Throughout much of the territory there are only two distinct seasons\u2014winter and summer\u2014as spring and autumn are usually brief periods of change between extremely low and extremely high temperatures.', u'The coldest month is January (February on the coastline); the warmest is usually July.', u'Great ranges of temperature are typical.', u'In winter, temperatures get colder both from south to north and from west to east.', u'Summers can be quite hot, even in Siberia.', u'The continental interiors are the driest areas.', u'=== Biodiversity ===\n\nFrom north to south the East European Plain, also known as Russian Plain, is clad sequentially in Arctic tundra, coniferous forest (taiga), mixed and broad-leaf forests, grassland (steppe), and semi-desert (fringing the Caspian Sea), as the changes in vegetation reflect the changes in climate.', u'Siberia supports a similar sequence but is largely taiga.', u'Russia has the world\'s largest forest reserves, known as "the lungs of Europe", second only to the Amazon Rainforest in the amount of carbon dioxide it absorbs.', u'There are 266 mammal species and 780 bird species in Russia.', u'A total of 415 animal species have been included in the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation as of 1997 and are now protected.', u'== Economy ==\n\nRussia has a developed, high-income market economy with enormous natural resources, particularly oil and natural gas.', u'It has the 15th largest economy in the world by nominal GDP and the 6th largest by purchasing power parity (PPP).', u'Since the turn of the 21st century, higher domestic consumption and greater political stability have bolstered economic growth in Russia.', u'The country ended 2008 with its ninth straight year of growth, but growth has slowed with the decline in the price of oil and gas.', u'Real GDP per capita, PPP (current international) was 19,840 in 2010.', u'Growth was primarily driven by non-traded services and goods for the domestic market, as opposed to oil or mineral extraction and exports.', u'The average nominal salary in Russia was $967 per month in early 2013, up from $80 in 2000.', u'In March 2014 the average nominal monthly wages reached 30,000 RUR (or US$980), while tax on the income of individuals is payable at the rate of 13% on most incomes.', u'Approximately 12.8% of Russians lived below the national poverty line in 2011, significantly down from 40% in 1998 at the worst point of the post-Soviet collapse.', u'Unemployment in Russia was 5.4% in 2014, down from about 12.4% in 1999.', u'The middle class has grown from just 8 million persons in 2000 to 104 million persons in 2013.', u'However, after United States-led sanctions since 2014 and a collapse in oil prices, the proportion of middle-class could halve to 20%.', u'Sugar imports reportedly dropped 82% between 2012 and 2013 as a result of the increase in domestic output.', u'Oil, natural gas, metals, and timber account for more than 80% of Russian exports abroad.', u'Since 2003, the exports of natural resources started decreasing in economic importance as the internal market strengthened considerably.', u"Despite higher energy prices, oil and gas only contribute to 5.7% of Russia's GDP and the government predicts this will be 3.7% by 2011.", u'Oil export earnings allowed Russia to increase its foreign reserves from $12 billion in 1999 to $597.3 billion on August 1, 2008, the third largest foreign exchange reserves in the world.', u'The macroeconomic policy under Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin was prudent and sound, with excess income being stored in the Stabilization Fund of Russia.', u'In 2006, Russia repaid most of its formerly massive debts, leaving it with one of the lowest foreign debts among major economies.', u'The Stabilization Fund helped Russia to come out of the global financial crisis in a much better state than many experts had expected.', u'A simpler, more streamlined tax code adopted in 2001 reduced the tax burden on people and dramatically increased state revenue.', u'Russia has a flat tax rate of 13%.', u'This ranks it as the country with the second most attractive personal tax system for single managers in the world after the United Arab Emirates.', u'According to Bloomberg, Russia is considered well ahead of most other resource-rich countries in its economic development, with a long tradition of education, science, and industry.', u'The country has a higher proportion of higher education graduates than any other country in Eurasia.', u"The economic development of the country has been uneven geographically with the Moscow region contributing a very large share of the country's GDP.", u'Inequality of household income and wealth has also been noted, with Credit Suisse finding Russian wealth distribution so much more extreme than other countries studied it "deserves to be placed in a separate category."', u'Another problem is modernisation of infrastructure, ageing and inadequate after years of being neglected in the 1990s; the government has said $1 trillion will be invested in development of infrastructure by 2020.', u'In December 2011, Russia finally joined the World Trade Organisation, allowing it a greater access to overseas markets.', u'Some analysts estimate that WTO membership could bring the Russian economy a bounce of up to 3% annually.', u'Russia ranks as the second-most corrupt country in Europe (after Ukraine), according to the Corruption Perceptions Index.', u'The Norwegian-Russian Chamber of Commerce also states that "[c]orruption is one of the biggest problems both Russian and international companies have to deal with".', u'The high rate of corruption acts as a hidden tax as businesses and individuals often have to pay money that is not part of the official tax rate.', u'It is estimated that corruption is costing the Russian economy an estimated $2 billion (80 billion rubles) per year.', u"In 2014, a book-length study by Professor Karen Dawisha was published concerning corruption in Russian under Putin's government.", u'The Russian central bank announced plans in 2013 to free float the Russian ruble in 2015.', u'According to a stress test conducted by the central bank Russian financial system would be able to handle a currency decline of 25%\u201330% without major central bank interference.', u'However, Russian economy began stagnating in late 2013 and in combination with the War in Donbass is in danger of entering stagflation, slow growth and high inflation.', u'The Russian ruble collapsed by 24% from October 2013 to October 2014 entering the level where the central bank may need to intervene to strengthen the currency.', u'Moreover, after bringing inflation down to 3.6% in 2012, the lowest rate since gaining independence from the Soviet Union, inflation in Russia jumped to nearly 7.5% in 2014, causing the central bank to increase its lending rate to 8% from 5.5% in 2013.', u'In an October 2014 article in Bloomberg Business Week, it was reported that Russia had significantly started shifting its economy towards China in response to increasing financial tensions following its annexation of Crimea and subsequent Western economic sanctions.', u"=== Agriculture ===\n\nRussia's total area of cultivated land is estimated at 1,237,294 square kilometres (477,722 sq mi), the fourth largest in the world.", u"From 1999 to 2009, Russia's agriculture grew steadily, and the country turned from a grain importer to the third largest grain exporter after the EU and the United States.", u'The production of meat has grown from 6,813,000 tonnes in 1999 to 9,331,000 tonnes in 2008, and continues to grow.', u'This restoration of agriculture was supported by a credit policy of the government, helping both individual farmers and large privatized corporate farms that once were Soviet kolkhozes and which still own the significant share of agricultural land.', u"While large farms concentrate mainly on grain production and husbandry products, small private household plots produce most of the country's potatoes, vegetables and fruits.", u'Since Russia borders three oceans (the Atlantic, Arctic, and Pacific), Russian fishing fleets are a major world fish supplier.', u'Russia captured 3,191,068 tons of fish in 2005.', u'Both exports and imports of fish and sea products grew significantly in recent years, reaching $2,415 and $2,036 million, respectively, in 2008.', u"Sprawling from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean, Russia has more than a fifth of the world's forests, which makes it the largest forest country in the world.", u"However, according to a 2012 study by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the Government of the Russian Federation, the considerable potential of Russian forests is underutilized and Russia's share of the global trade in forest products is less than four percent.", u'=== Energy ===\n\nIn recent years, Russia has frequently been described in the media as an energy superpower.', u"The country has the world's largest natural gas reserves, the 8th largest oil reserves, and the second largest coal reserves.", u"Russia is the world's leading natural gas exporter and second largest natural gas producer, while also the largest oil exporter and the largest oil producer.", u'Russia is the 3rd largest electricity producer in the world and the 5th largest renewable energy producer, the latter because of the well-developed hydroelectricity production in the country.', u'Large cascades of hydropower plants are built in European Russia along big rivers like the Volga.', u'The Asian part of Russia also features a number of major hydropower stations, however the gigantic hydroelectric potential of Siberia and the Russian Far East largely remains unexploited.', u"Russia was the first country to develop civilian nuclear power and to construct the world's first nuclear power plant.", u'Currently the country is the 4th largest nuclear energy producer, with all nuclear power in Russia being managed by Rosatom State Corporation.', u'The sector is rapidly developing, with an aim of increasing the total share of nuclear energy from current 16.9% to 23% by 2020.', u'The Russian government plans to allocate 127 billion rubles ($5.42 billion) to a federal program dedicated to the next generation of nuclear energy technology.', u'About 1 trillion rubles ($42.7 billion) is to be allocated from the federal budget to nuclear power and industry development before 2015.', u'In May 2014 on a two-day trip to Shanghai, President Putin signed a deal on behalf of Gazprom for the Russian energy giant to supply China with 38 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year.', u'Construction of a pipeline to facilitate the deal was agreed whereby Russia would contribute $55bn to the cost, and China $22bn, in what Putin described as "the world\'s biggest construction project for the next four years."', u'The natural gas would begin to flow sometime between 2018 and 2020 and would continue for 30 years at an ultimate cost to China of $400bn.', u'=== Transport ===\n\nRailway transport in Russia is mostly under the control of the state-run Russian Railways monopoly.', u"The company accounts for over 3.6% of Russia's GDP and handles 39% of the total freight traffic (including pipelines) and more than 42% of passenger traffic.", u'The total length of common-used railway tracks exceeds 85,500 km (53,127 mi), second only to the United States.', u'Over 44,000 km (27,340 mi) of tracks are electrified, which is the largest number in the world, and additionally there are more than 30,000 km (18,641 mi) of industrial non-common carrier lines.', u'Railways in Russia, unlike in the most of the world, use broad gauge of 1,520 mm (4 ft 11 27\u204432 in), with the exception of 957 km (595 mi) on Sakhalin island using narrow gauge of 1,067 mm (3 ft 6 in).', u'The most renowned railway in Russia is Trans-Siberian (Transsib), spanning a record 7 time zones and serving the longest single continuous services in the world, Moscow-Vladivostok (9,259 km (5,753 mi)), Moscow\u2013Pyongyang (10,267 km (6,380 mi)) and Kiev\u2013Vladivostok (11,085 km (6,888 mi)).', u'As of 2006 Russia had 933,000 km of roads, of which 755,000 were paved.', u'Some of these make up the Russian federal motorway system.', u'With a large land area the road density is the lowest of all the G8 and BRIC countries.', u"Much of Russia's inland waterways, which total 102,000 km (63,380 mi), are made up of natural rivers or lakes.", u'In the European part of the country the network of channels connects the basins of major rivers.', u'Russia\'s capital, Moscow, is sometimes called "the port of the five seas", because of its waterway connections to the Baltic, White, Caspian, Azov and Black Seas.', u'Major sea ports of Russia include Rostov-on-Don on the Azov Sea, Novorossiysk on the Black Sea, Astrakhan and Makhachkala on the Caspian, Kaliningrad and St Petersburg on the Baltic, Arkhangelsk on the White Sea, Murmansk on the Barents Sea, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky and Vladivostok on the Pacific Ocean.', u'In 2008 the country owned 1,448 merchant marine ships.', u"The world's only fleet of nuclear-powered icebreakers advances the economic exploitation of the Arctic continental shelf of Russia and the development of sea trade through the Northern Sea Route between Europe and East Asia.", u'By total length of pipelines Russia is second only to the United States.', u'Currently many new pipeline projects are being realized, including Nord Stream and South Stream natural gas pipelines to Europe, and the Eastern Siberia \u2013 Pacific Ocean oil pipeline (ESPO) to the Russian Far East and China.', u'Russia has 1,216 airports, the busiest being Sheremetyevo, Domodedovo, and Vnukovo in Moscow, and Pulkovo in St. Petersburg.', u'Typically, major Russian cities have well-developed systems of public transport, with the most common varieties of exploited vehicles being bus, trolleybus and tram.', u'Seven Russian cities, namely Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod, Novosibirsk, Samara, Yekaterinburg, and Kazan, have underground metros, while Volgograd features a metrotram.', u'The total length of metros in Russia is 465.4 kilometres (289.2 mi).', u'Moscow Metro and Saint Petersburg Metro are the oldest in Russia, opened in 1935 and 1955 respectively.', u'These two are among the fastest and busiest metro systems in the world, and are famous for rich decorations and unique designs of their stations, which is a common tradition in Russian metros and railways.', u'=== Science and technology ===\n\nScience and technology in Russia blossomed since the Age of Enlightenment, when Peter the Great founded the Russian Academy of Sciences and Saint Petersburg State University, and polymath Mikhail Lomonosov established the Moscow State University, paving the way for a strong native tradition in learning and innovation.', u'In the 19th and 20th centuries the country produced a large number of notable scientists and inventors.', u'The Russian physics school began with Lomonosov who proposed the law of conservation of matter preceding the energy conservation law.', u"Russian discoveries and inventions in physics include the electric arc, electrodynamical Lenz's law, space groups of crystals, photoelectric cell, superfluidity, Cherenkov radiation, electron paramagnetic resonance, heterotransistors and 3D holography.", u'Lasers and masers were co-invented by Nikolai Basov and Alexander Prokhorov, while the idea of tokamak for controlled nuclear fusion was introduced by Igor Tamm, Andrei Sakharov and Lev Artsimovich, leading eventually the modern international ITER project, where Russia is a party.', u'Since the time of Nikolay Lobachevsky (the "Copernicus of Geometry" who pioneered the non-Euclidean geometry) and a prominent tutor Pafnuty Chebyshev, the Russian mathematical school became one of the most influential in the world.', u"Chebyshev's students included Aleksandr Lyapunov, who founded the modern stability theory, and Andrey Markov who invented the Markov chains.", u'In the 20th century Soviet mathematicians, such as Andrey Kolmogorov, Israel Gelfand, and Sergey Sobolev, made major contributions to various areas of mathematics.', u'Nine Soviet/Russian mathematicians were awarded with Fields Medal, a most prestigious award in mathematics.', u'Recently Grigori Perelman was offered the first ever Clay Millennium Prize Problems Award for his final proof of the Poincar\xe9 conjecture in 2002.', u'Russian chemist Dmitry Mendeleev invented the Periodic table, the main framework of modern chemistry.', u'Aleksandr Butlerov was one of the creators of the theory of chemical structure, playing a central role in organic chemistry.', u'Russian biologists include Dmitry Ivanovsky who discovered viruses, Ivan Pavlov who was the first to experiment with the classical conditioning, and Ilya Mechnikov who was a pioneer researcher of the immune system and probiotics.', u'Many Russian scientists and inventors were \xe9migr\xe9s, like Igor Sikorsky, who built the first airliners and modern-type helicopters; Vladimir Zworykin, often called the father of TV; chemist Ilya Prigogine, noted for his work on dissipative structures and complex systems; Nobel Prize-winning economists Simon Kuznets and Wassily Leontief; physicist Georgiy Gamov (an author of the Big Bang theory) and social scientist Pitirim Sorokin.', u'Many foreigners worked in Russia for a long time, like Leonard Euler and Alfred Nobel.', u'Russian inventions include arc welding by Nikolay Benardos, further developed by Nikolay Slavyanov, Konstantin Khrenov and other Russian engineers.', u'Gleb Kotelnikov invented the knapsack parachute, while Evgeniy Chertovsky introduced the pressure suit.', u'Alexander Lodygin and Pavel Yablochkov were pioneers of electric lighting, and Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky introduced the first three-phase electric power systems, widely used today.', u'Sergei Lebedev invented the first commercially viable and mass-produced type of synthetic rubber.', u'The first ternary computer, Setun, was developed by Nikolay Brusentsov.', u'In the 20th century a number of prominent Soviet aerospace engineers, inspired by the fundamental works of Nikolai Zhukovsky, Sergei Chaplygin and others, designed many hundreds of models of military and civilian aircraft and founded a number of KBs (Construction Bureaus) that now constitute the bulk of Russian United Aircraft Corporation.', u'Famous Russian aircraft include the civilian Tu-series, Su and MiG fighter aircraft, Ka and Mi-series helicopters; many Russian aircraft models are on the list of most produced aircraft in history.', u'Famous Russian battle tanks include T34, the most heavily produced tank design of World War II, and further tanks of T-series, including the most produced tank in history, T54/55.', u'The AK47 and AK74 by Mikhail Kalashnikov constitute the most widely used type of assault rifle throughout the world\u2014so much so that more AK-type rifles have been manufactured than all other assault rifles combined.', u'With all these achievements, however, since the late Soviet era Russia was lagging behind the West in a number of technologies, mostly those related to energy conservation and consumer goods production.', u'The crisis of the 1990s led to the drastic reduction of the state support for science and a brain drain migration from Russia.', u'In the 2000s, on the wave of a new economic boom, the situation in the Russian science and technology has improved, and the government launched a campaign aimed into modernisation and innovation.', u"Russian President Dmitry Medvedev formulated top priorities for the country's technological development:\nEfficient energy use\nInformation technology, including both common products and the products combined with space technology\nNuclear energy\nPharmaceuticals\nCurrently Russia has completed the GLONASS satellite navigation system.", u'The country is developing its own fifth-generation jet fighter and constructing the first serial mobile nuclear plant in the world.', u'=== Space exploration ===\n\nRussian achievements in the field of space technology and space exploration are traced back to Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, the father of theoretical astronautics.', u'His works had inspired leading Soviet rocket engineers, such as Sergey Korolyov, Valentin Glushko, and many others who contributed to the success of the Soviet space program on early stages of the Space Race and beyond.', u'In 1957 the first Earth-orbiting artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, was launched; in 1961 the first human trip into space was successfully made by Yury Gagarin.', u'Many other Soviet and Russian space exploration records ensued, including the first spacewalk performed by Alexey Leonov, Luna 9 was the first spacecraft to land on the Moon, Venera 7 was the first to land on another planet (Venus), Mars 3 then the first to land on Mars, the first space exploration rover Lunokhod 1 and the first space station Salyut 1 and Mir.', u'After the collapse of the Soviet Union, some government-funded space exploration programs, including the Buran space shuttle program, were cancelled or delayed, while participation of the Russian space industry in commercial activities and international cooperation intensified.', u'Nowadays Russia is the largest satellite launcher.', u'After the United States Space Shuttle program ended in 2011, Soyuz rockets became the only provider of transport for astronauts at the International Space Station.', u'=== Water supply and sanitation ===\n\nIn Russia, approximately 70 per cent of drinking water comes from surface water and 30 per cent from groundwater.', u'In 2004, water supply systems had a total capacity of 90 million cubic metres a day.', u'The average residential water use was 248 litres per capita per day.', u"One fourth of the world's fresh surface and groundwater is located in Russia.", u'The water utilities sector is one of the largest industries in Russia serving the entire Russian population.', u"== Demographics ==\n\nEthnic Russians comprise 81% of the country's population.", u'The Russian Federation is also home to several sizeable minorities.', u'In all, 160 different other ethnic groups and indigenous peoples live within its borders.', u"Though Russia's population is comparatively large, its density is low because of the country's enormous size.", u'Population is densest in European Russia, near the Ural Mountains, and in southwest Siberia.', u'73% of the population lives in urban areas while 27% in rural ones.', u'The results of the 2010 Census show a total population of 142,856,536.', u"Russia's population peaked at 148,689,000 in 1991, just before the dissolution of the Soviet Union.", u'It began to experience a rapid decline starting in the mid-1990s.', u'The decline has slowed to near stagnation in recent years because of reduced death rates, increased birth rates and increased immigration.', u'In 2009, Russia recorded annual population growth for the first time in fifteen years, with total growth of 10,500.', u'279,906 migrants arrived to the Russian Federation the same year, of which 93% came from CIS countries.', u'The number of Russian emigrants steadily declined from 359,000 in 2000 to 32,000 in 2009.', u'There are also an estimated 10 million illegal immigrants from the ex-Soviet states in Russia.', u'Russia is home to approximately 116 million ethnic Russians and about 20 million ethnic Russians live outside Russia in the former republics of the Soviet Union, mostly in Ukraine and Kazakhstan.', u'The 2010 census recorded 81% of the population as ethnically Russian, and 19% as other ethnicities: 3.7% Tatars; 1.4% Ukrainians; 1.1% Bashkirs; 1% Chuvashes; 11.8% others and unspecified.', u'According to the Census, 84.93% of the Russian population belongs to European ethnic groups (Slavic, Germanic, Finnic other than Ugric, Greek, and others).', u'This is a decline from the 2002, when they constituted for more than 86% of the population.', u"Russia's birth rate is higher than that of most European countries (13.3 births per 1000 people in 2014 compared to the European Union average of 10.1 per 1000), but its death rate is also substantially higher (in 2014, Russia's death rate was 13.1 per 1000 people compared to the EU average of 9.7 per 1000).", u'The Russian Ministry of Health and Social Affairs predicted that by 2011 the death rate would equal the birth rate because of increase in fertility and decline in mortality.', u'The government is implementing a number of programs designed to increase the birth rate and attract more migrants.', u'Monthly government child-assistance payments were doubled to US$55, and a one-time payment of US$9,200 was offered to women who had a second child since 2007.', u'In 2006, in a bid to compensate for the country\'s demographic decline, the Russian government started simplifying immigration laws and launched a state program "for providing assistance to voluntary immigration of ethnic Russians from former Soviet republics".', u'In 2009 Russia experienced its highest birth rate since the dissolution of the Soviet Union.', u'In 2012, the birth rate increased again.', u'Russia recorded 1,896,263 births, the highest number since 1990, and even exceeding annual births during the period 1967\u20131969, with a TFR of about 1.7, the highest since 1991.', u"(Source: Vital statistics table below)\nIn August 2012, as the country saw its first demographic growth since the 1990s, President Putin declared that Russia's population could reach 146 million by 2025, mainly as a result of immigration.", u"=== Largest cities ===\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nRussia's 160 ethnic groups speak some 100 languages.", u'According to the 2002 Census, 142.6 million people speak Russian, followed by Tatar with 5.3 million and Ukrainian with 1.8 million speakers.', u'Russian is the only official state language, but the Constitution gives the individual republics the right to establish their own state languages in addition to Russian.', u'Despite its wide distribution, the Russian language is homogeneous throughout the country.', u'Russian is the most geographically widespread language of Eurasia, as well as the most widely spoken Slavic language.', u'It belongs to the Indo-European language family and is one of the living members of the East Slavic languages, the others being Belarusian and Ukrainian (and possibly Rusyn).', u'Written examples of Old East Slavic (Old Russian) are attested from the 10th century onwards.', u'Russian is the second-most used language on the Internet after English, one of two official languages aboard the International Space Station and is one of the six official languages of the UN.', u'35 languages are officially recognized in Russia in various regions by local governments.', u"=== Religion ===\n\nThe ancestors of many of today's Russians practised Orthodox Christianity since the 10th century.", u'According to the Orthodox Church Tradition, Christianity was first brought to the territory of modern Belarus, Russia and Ukraine by Saint Andrew, the first Apostle of Jesus Christ.', u"Following the Primary Chronicle, the definitive Christianization of Kievan Rus' dates from the year 988 (the year is disputed), when Vladimir the Great was baptized in Chersonesus and proceeded to baptize his family and people in Kiev.", u"The latter events are traditionally referred to as baptism of Rus' (Russian: \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0438, Ukrainian: \u0425\u0440\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0456) in Russian and Ukrainian literature.", u'At the time of the 1917 Revolution, the Russian Orthodox Church was deeply integrated into the autocratic state, enjoying official status.', u'This was a significant factor that contributed to the Bolshevik attitude to religion and the steps they took to control it.', u'Bolsheviks consisted of many people with non-Russian, Communist Russians and influential Jewish backgrounds such as Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky, Grigory Zinoviev, Lev Kamenev, Grigori Sokolnikov who were indifferent towards Christianity and based on the writings of Jewish philosopher Karl Marx with Marxism\u2013Leninism as an ideology went on to form the Communist party.', u'Thus the USSR became the first state to have, as an ideological objective, the elimination of religion and its replacement with universal atheism.', u'The communist regime confiscated religious property, ridiculed religion, harassed believers, and propagated atheism in schools.', u'The confiscation of religious assets was often based on accusations of illegal accumulation of wealth.', u'The vast majority of people in the Russian empire were, at the time of the revolution, religious believers, whereas the communists aimed to break the power of all religious institutions and eventually replace religious belief with atheism.', u'"Science" was counterposed to "religious superstition" in the media and in academic writing.', u'The main religions of pre-revolutionary Russia persisted throughout the entire Soviet period, but they were only tolerated within certain limits.', u'Generally, this meant that believers were free to worship in private and in their respective religious buildings (churches, mosques, etc.', u'), but public displays of religion outside of such designated areas were prohibited.', u'In addition, religious institutions were not allowed to express their views in any type of mass media, and many religious buildings were demolished or used for other purposes.', u'State Atheism in the Soviet Union was known as gosateizm, and was based on the ideology of Marxism\u2013Leninism.', u'Marxist\u2013Leninist Atheism has consistently advocated the control, suppression, and elimination of religion.', u'Within about a year of the revolution, the state expropriated all church property, including the churches themselves, and in the period from 1922 to 1926, 28 Russian Orthodox bishops and more than 1,200 priests were killed.', u'Many more were persecuted.', u'Currently, there is no official census of religion in Russia, and estimates are based on surveys only.', u'In August 2012, ARENA estimated that about 46.8% of Russians are Christians (including Orthodox, Catholic, Protestant, and non-denominational), while 25% believed in God but without any religion.', u'However, later that year, the Levada Center estimated that 76% of Russians are Christians, and in June 2013, the Public Opinion Foundation estimated that 65% of Russians are Christians.', u"These findings are in line with Pew Research Center's 2011 survey, which estimated that 73.6% of Russians are Christians, with Russian Public Opinion Research Center (VCIOM)'s 2010 survey (~77% Christian), and with Ipsos MORI's 2011 survey (69%).", u'Orthodox Christianity, Islam, Judaism and Buddhism are Russia\'s traditional religions, and are all legally a part of Russia\'s "historical heritage".', u"Traced back to the Christianization of Kievan Rus' in the 10th century, Russian Orthodoxy is the dominant religion in the country; smaller Christian denominations such as Catholics, Armenian Gregorians and various Protestant churches also exist.", u"The Russian Orthodox Church was the country's state religion prior to the Revolution and remains the largest religious body in the country.", u'An estimated 95% of the registered Orthodox parishes belong to the Russian Orthodox Church while there are a number of smaller Orthodox Churches.', u'However, the vast majority of Orthodox believers do not attend church on a regular basis.', u'Easter is the most popular religious holiday in Russia, celebrated by a large segment of the Russian population, including large numbers of those who are non-religious.', u'More than three-quarters of the Russian population celebrate Easter by making traditional Easter cakes, coloured eggs and paskha.', u'Islam is the second largest religion in Russia after Russian Orthodoxy.', u'It is the traditional or predominant religion amongst some Caucasian ethnicities (notably the Chechens, the Ingush and the Circassians), and amongst some Turkic peoples (notably the Tatars and the Bashkirs).', u"Altogether, there are 9,400,000 Muslims in Russia or 6.5% of the total population as of 2012 (the share of Muslims is probably much higher because the survey doesn't include detailed data for the traditionally Islamic states of Chechnya and Ingushetia).", u'Notwithstanding, various differences split the Muslim population in different groups.', u'According to the survey, most of the Muslims (approximately 6,700,000 or 4.6% of the total population) are "unaffiliated" to any Islamic schools and branches or Islamic organisation, this is mainly because it is not essential for Muslims to be affiliated with any specific sect or organization.', u'Those who are affiliated are mostly Sunni Muslims, with Shia and Ahmadiyya minorities.', u'Unaffiliated Muslims constitute significant numbers of over 10% in Kabardino-Balkaria (49%), Bashkortostan (38%), Karachay-Cherkessia (34%), Tatarstan (31%), Yamalia (13%), Orenburg Oblast (11%), Adygea (11%) and Astrakhan Oblast (11%).', u'Most of the regions of Siberia have an unaffiliated Muslim population of 1% to 2%.', u'Buddhism is traditional in three regions of the Russian Federation: Buryatia, Tuva, and Kalmykia.', u'Some residents of the Siberian and Far Eastern regions, such as Yakutia and Chukotka, practice shamanist, pantheistic, and pagan rites, along with the major religions.', u'Induction into religion takes place primarily along ethnic lines.', u'Slavs are significantly Orthodox Christian, Turkic speakers are predominantly Muslim, and Mongolic peoples are generally Buddhists.', u'According to various western purposive reports, the number of non-religious in Russia is between 16% and 48% of the population.', u'The number of atheists has decreased significantly; according to the recent statistic, only seven percent declared themselves atheists, a decrease of 5% in three years.', u'In a 2012 poll by Gallup International, 6% of Russian people reported that they were "convinced atheists which is lowest among European countries"\nIn cultural and social affairs Putin has collaborated closely with the Russian Orthodox Church.', u'Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, head of the Church, endorsed his election in 2012.', u'Steven Myers reports, "The church, once heavily repressed, had emerged from the Soviet collapse as one of the most respected institutions....Now Kiril led the faithful directly into an alliance with the state."', u'Mark Woods provides specific examples of how the Church under Patriarch Kirill of Moscow has backed the expansion of Russian power into Crimea and eastern Ukraine.', u"More broadly the New York Times reports in September 2016 how that Church's policy prescriptions support the Kremlin's appeal to social conservatives:\nA fervent foe of homosexuality and any attempt to put individual rights above those of family, community or nation, the Russian Orthodox Church helps project Russia as the natural ally of all those who pine for a more secure, illiberal world free from the tradition-crushing rush of globalization, multiculturalism and women\u2019s and gay rights.", u'=== Health ===\n\nThe Russian Constitution guarantees free, universal health care for all its citizens.', u'In practice, however, free health care is partially restricted because of mandatory registration.', u'While Russia has more physicians, hospitals, and health care workers than almost any other country in the world on a per capita basis, since the dissolution of the Soviet Union the health of the Russian population has declined considerably as a result of social, economic, and lifestyle changes; the trend has been reversed only in the recent years, with average life expectancy having increased 5.2 years for males and 3.1 years for females between 2006 and 2014.', u'As of 2014, the average life expectancy in Russia was 65.29 years for males and 76.49 years for females.', u'The biggest factor contributing to the relatively low life expectancy for males is a high mortality rate among working-age males.', u'Deaths mostly occur because of preventable causes (e.g., alcohol poisoning, smoking, traffic accidents, violent crime).', u'As a result of the large gender difference in life expectancy, and also because of the lasting effect of high casualties in World War II, the gender imbalance remains to this day; there are 0.859 males to every female.', u'=== Education ===\n\nRussia has the most college-level or higher graduates in terms of percentage of population in the world, at 54%.', u'Russia has a free education system, which is guaranteed for all citizens by the Constitution, however entry to subsidized higher education is highly competitive.', u'As a result of great emphasis on science and technology in education, Russian medical,

(1879\u20131962); and Carrie Gladys (1882\u20131959), who was left almost blind after a childhood accident.', u'Weisz arrived in the United States on July 3, 1878, on the SS Fresia with his mother (who was pregnant) and his four brothers.', u'The family changed their name to the German spelling Weiss, and Erik became Ehrich.', u'The family lived in Appleton, Wisconsin, where his father served as Rabbi of the Zion Reform Jewish Congregation.', u'According to the 1880 census, the family lived on Appleton Street.', u'On June 6, 1882, Rabbi Weiss became an American citizen.', u'Losing his tenure at Zion in 1887, Rabbi Weiss moved with Ehrich to New York City, where they lived in a boarding house on East 79th Street.', u'He was joined by the rest of the family once Rabbi Weiss found permanent housing.', u'As a child, Ehrich Weiss took several jobs, making his public d\xe9but as a 9-year-old trapeze artist, calling himself "Ehrich, the Prince of the Air".', u'He was also a champion cross country runner in his youth.', u'When Weiss became a professional magician he began calling himself "Harry Houdini", after the French magician Jean Eug\xe8ne Robert-Houdin, after reading Robert-Houdin\'s autobiography in 1890.', u'Weiss incorrectly believed that an i at the end of a name meant "like" in French.', u'In later life, Houdini claimed that the first part of his new name, Harry, was an homage to Harry Kellar, whom he also admired.', u'The magician Joseph Rinn had coached Houdini as a teenager at the Pastime Athletic Club.', u'Houdini was an active Freemason and was a member of St. Cecile Lodge #568 in New York City.', u'In 1918, he registered for selective service as Harry Handcuff Houdini.', u'== Magic career ==\n\nHe began his magic career in 1891, but had little success.', u'He appeared in a tent act with strongman Emil Jarrow.', u'He performed in dime museums and sideshows, and even doubled as "The Wild Man" at a circus.', u'Houdini focused initially on traditional card tricks.', u'At one point, he billed himself as the "King of Cards".', u'He soon began experimenting with escape acts.', u'In 1893, while performing with his brother "Dash" (Theodore) at Coney Island as "The Brothers Houdini," Harry met a fellow performer, Wilhelmina Beatrice "Bess" Rahner.', u'Bess was initially courted by Dash, but she and Houdini married in 1894, with Bess replacing Dash in the act, which became known as "The Houdinis."', u"For the rest of Houdini's performing career, Bess worked as his stage assistant.", u"Houdini's big break came in 1899 when he met manager Martin Beck in St. Paul, Minnesota.", u"Impressed by Houdini's handcuffs act, Beck advised him to concentrate on escape acts and booked him on the Orpheum vaudeville circuit.", u'Within months, he was performing at the top vaudeville houses in the country.', u'In 1900, Beck arranged for Houdini to tour Europe.', u"After some days of unsuccessful interviews in London, Houdini's British agent Harry Day helped him to get an interview with C. Dundas Slater, then manager of the Alhambra Theatre.", u'He was introduced to William Melville and gave a demonstration of escape from handcuffs at Scotland Yard.', u'He succeeded in baffling the police so effectively that he was booked at the Alhambra for six months.', u'His show was an immediate hit and his salary rose to $300 a week.', u'Houdini became widely known as "The Handcuff King."', u'He toured England, Scotland, the Netherlands, Germany, France, and Russia.', u'In each city, Houdini challenged local police to restrain him with shackles and lock him in their jails.', u'In many of these challenge escapes, Houdini was first stripped nude and searched.', u'In Moscow, Houdini escaped from a Siberian prison transport van.', u'Houdini claimed that, had he been unable to free himself, he would have had to travel to Siberia, where the only key was kept.', u'In Cologne, he sued a police officer, Werner Graff, who alleged that he made his escapes via bribery.', u"Houdini won the case when he opened the judge's safe (he later said the judge had forgotten to lock it).", u'With his new-found wealth, Houdini purchased a dress said to have been made for Queen Victoria.', u'He then arranged a grand reception where he presented his mother in the dress to all their relatives.', u'Houdini said it was the happiest day of his life.', u'In 1904, Houdini returned to the U.S. and purchased a house for $25,000, a brownstone at 278 W. 113th Street in Harlem, New York City.', u"In 1906, Houdini created his own publication, the Conjurers' Monthly Magazine.", u'It was a competitor to The Sphinx, but was short-lived and only two volumes were released until August 1908.', u'Magic historian Jim Steinmeyer has noted that "Houdini couldn\'t resist using the journal for his own crusades, attacking his rivals, praising his own appearances, and subtly rewriting history to favor his view of magic."', u'From 1907 and throughout the 1910s, Houdini performed with great success in the United States.', u'He freed himself from jails, handcuffs, chains, ropes, and straitjackets, often while hanging from a rope in sight of street audiences.', u'Because of imitators, on January 25, 1908, Houdini put his "handcuff act" behind him and began escaping from a locked, water-filled milk can.', u'The possibility of failure and death thrilled his audiences.', u'Houdini also expanded his repertoire with his escape challenge act, in which he invited the public to devise contraptions to hold him.', u'These included nailed packing crates (sometimes lowered into water), riveted boilers, wet sheets, mail bags, and even the belly of a whale that had washed ashore in Boston.', u'Brewers in Scranton, Pennsylvania and other cities challenged Houdini to escape from a barrel after they filled it with beer.', u'Many of these challenges were arranged with local merchants in one of the first uses of mass tie-in marketing.', u"Rather than promote the idea that he was assisted by spirits, as did the Davenport Brothers and others, Houdini's advertisements showed him making his escapes via dematerializing, although Houdini himself never claimed to have supernatural powers.", u'Whilst on tour in Europe in 1902, Houdini visited Blois with the aim of meeting the widow of Emile Houdin, the son of Jean Eug\xe8ne Robert-Houdin, for an interview and permission to visit his grave.', u'He did not receive permission but still visited the grave.', u'Houdini believed that he had been treated unfairly and later wrote a negative account of the incident in his magazine claiming he was "treated most discourteously by Madame W. Emile Robert-Houdin."', u'In 1906, he sent a letter to the French magazine L\'Illusionniste stating "You will certainly enjoy the article on Robert Houdin I am about to publish in my magazine.', u'Yes, my dear friend, I think I can finally demolish your idol, who has so long been placed on a pedestal that he did not deserve."', u'After much research, Houdini wrote a collection of articles on the history of magic, which were expanded into The Unmasking of Robert-Houdin published in 1908.', u'In this book he attacked his former idol Robert-Houdin as liar and a fraud for having claimed the invention of automata and effects such as aerial suspension, which had been in existence for many years.', u'Many of the allegations in the book were dismissed by magicians and researchers who defended Robert-Houdin.', u"Magician Jean Hugard would later write a full rebuttal to Houdini's book.", u'In 1913, Houdini introduced perhaps his most famous act, the Chinese Water Torture Cell, in which he was suspended upside-down in a locked glass-and-steel cabinet full to overflowing with water.', u'The act required that Houdini hold his breath for more than three minutes.', u'Houdini performed the escape for the rest of his career.', u'During his career, Houdini explained some of his tricks in books written for the magic brotherhood.', u'In Handcuff Secrets (1909), he revealed how many locks and handcuffs could be opened with properly applied force, others with shoestrings.', u'Other times, he carried concealed lockpicks or keys.', u'When tied down in ropes or straitjackets, he gained wiggle room by enlarging his shoulders and chest, moving his arms slightly away from his body.', u'His straitjacket escape was originally performed behind curtains, with him popping out free at the end.', u"Houdini's brother, (who was also an escape artist, billing himself as Theodore Hardeen), discovered that audiences were more impressed when the curtains were eliminated so they could watch him struggle to get out.", u'On more than one occasion, they both performed straitjacket escapes while dangling upside-down from the roof of a building in the same city.', u'For most of his career, Houdini was a headline act in vaudeville.', u'For many years, he was the highest-paid performer in American vaudeville.', u"One of Houdini's most notable non-escape stage illusions was performed at the New York Hippodrome, when he vanished a full-grown elephant from the stage.", u'He had purchased this trick from the magician Charles Morritt.', u"In 1923, Houdini became president of Martinka & Co., America's oldest magic company.", u'The business is still in operation today.', u'He also served as President of the Society of American Magicians (aka S.A.M.)', u'from 1917 until his death in 1926.', u"Founded on May 10, 1902, in the back room of Martinka's magic shop in New York, the Society expanded under the leadership of Harry Houdini during his term as National President from 1917 to 1926.", u"Houdini was magic's greatest visionary.", u'He sought to create a large, unified national network of professional and amateur magicians.', u'Wherever he traveled, Houdini gave a lengthy formal address to the local magic club, made speeches, and usually threw a banquet for the members at his own expense.', u'He said "The Magicians Clubs as a rule are small: they are weak...but if we were amalgamated into one big body the society would be stronger, and it would mean making the small clubs powerful and worth while.', u'Members would find a welcome wherever they happened to be and, conversely, the safeguard of a city-to-city hotline to track exposers and other undesirables."', u'For most of 1916, while on his vaudeville tour, Houdini, at his own expense, had been recruiting local magic clubs to join the S.A.M.', u'in an effort to revitalize what he felt was a weak organization.', u'Houdini persuaded groups in Buffalo, Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Kansas City to join.', u'As had happened in London, Houdini persuaded magicians to join.', u'The Buffalo club joined as the first branch, (later assembly) of the Society.', u'Chicago Assembly No.', u'3 was, as the name implies, the third regional club to be established by the S.A.M., whose assemblies now number in the hundreds.', u"In 1917, he signed Assembly Number Three's charter into existence, and that charter and this club continue to provide Chicago magicians with a connection to each other and to their past.", u'Houdini dined with, addressed, and got pledges from similar clubs in Detroit, Rochester, Pittsburgh, Kansas City, Cincinnati and elsewhere.', u'This was the biggest movement ever in the history of magic.', u'In places where no clubs existed, he rounded up individual magicians, introduced them to each other, and urged them into the fold.', u"By the end of 1916, magicians' clubs in San Francisco and other cities that Houdini had not visited were offering to become assemblies.", u'He had created the richest and longest-surviving organization of magicians in the world.', u'It now embraces almost 6,000 dues-paying members and almost 300 assemblies worldwide.', u'In July 1926, Houdini was elected for the ninth successive time President of the Society of American Magicians.', u'Every other president has only served for one year.', u"He also was President of the Magicians' Club of London.", u'In the final years of his life (1925/26), Houdini launched his own full-evening show, which he billed as "Three Shows in One: Magic, Escapes, and Fraud Mediums Exposed".', u'== Notable escapes ==\n\n\n=== Mirror challenge ===\n\nIn 1904, the London Daily Mirror newspaper challenged Houdini to escape from special handcuffs that it claimed had taken Nathaniel Hart, a locksmith from Birmingham, five years to make.', u"Houdini accepted the challenge for March 17 during a matin\xe9e performance at London's Hippodrome theater.", u'It was reported that 4000 people and more than 100 journalists turned out for the much-hyped event.', u'The escape attempt dragged on for over an hour, during which Houdini emerged from his "ghost house" (a small screen used to conceal the method of his escape) several times.', u'On one occasion he asked if the cuffs could be removed so he could take off his coat.', u'The Mirror representative, Frank Parker, refused, saying Houdini could gain an advantage if he saw how the cuffs were unlocked.', u'Houdini promptly took out a pen-knife and, holding the knife in his teeth, used it to cut his coat from his body.', u"Some 56 minutes later, Houdini's wife appeared on stage and gave him a kiss.", u'Many thought that in her mouth was the key to unlock the special handcuffs.', u'However, it has since been suggested that Bess did not in fact enter the stage at all, and that this theory is unlikely due to the size of the 6-inch key Houdini then went back behind the curtain.', u'After an hour and ten minutes, Houdini emerged free.', u'As he was paraded on the shoulders of the cheering crowd, he broke down and wept.', u'Houdini later said it was the most difficult escape of his career.', u"After Houdini's death, his friend Martin Beck was quoted in Will Goldston's book, Sensational Tales of Mystery Men, as admitting that Houdini was bested that day and had appealed to his wife, Bess, for help.", u'Goldston goes on to claim that Bess begged the key from the Mirror representative, then slipped it to Houdini in a glass of water.', u'It was stated in the book The Secret Life of Houdini that the key required to open the specially designed Mirror handcuffs was 6 inches long, and could not have been smuggled to Houdini in a glass of water.', u'Goldston offered no proof of his account, and many modern biographers have found evidence (notably in the custom design of the handcuffs) that the Mirror challenge may have been arranged by Houdini and that his long struggle to escape was pure showmanship.', u"This escape was discussed in depth on the Travel Channel's Mysteries at the Museum in an interview with Houdini expert, magician and escape artist Dorothy Dietrich of Scranton's Houdini Museum.", u'A full-sized design of the same Mirror Handcuffs, as well as a replica of the Bramah style key for it, is on display to the public at The Houdini Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania.', u'This set of cuffs is believed to be one of only six in the world, some of which are not on display.', u'=== Milk can escape ===\nIn 1908, Houdini introduced his own original act, the milk can escape.', u'In this act, Houdini was handcuffed and sealed inside an oversized milk can filled with water and made his escape behind a curtain.', u'As part of the effect, Houdini invited members of the audience to hold their breath along with him while he was inside the can.', u'Advertised with dramatic posters that proclaimed "Failure Means A Drowning Death," the escape proved to be a sensation.', u'Houdini soon modified the escape to include the milk can being locked inside a wooden chest, being chained or padlocked.', u'Houdini performed the milk can escape as a regular part of his act for only four years, but it has remained one of the acts most associated with him.', u"Houdini's brother, Theodore Hardeen, continued to perform the milk can escape and its wooden chest variant into the 1940s.", u'The American Museum of Magic has the milk can and overboard box used by Houdini.', u'=== Chinese water torture cell ===\n\nAround 1912, the vast number of imitators prompted Houdini to replace his milk can act with the Chinese water torture cell.', u"In this escape, Houdini's feet were locked in stocks, and he was lowered upside down into a tank filled with water.", u'The mahogany and metal cell featured a glass front, through which audiences could clearly see Houdini.', u'The stocks were locked to the top of the cell, and a curtain concealed his escape.', u'In the earliest version of the torture cell, a metal cage was lowered into the cell, and Houdini was enclosed inside that.', u'While making the escape more difficult - the cage prevented Houdini from turning - the cage bars also offered protection should the front glass break.', u'The original cell was built in England, where Houdini first performed the escape for an audience of one person as part of a one-act play he called "Houdini Upside Down."', u'This was so he could copyright the effect and have grounds to sue imitators, which he did.', u'While the escape was advertised as "The Chinese Water Torture Cell" or "The Water Torture Cell," Houdini always referred to it as "the Upside Down" or "USD".', u'The first public performance of the USD was at the Circus Busch in Berlin, on September 21, 1912.', u'Houdini continued to perform the escape until his death in 1926.', u"=== Suspended straitjacket escape ===\nOne of Houdini's most popular publicity stunts was to have himself strapped into a regulation straitjacket and suspended by his ankles from a tall building or crane.", u'Houdini would then make his escape in full view of the assembled crowd.', u'In many cases, Houdini drew tens of thousands of onlookers who brought city traffic to a halt.', u'Houdini would sometimes ensure press coverage by performing the escape from the office building of a local newspaper.', u'In New York City, Houdini performed the suspended straitjacket escape from a crane being used to build the New York subway.', u'After flinging his body in the air, he escaped from the straitjacket.', u'Starting from when he was hoisted up in the air by the crane, to when the straitjacket was completely off, it took him two minutes and thirty-seven seconds.', u'There is film footage in the Library of Congress of Houdini performing the escape.', u'Films of his escapes are also shown at The Houdini Museum in Scranton, PA. After being battered against a building in high winds during one escape, Houdini performed the escape with a visible safety wire on his ankle so that he could be pulled away from the building if necessary.', u"The idea for the upside-down escape was given to Houdini by a young boy named Randolph Osborne Douglas (March 31, 1895 \u2013 December 5, 1956), when the two met at a performance at Sheffield's Empire Theatre.", u"=== Overboard box escape ===\n\nAnother of Houdini's most famous publicity stunts was to escape from a nailed and roped packing crate after it had been lowered into water.", u"Houdini first performed the escape in New York's East River on July 7, 1912.", u'Police forbade him from using one of the piers, so Houdini hired a tugboat and invited press on board.', u'Houdini was locked in handcuffs and leg-irons, then nailed into the crate which was roped and weighed down with two hundred pounds of lead.', u'The crate was then lowered into the water.', u'Houdini escaped in 57 seconds.', u'The crate was pulled to the surface and found still to be intact, with the manacles inside.', u"Houdini performed this escape many times, and even performed a version on stage, first at Hamerstein's Roof Garden where a 5,500-US-gallon (21,000 l) tank was specially built, and later at the New York Hippodrome.", u'=== Buried alive stunt ===\nHoudini performed at least three variations on a buried alive stunt during his career.', u'The first was near Santa Ana, California in 1915, and it almost cost Houdini his life.', u'Houdini was buried, without a casket, in a pit of earth six feet deep.', u'He became exhausted and panicked while trying to dig his way to the surface and called for help.', u'When his hand finally broke the surface, he fell unconscious and had to be pulled from the grave by his assistants.', u'Houdini wrote in his diary that the escape was "very dangerous" and that "the weight of the earth is killing."', u"Houdini's second variation on buried alive was an endurance test designed to expose mystical Egyptian performer Rahman Bey, who had claimed to use supernatural powers to remain in a sealed casket for an hour.", u"Houdini bettered Bey on August 5, 1926, by remaining in a sealed casket, or coffin, submerged in the swimming pool of New York's Hotel Shelton for one and a half hours.", u'Houdini claimed he did not use any trickery or supernatural powers to accomplish this feat, just controlled breathing.', u'He repeated the feat at the YMCA in Worcester, Massachusetts on September 28, 1926, this time remaining sealed for one hour and eleven minutes.', u"Houdini's final buried alive was an elaborate stage escape that featured in his full evening show.", u'Houdini escaped after being strapped in a straitjacket, sealed in a casket, and then buried in a large tank filled with sand.', u'While posters advertising the escape exist (playing off the Bey challenge by boasting "Egyptian Fakirs Outdone!', u'"), it is unclear whether Houdini ever performed buried alive on stage.', u'The stunt was to be the feature escape of his 1927 season, but Houdini died on October 31, 1926.', u"The bronze casket Houdini created for buried alive was used to transport Houdini's body from Detroit to New York following his death on Halloween.", u'== Movie career ==\n\nIn 1906, Houdini started showing films of his outside escapes as part of his vaudeville act.', u'In Boston, he presented a short film called Houdini Defeats Hackenschmidt.', u'Georg Hackenschmidt was a famous wrestler of the day, but the nature of their contest is unknown as the film is lost.', u'In 1909, Houdini made a film in Paris for Cinema Lux titled Merveilleux Exploits du C\xe9l\xe9bre Houdini \xe0 Paris (Marvellous Exploits of the Famous Houdini in Paris).', u"It featured a loose narrative designed to showcase several of Houdini's famous escapes, including his straitjacket and underwater handcuff escapes.", u'That same year Houdini got an offer to star as Captain Nemo in a silent version of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, but the project never made it into production.', u'It is often erroneously reported that Houdini served as special-effects consultant on the Wharton/International cliffhanger serial, The Mysteries of Myra, shot in Ithaca, New York, because Harry Grossman, director of The Master Mystery also filmed a serial in Ithaca at about the same time.', u'The consultants on the serial were pioneering Hereward Carrington and Aleister Crowley.', u'In 1918, Houdini signed a contract with film producer B.A.', u'Rolfe to star in a 15-part serial, The Master Mystery (released in January 1919).', u'As was common at the time, the film serial was released simultaneously with a novel.', u'Financial difficulties resulted in B.A.', u'Rolfe Productions going out of business, but The Master Mystery led to Houdini being signed by Famous Players-Lasky Corporation/Paramount Pictures, for whom he made two pictures, The Grim Game (1919) and Terror Island (1920).', u"The Grim Game was Houdini's first full-length movie and is reputed to be his best.", u'Because of the flammable nature of nitrate film and the inherent chemical instability of the acetate "safety" film that supplanted it, only 10 percent of old silent movies exist.', u'Film historians considered the film lost.', u'One copy did exist hidden in the collection of a private collector only known to a tiny group of magicians that saw it.', u'Dick Brookz and Dorothy Dietrich of The Houdini Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania had seen it twice on the invitation of the collector.', u'After many years of trying, they finally got him to agree to sell the film to Turner Classic Movies who restored the complete 71-minute film.', u'The film, not seen by the general public for 96 years was shown by TCM on March 29, 2015, as a highlight of their yearly 4-day festival in Hollywood.', u'While filming an aerial stunt for The Grim Game, two biplanes collided in mid-air with a stuntman doubling Houdini dangling by a rope from one of the planes.', u'Publicity was geared heavily toward promoting this dramatic "caught on film" moment, claiming it was Houdini himself dangling from the plane.', u'While filming these movies in Los Angeles, Houdini rented a home in Laurel Canyon.', u'Following his two-picture stint in Hollywood, Houdini returned to New York and started his own film production company called the "Houdini Picture Corporation".', u'He produced and starred in two films, The Man from Beyond (1921) and Haldane of the Secret Service (1923).', u'He also founded his own film laboratory business called The Film Development Corporation (FDC), gambling on a new process for developing motion picture film.', u"Houdini's brother, Theodore Hardeen, left his own career as a magician and escape artist to run the company.", u'Magician Harry Kellar was a major investor.', u'Neither Houdini\'s acting career nor FDC found success, and he gave up on the movie business in 1923, complaining that "the profits are too meager".', u"In April 2008, Kino International released a DVD box set of Houdini's surviving silent films, including The Master Mystery, Terror Island, The Man From Beyond, Haldane of the Secret Service, and five minutes from The Grim Game.", u"The set also includes newsreel footage of Houdini's escapes from 1907 to 1923, and a section from Merveilleux Exploits du C\xe9l\xe9bre Houdini \xe0 Paris, although it is not identified as such.", u'== Aviator ==\nIn 1909, Houdini became fascinated with aviation.', u'He purchased a French Voisin biplane for $5,000 and hired a full-time mechanic, Antonio Brassac.', u'After crashing once, he made his first successful flight on November 26 in Hamburg, Germany.', u'The following year, Houdini toured Australia.', u'He brought along his Voisin biplane with the intention to be the first person in Australia to fly.', u'=== Falsely reported as pioneer ===\nOn March 18, 1910, he made three flights at Diggers Rest, Victoria, near Melbourne.', u'It was reported at the time that this was the first aerial flight in Australia, and a century later, some major news outlets still credit him with this feat.', u'Wing Commander Harry Cobby wrote in Aircraft in March 1938 that "the first aeroplane flight in the Southern Hemisphere was made on December 9, 1909 by Mr Colin Defries, a Londoner, at Victoria Park Racecourse, Sydney, in a Wilbur Wright aeroplane".', u'Colin Defries was a trained pilot, having learnt to fly in Cannes, France.', u'By modern standards his flight time was minimal, but in 1909 he had accumulated enough to become an instructor.', u'On his first flight he took off, maintained straight and level flight, albeit briefly, and landed safely.', u'His crash landing on his second flight, when he tried to retrieve his hat which was blown off, demonstrated what a momentary lack of attention could cause while flying a Wright Model A.', u'It is accepted by Australian historians and the Aviation Historical Society of Australia that the definition of flight established by the Gorell Committee on behalf of the Aero Club of Great Britain dictates the acceptance of a flight or its rejection, giving Colin Defries credit as the first to make an aeroplane flight in Australia, and the Southern Hemisphere.', u'Additionally, aviation pioneer Richard Pearse is believed by many New Zealand historians to have undertaken his first flight as early as 1902, which would give him not only the Southern Hemisphere but the World record, although this is disputed.', u'In 1965, aviation journalist Stanley Brogden formed the view that the first powered flight in Australia took place at Bolivar in South Australia; the aircraft was a Bleriot monoplane with Fred Custance as the pilot.', u'The flight took place on March 17, 1910.', u"The next day when Houdini took to the air, the Herald newspaper reported Custance's flight, stating it had lasted 5 minutes 25 seconds at a height of between 12 and 15 feet.", u'In 2010, Australia Post issued stamps commemorating Colin Defries, Houdini and John Robertson Duigan, crediting only Defries and Duigan with historical firsts.', u'Duigan was an Australian pioneer aviator who built and flew the first Australian-made aircraft.', u"Australia Post did acknowledge the part Houdini played (Harry Houdini can't escape being part of Australia's history) but did not attribute any record to him.", u'=== After Australia ===\nAfter completing his Australia tour, Houdini put the Voisin into storage in England.', u'He announced he would use it to fly from city to city during his next Music Hall tour, and even promised to leap from it handcuffed, but he never flew again.', u'== Debunking spiritualists ==\n\nIn the 1920s, Houdini turned his energies toward debunking psychics and mediums, a pursuit that inspired and was followed by latter-day stage magicians.', u"Houdini's training in magic allowed him to expose frauds who had successfully fooled many scientists and academics.", u'He was a member of a Scientific American committee that offered a cash prize to any medium who could successfully demonstrate supernatural abilities.', u'None was able to do so, and the prize was never collected.', u'The first to be tested was medium George Valiantine of Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania.', u'As his fame as a "ghostbuster" grew, Houdini took to attending s\xe9ances in disguise, accompanied by a reporter and police officer.', u'Possibly the most famous medium whom he debunked was Mina Crandon, also known as "Margery".', u'Joaqu\xedn Argamasilla known as the "Spaniard with X-ray Eyes" claimed to be able to read handwriting or numbers on dice through closed metal boxes.', u'In 1924, he was exposed by Houdini as a fraud.', u'Argamasilla peeked through his simple blindfold and lifted up the edge of the box so he could look inside it without others noticing.', u'Houdini also investigated the Italian medium Nino Pecoraro, whom he considered to be fraudulent.', u"Houdini's exposing of phony mediums has inspired other magicians to follow suit, including The Amazing Randi, Dorothy Dietrich, Penn & Teller, and Dick Brookz.", u'Houdini chronicled his debunking exploits in his book, A Magician Among the Spirits, co-authored with C. M. Eddy, Jr., who was not credited.', u'These activities cost Houdini the friendship of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.', u"Doyle, a firm believer in spiritualism during his later years, refused to believe any of Houdini's expos\xe9s.", u'Doyle came to believe that Houdini was a powerful spiritualist medium, and had performed many of his stunts by means of paranormal abilities and was using these abilities to block those of other mediums that he was "debunking".', u'This disagreement led to the two men becoming public antagonists and led Sir Arthur to view Houdini as a dangerous enemy.', u'Before Houdini died, he and his wife agreed that if Houdini found it possible to communicate after death, he would communicate the message "Rosabelle believe", a secret code which they agreed to use.', u'Rosabelle was their favorite song.', u"Bess held yearly s\xe9ances on Halloween for ten years after Houdini's death.", u'She did claim to have contact through Arthur Ford in 1929 when Ford conveyed the secret code, but Bess later said the incident had been faked.', u'The code seems to have been such that it could be broken by Ford or his associates using existing clues.', u"Evidence to this effect was discovered by Ford's biographer after he died in 1971.", u'In 1936, after a last unsuccessful s\xe9ance on the roof of the Knickerbocker Hotel, she put out the candle that she had kept burning beside a photograph of Houdini since his death.', u'In 1943, Bess said that "ten years is long enough to wait for any man."', u'The tradition of holding a s\xe9ance for Houdini continues, held by magicians throughout the world.', u'The Official Houdini S\xe9ance was organized in the 1940s by Sidney Hollis Radner, a Houdini aficionado from Holyoke, Massachusetts.', u'Yearly Houdini s\xe9ances are also conducted in Chicago at the Excalibur nightclub by "necromancer" Neil Tobin on behalf of the Chicago Assembly of the Society of American Magicians; and at the Houdini Museum in Scranton by magician Dorothy Dietrich, who previously held them at New York\'s Magic Towne House with such magical notables as Houdini biographers Walter B. Gibson and Milbourne Christopher.', u'Gibson was asked by Bess Houdini to carry on the original seance tradition.', u"After doing them for many years at New York's Magic Towne House, before he died, Walter passed on the tradition of conducting of the Original Seances to Dorothy Dietrich.", u'In 1926, Harry Houdini hired H. P. Lovecraft and his friend C. M. Eddy, Jr., to write an entire book about debunking religious miracles, which was to be called The Cancer of Superstition.', u'Houdini had earlier asked Lovecraft to write an article about astrology, for which he paid $75.', u'The article does not survive.', u"Lovecraft's detailed synopsis for Cancer does survive, as do three chapters of the treatise written by Eddy.", u"Houdini's death derailed the plans, as his widow did not wish to pursue the project.", u'== Appearance and voice recordings ==\n\nUnlike the image of the classic magician, Houdini was short and stocky and typically appeared on stage in a long frock coat and tie.', u'Most biographers give his height as 5 ft 5 in, but descriptions vary.', u'Houdini was also said to be slightly bow-legged, which aided in his ability to gain slack during his rope escapes.', u'In the 1997 biography Houdini!!!', u': The Career of Ehrich Weiss, author Kenneth Silverman summarizes how reporters described Houdini\'s appearance during his early career:\n\nThey stressed his smallness\u2014"somewhat undersized"\u2014and angular, vivid features: "He is smooth-shaven with a keen, sharp-chinned, sharp-cheekboned face, bright blue eyes and thick, curly, black hair."', u'Some sensed how much his complexly expressive smile was the outlet of his charismatic stage presence.', u'It communicated to audiences at once warm amiability, pleasure in performing, and, more subtly, imperious self-assurance.', u'Several reporters tried to capture the charming effect, describing him as "happy-looking", "pleasant-faced", "good natured at all times", "the young Hungarian magician with the pleasant smile and easy confidence".', u'Houdini made the only known recordings of his voice on Edison wax cylinders on October 29, 1914, in Flatbush, New York.', u'On them, Houdini practices several different introductory speeches for his famous Chinese water torture cell.', u'He also invites his sister, Gladys, to recite a poem.', u'Houdini then recites the same poem in German.', u'The six wax cylinders were discovered in the collection of magician John Mulholland after his death in 1970.', u'They are part of the David Copperfield collection.', u"== Death ==\n\nHarry Houdini died of peritonitis, secondary to a ruptured appendix at 1:26 p.m. on October 31, 1926 in Room 401 at Detroit's Grace Hospital, aged 52.", u'In his final days, he optimistically held to a strong belief that he would recover, but his last words before dying were reportedly, "I\'m tired of fighting."', u"Eyewitnesses to an incident at Houdini's dressing room in the Princess Theatre in Montreal gave rise to speculation that Houdini's death was caused by a McGill University student, J. Gordon Whitehead, who delivered a surprise attack of multiple blows to Houdini's abdomen.", u'The eyewitnesses, students named Jacques Price and Sam Smilovitz (sometimes called Jack Price and Sam Smiley), proffered accounts of the incident that generally corroborated one another.', u'Price describes Whitehead asking Houdini "if he believed in the miracles of the Bible" and "whether it was true that punches in the stomach did not hurt him".', u'He then delivered "some very hammer-like blows below the belt".', u'Houdini was reclining on a couch at the time, having broken his ankle while performing several days earlier.', u'Price states that Houdini winced at each blow and stopped Whitehead suddenly in the midst of a punch, gesturing that he had enough, and adding that he had no opportunity to prepare himself against the blows, as he did not expect Whitehead to strike him so suddenly and forcefully.', u'Had his ankle not been broken, he would have risen from the couch into a better position to brace himself.', u'Throughout the evening, Houdini performed in great pain.', u'He was unable to sleep and remained in constant pain for the next two days, but did not seek medical help.', u'When he finally saw a doctor, he was found to have a fever of 102 \xb0F (39 \xb0C) and acute appendicitis, and advised to have immediate surgery.', u'He ignored the advice and decided to go on with the show.', u'When Houdini arrived at the Garrick Theater in Detroit, Michigan, on October 24, 1926, for what would be his last performance, he had a fever of 104 \xb0F (40 \xb0C).', u'Despite the diagnosis, Houdini took the stage.', u'He was reported to have passed out during the show, but was revived and continued.', u"Afterwards, he was hospitalized at Detroit's Grace Hospital.", u"It is not entirely clear what relationship the encounter in the dressing room had on Houdini's eventual death.", u'As Snopes points out, the relationship between blunt trauma and appendicitis is not clear.', u'One theory suggests that Houdini was unaware that he was suffering from appendicitis.', u'If he had not realized that his stomach pains were symptomatic of appendicitis, he would not have appreciated the potentially critical effect of the blows to his abdomen.', u"After taking statements from Price and Smilovitz, Houdini's insurance company concluded that the death was due to the dressing-room incident and paid double indemnity.", u"== Houdini grave site ==\nHoudini's funeral was held on November 4, 1926, in New York City, with more than 2,000 mourners in attendance.", u'He was interred in the Machpelah Cemetery in Glendale, Queens, with the crest of the Society of American Magicians inscribed on his grave site.', u'A statuary bust was added to the exedra in 1927, a rarity, because graven images are forbidden in Jewish cemeteries.', u'In 1975, the bust was destroyed by vandals.', u"Temporary busts were placed at the grave until 2011 when a group who came to be called The Houdini Commandos from the Houdini Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania placed a permanent bust with the permission of Houdini's family and of the cemetery.", u'The Society of American Magicians took responsibility for the upkeep of the site, as Houdini had willed a large sum of money to the organization he had grown from one club to 5,000-6,000 dues-paying membership worldwide.', u"The payment of upkeep was abandoned by the society's dean George Schindler, who said \u201cHoudini paid for perpetual care, but there\u2019s nobody at the cemetery to provide it,\u201d adding that the operator of the cemetery, David Jacobson, \u201csends us a bill for upkeep every year but we never pay it because he never provides any care.\u201d The Society tidies the grave themselves.", u'Machpelah Cemetery operator Jacobson said, they "never paid the cemetery for any restoration of the Houdini family plot in my tenure since 1988," claiming that the money came from the cemetery\'s dwindling funds.', u"The granite monuments of Houdini's sister, Gladys, and brother, Leopold were also destroyed by vandals.", u'For many years, until recently, The Houdini grave site has been only cared for by Dorothy Dietrich and Dick Brookz of the Houdini Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania.', u"The Society of American Magicians, at its National Council Meeting in Boca Raton, Florida, in 2013, under the prompting of The Houdini Museum's Dorothy Dietrich and Dick Brookz, voted to assume the financial responsibilities for the care and maintenance of the Houdini Gravesite.", u'In MUM Magazine, the Society\'s official magazine, President Dal Sanders announced "Harry Houdini is an icon as revered as Elvis Presley or Marilyn Monroe.', u'He is not only a magical icon; his gravesite bears the seal of The Society of American Magicians.', u'That seal is our brand and we should be proud to protect it.', u'This gravesite is clearly our responsibility and I\u2019m proud to report that the National Council unanimously voted to maintain Houdini\u2019s final resting place."', u'The Houdini Gravesite Restoration Committee under the Chairmanship of National President David Bowers, is working closely with National President Kenrick "Ice" McDonald to see this project to completion.', u'Bowers said it is a foregone conclusion that the Society will approve the funding request, because \u201cHoudini is responsible for the Society of American Magicians being what it is today.', u'We owe a debt of gratitude to him.\u201d Like Bowers, McDonald said the motivation behind the repairs is to properly honor the grave of the \u201cBabe Ruth of magicians.\u201d \u201cThis is hallowed ground,\u201d he said.', u'\u201cWhen you ask people about magicians, the first thing they say is Harry Houdini.\u201d While the actual plot will remain under the control of Machpelah Cemetery management, the Society of American Magicians, with the help of the Houdini Museum in Pennsylvania, will be in charge of the restoration.', u'Magicians Dorothy Dietrich and Dick Brookz have been caring for the escape artist\u2019s Queens grave over the years.', u'\u201cThis is a monument where people go and visit on a daily basis,\u201d said Dietrich who is spearheading restoration efforts.', u'"The nearly 80-year-old popular plot at the Machpelah Cemetery has fallen into disrepair over the years."', u'"The Houdini Museum has teamed with The Society of American Magicians, one of the oldest fraternal magic organizations in the world, to give the beloved site a facelift."', u'The organization has a specific Houdini gravesite committee made up of nine members headed up by President elect David Bowers who brought this project to the Society\u2019s attention.', u'Kenrick \u201cIce\u201d McDonald, the current president of the Society of American Magicians said \u201cYou have to know the history.', u'Houdini served as President from 1917 until his death in 1926.', u'Houdini\u2019s burial site needs an infusion of cash to restore it to its former glory."', u'Magician Dietrich said the repairs could cost \u201ctens of thousands of dollars,\u201d after consulting with glass experts and grave artisans.', u'\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful project, but it\u2019s taken a lifetime to get people interested,\u201d she said.', u'\u201cIt\u2019s long overdue, and it\u2019s great that it\u2019s happening.\u201d Houdini was a living superhero,\u201d Dietrich said.', u'\u201cHe wasn\u2019t just a magician and escape artist, he was great humanitarian.\u201d\nTo this day, the Society holds a broken wand ceremony at the grave every November.', u"Houdini's widow, Bess, died of a heart attack on February 11, 1943, aged 67, in Needles, California while on a train en route from Los Angeles to New York City.", u'She had expressed a wish to be buried next to her husband, but instead was interred 35 miles due north at the Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Westchester County, New York, as her Catholic family refused to allow her to be buried in a Jewish cemetery.', u"=== Proposed exhumation ===\nOn March 22, 2007, Houdini's grand-nephew (the grandson of his brother Theo), George Hardeen, announced that the courts would be asked to allow exhumation of Houdini's body, to investigate the possibility of Houdini being murdered by spiritualists, as suggested in the biography The Secret Life of Houdini.", u'In a statement given to the Houdini Museum in Scranton, the family of Bess Houdini opposed the application and suggested it was a publicity ploy for the book.', u'The Washington Post stated that the press conference was not arranged by the family of Houdini.', u'Instead, the Post reported, it was orchestrated by authors Kalush and Sloman, who hired the PR firm Dan Klores Communications to promote their book.', u'In 2008, it was revealed the parties involved never filed legal papers to perform an exhumation.', u"== Legacy ==\n\nHoudini's brother, Theodore Hardeen, who returned to performing after Houdini's death, inherited his brother's effects and props.", u'Houdini\'s will stipulated that all the effects should be "burned and destroyed" upon Hardeen\'s death.', u'Hardeen sold much of the collection to magician and Houdini enthusiast Sidney Hollis Radner during the 1940s, including the water torture cell.', u'Radner allowed choice pieces of the collection to be displayed at The Houdini Magical Hall of Fame in Niagara Falls, Ontario.', u'In 1995, a fire destroyed the museum.', u"The water torture cell's metal frame remained, and it was restored by illusion builder John Gaughan.", u"Many of the props contained in the museum such as the mirror handcuffs, Houdini's original packing crate, a milk can, and a straitjacket, survived the fire and were auctioned in 1999 and 2008.", u'Radner loaned the bulk of his collection for archiving to the Outagamie Museum in Appleton, Wisconsin; but reclaimed it in 2003, and auctioned it in Las Vegas, on October 30, 2004.', u'Houdini was a "formidable collector," and bequeathed many of his holdings and paper archives on magic and spiritualism to the Library of Congress, which became the basis for the Houdini collection in cyberspace.', u"More than half of Houdini's archival estate holdings and memorabilia were willed to his fellow magician and friend, John Mulholland (1898\u20131970).", u"In 1991, illusionist and television performer David Copperfield purchased all of Mulholland's Houdini holdings from Mulholland's estate.", u"These are now archived and preserved in Copperfield's warehouse at his headquarters in Las Vegas.", u"It contains the world's largest collection of Houdini memorabilia, and preserves approximately 80,000 items of memorabilia of Houdini and other magicians, including Houdini's stage props and material, his rebuilt water torture cabinet and his metamorphosis trunk.", u'It is not open to the public, but tours are available by invitation to magicians, scholars, researchers, journalists and serious collectors.', u'In a posthumous ceremony on October 31, 1975, Houdini was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7001 Hollywood Blvd.', u'The Houdini Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania, bills itself as "the only building in the world entirely dedicated to Houdini".', u'It is open to the public year round by reservation.', u"It includes Houdini films, a

hitting coach for the Detroit Tigers.', u'== Playing career ==\nHarrah played high school baseball in his hometown of LaRue, Ohio and was scouted out but was not signed at graduation as most scouts thought he planned to attend college on a baseball scholarship.', u'A few months later, Tony Lucadello followed up and found that Harrah was not attending school, but was instead working in a factory in nearby Marion, Ohio.', u'Lucadello signed Harrah for the Philadelphia Phillies in December, 1966.', u'After one year in the Phillies organization, Harrah was drafted by the Washington Senators in the fall of 1967.', u'He advanced to the major league club in 1971; the next year the franchise relocated and became the Texas Rangers.', u'He was the regular shortstop through 1976, then moved to third base, although he still saw some action at short.', u'He was selected to the American League All-Star team in 1972, 1975, and 1976.', u'He had a career best 93 RBIS in 1975.', u'On June 26, 1976, Harrah played an entire doubleheader at shortstop without recording a single chance in the field.', u'In 1978, Toby was traded to the Cleveland Indians for Buddy Bell, a player thought to be fairly similar in many respects.', u'He was the Indians regular third baseman through 1983 and made the All-Star team in 1982.', u'That year he had 100 runs and a career best .304 batting average.', u'In 1984, Harrah was traded to the New York Yankees, where he was a part-time player, then he was traded again to the Rangers, where he played regularly again for the 1985 and 1986 seasons, primarily at second base.', u'With the retirement of Jeff Burroughs in 1985, Harrah became the last active major leaguer to have played for the Washington Senators franchise.', u'He was also the last player to see a pitch for the Senators in their final game on September 30, 1971 when Tommy McCraw was caught stealing during his plate-appearance for the Senators final out in the bottom of the 8th.', u'Harrah was noted for his good eye at the plate, placing in the top ten in the league for base on balls on nine occasions, including an AL-best 109 in 1977.', u'He finished his career with more base on balls than strikeouts, with 1153 and 868, respectively.', u'He also had better than average power for a defensive infielder, hitting 195 career home runs.', u'Combined with good speed, he accumulated three seasons of 20 home runs and 20 stolen bases.', u"Harrah's on-base skills and respectable slugging ability led to a solid career Adjusted OPS of 114.", u'According to sabermetrician Jay Jaffe of Baseball Prospectus, Harrah is the 25th best third baseman in Major League Baseball history, outpacing several Hall of Famers.', u'Despite his superior statistical accomplishments, Harrah only received a single vote for the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1992, thereby removing his name from future ballots.', u"Harrah's chances for the Hall were seemingly hurt by his multiple position switches: from shortstop, to third base, to second base, and often back and forth.", u'He did not match the awards or "counting stats" (avg, HR, RBI) of well-hitting contemporary shortstops like Cal Ripken Jr.

{'sentences': [u'Fly tying is the process of producing an artificial fly used by fly fishing anglers to catch fish.', u'Helen Shaw, an American professional fly tyer, defined it as the "simple process of binding various materials to a hook with thread".', u'However, thread is no longer always necessary since modern materials such as UV-cured resins can be used to fix the materials to the hook.', u'Fly tying requires some basic equipment, a fly pattern to follow or replicate, and the appropriate materials for the particular fly pattern selected.', u'Fly tying equipment enables the fly tyer to efficiently and effectively assemble and secure the materials on the hook.', u'Fly tying materials were originally limited to various furs, feathers, threads and hooks.', u'Today, many more natural and synthetic materials are used to tie flies.', u'Fly patterns are the instructions or recipe required to create the fly.', u'They specify hook sizes and types, the materials and colors to be used, as well as the sequence to be followed and the assembly methods.', u'There are thousands of possible fly patterns available to the tyer.', u'Hand-tied flies on the commercial market sell for under a US dollar to several US dollars each.', u'Fly tying is a challenging and rewarding hobby for some, a money-saving strategy for others, and a profitable commercial enterprise for the professional tyer.', u'The professional or commercial fly tyer may produce upwards of 36 thousand flies annually, whereas the amateur fly tyer may tie only a few flies each season for personal use.', u'== Approach ==\nSome view fly tying as an art form.', u'E. C. Gregg, in his 1940 publication, stated that "The object of this book will be throughout its entirety to teach in a practical manner the Art of Fly Tying in all its branches."', u'In contrast, A. K. Best suggests practical ways to streamline the tying technique.', u'Best emphasizes that fly tying is not only a handicraft but also a science rooted in carefully observing fish and their prey, and then designing and tying artificial flies to replicate that prey in order to catch fish.', u'One of the first contributions to this approach was made by Preston Jennings in his A Book of Trout Flies.', u'== Fly tying history ==\n\nThe history of fly tying (and fly design) reflects the evolution and history of fly fishing.', u'Basic fly-tying methods have not changed dramatically from the mid-19th century to the present.', u'Most changes resulted from the introduction and adaptation of new materials, especially synthetics, and new hook designs.', u'Images from the early literature devoted to fly tying and fly construction do not show processes significantly different from those used today.', u'The tools associated with fly tying today have, however, evolved along with new technologies.', u'In the mid-19th century flies were tied without benefit of a hook vise.', u'Instead, the hook was held by the fingers as the fly was constructed.', u'The following is from Rod Fishing in Clear Waters (London 1860):\n\nYour materials being now in a state of readiness, the hook must be first tied on with waxed silk to the finest end of the hair or gut left after cutting off the curled end, in this manner (Plate vii.', u'No.', u'1): Take the bend of the hook between your left finger and thumb, the shank projecting; place an end of the waxed silk, which should be about six inches in length, and the end of the gut along the underside of the shank; pass the silk over until you have wrapped it down to the end of the shank, and two or three turns back for the head of the fly; take the feather or hackle as prepared (Plate vii.', u'No.', u'2), put the point of the feather from where it is turned back with the outside next the hook, and hold it there with your left finger and thumb until you pass the silk over it, just where you left off, wrapping it twice or thrice on its downward rounds to the bend of the hook; take your scissors and cut off the root of the feather, and the superfluous gut under the bend of the hook, leaving it not quite so long as the body of the fly has to be made; take the thick end of your feather in your tweezers or pliers and wrap it over three or four times close together, following the silk wrappings until it is all, or as much as you deem sufficient, twirled on; then take your silk and pass over the end once or twice; cut off the superfluous part of the feather and wrap up the shank with the silk, evenly and regularly, to form the body of the fly, and fasten off by a loop-knot or two; or, if you want a thick-bodied fly or one of flossed silk, turn down again and fasten off at the shoulder; cut off the silk left, set the feather right with your needle and finger and thumb, and the fly is made or dressed.', u'This is the simplest method.', u'One of the earliest references to the use of a fly-tying vise is in Ogden on Fly Tying (London, 1887).', u'Other fly-tying tools\u2014scissors, hackle pliers, bodkins, etc.\u2014have remained remarkably similar over the last 120 years.', u'== Imitation of prey ==\nTying artificial flies has always been about imitating some form of fish prey.', u'Significant literature on the concepts of imitation exists especially for trout flies.', u'A Book of Trout Flies \u2013 Jennings (1935), Streamside Guide to Naturals & Their Imitations \u2013 Art Flick (1947), Matching the Hatch \u2013 Schweibert (1955), Selective Trout - Swisher and Richards (1971), Nymphs - Schweibert (1973), Caddisflies - LaFontaine (1989), Prey - Richards (1995) are a few 20th-century titles that deal extensively with imitating natural prey.', u'From a human perspective, many fly patterns do not exactly imitate fish prey found in nature, but they are nevertheless successful.', u'A successful or "killing" fly pattern imitates something that the target species preys on.', u'This has resulted in fly tyers and fishers devising additional terms to characterize those flies that obviously do not imitate anything in particular, yet are nevertheless successful at catching fish.', u'These additional terms are inconsistently but commonly associated with trout-fly patterns because of their huge variety, both historical and contemporary.', u'The term Attractor pattern has been applied to flies which resemble nothing in particular but are successful in attracting strikes from fish (Trout Fishing, Brooks 1972).', u'In Flies for Trout (1993) Dick Stewart characterizes these same patterns as General Purpose.', u'Dave Hughes, in Trout Flies-The Tier\u2019s Reference (1999), describes the same flies as Searching flies and characterizes three levels of imitation: Impressionistic, Suggestive and Imitative.', u'Paul Schullery in American Fly Fishing \u2013 A History (1996) and The Rise (2006) explains that although much has been written about imitation theories of fly design, all successful fly patterns must imitate something to attract the fish to strike.', u'The huge range of fly patterns documented today for all sorts of target species\u2014trout, salmon, bass and panfish, pike, saltwater, tropical exotics, etc.\u2014are not easily categorized as merely imitative, attractors, searching or impressionistic.', u'== Fly tying tools and materials ==\n\n\n=== Tools ===\n\nVarious tools enable and optimize fly tying.', u'Skip Morris, a professional fly tyer, lists the essential tools as being a vise to hold the hook of the fly to be tied, bobbins, a magnifying glass for delicate work, hackle pliers, hackle gauges, lights, hair stackers, and scissors.', u'Other optional tools are pliers, toothpicks, bodkins, dubbing twisters, blenders, floss bobbins, whip finishers, wing burners and bobbin threaders.', u'=== Materials ===\nFly tying material can be anything used to construct a fly on a hook.', u'Traditional materials were threads, yarns, furs, feathers, hair, tinsels, cork, balsa and wire.', u"Today's materials include not only all sorts of natural and dyed furs, hair and feathers, but also a wide array of synthetic materials.", u'Rabbit, mink, muskrat, fox, bear, squirrel and other furs, deer, elk, moose hair and chicken, pheasant, turkey, duck, goose and partridge feathers are commonly incorporated into artificial flies.', u'Chicken neck and saddle hackle, so essential for many artificial fly patterns, are from animals especially bred to produce hackles of superior performance and color.', u'Synthetics have allowed fly tyers to replicate rare and sometimes endangered furs and feathers as well as create completely new types of flies.', u"Synthetics such as rubber legs, plastic wings and transparent plastic cords, chenilles, and all sorts and colors of flashy materials that can be incorporated into the wings and bodies of today's artificial fly are available to the 21st-century fly tyer.", u"Whereas lead wire was the traditional method of weighting flies, today's weighting materials include glass, brass and tungsten beads and cones as well as lead.", u'Silicone, epoxy, kevlar thread and other modern materials are regularly incorporated in artificial fly patterns.', u'=== Hooks ===\nThe hook determines the basic size and shape of each fly and is generally an important part of any fly pattern description.', u'Hooks come in a wide range of size, shape, length and weight, and must be selected to complement the pattern being tied and the method by which it will be fished.', u'Additionally, flies constructed for use in salt water are typically tied on corrosion-resistant hooks.', u'== The fly pattern ==\nThe fly pattern is the recipe for any particularly named fly.', u'In older literature, especially prior to the 20th century, fly patterns were referred to as dressings.', u'The pattern specifies the size range and type of hook to be used, materials including type, color and size, and in some cases specific instructions to achieve a particular effect or configuration.', u'Fly patterns allow tyers to consistently reproduce any given fly over time.', u'A Light Cahill dry fly produced by one tyer will look remarkably similar to the same fly produced by a completely different tyer if the pattern is followed with reasonable accuracy and with comparable materials.', u'Patterns may also lay out alternatives for different materials and variations.', u'Fly patterns are usually found in fly-fishing and fly-tying literature and periodicals, including online sources.', u'Although fly patterns do provide some consistency, different writers may publish patterns with small to moderate differences across pattern descriptions for the same fly.', u'In many cases, greatest differences are in the tying technique rather than in the form, color or materials.', u'Fly patterns may or may not have an image or drawing of the finished fly to guide the tyer.', u'Historically, fly patterns have been included in texts that discuss fishing with a particular genre of fly, fly-fishing technique or fly-fishing for specific species or genre of gamefish.', u'There are, however, texts that are pure fly pattern and tying references with little or no instruction on how to fish them.', u'=== Parts of an artificial fly ===\nSalmon flies have historically been the most complex and gaudy of artificial flies.', u'Texts describing fly tying techniques often use an image of a salmon fly to describe all the parts of an artificial fly.', u'The parts described below are typical.', u'=== Fly names ===\nThere is no convention or consistency in the naming of artificial flies.', u'Long-standing popular patterns have names that have persisted over time.', u'However, fly designers and amateur or professional fly tyers are free to create any fly they choose and to give it any name they want.', u'Angling writers, the popular angling press, and professional fly tackle dealers have always introduced new patterns with new names.', u'The only naming convention is that there is no convention.', u"Flies have been named to honor or celebrate fellow anglers: Royal Wulff, Jock Scott, Quill Gordon, Adams; named to describe their color and composition: Ginger Quill, Gold-ribbed Hare's Ear, Partridge and Orange; named to reflect some regional origin: Bow River Bugger, Tellico nymph, San Juan worm; named to reflect the prey they represent: Golden stone, Blue-wing Olive, Pale Morning Dun, Elk Hair Caddis, White swimming shrimp; named to reflect nothing in particular: Woolly Bugger, Crazy Charlie, Club Sandwich; and, more often than not, named to evoke the designer: Copper John nymph (John Barr), Clouser Deep Minnow (Bob Clouser), Brooks' Montana stone (Charles Brooks), Parks' Salmonfly (Merton Parks), Carey Special (Colonel Carey), Dahlberg Diver (Larry Dahlberg) or Dave's Hopper (Dave Whitlock).", u'The following is an example of how flies get their names and how those names evolve over time.', u"The Coachman\n\nMost famous of all trout flies is the Coachman, originated by Tom Bosworth, who drove Queen Victoria's coach\n\nThe Royal Coachman\n\nThe Royal Coachman was first made by John Haily a professional fly dresser living in New York City.", u'In writing of other matters, he enclosed this fly for us to see, saying "A gentleman wanted me to tie up some Coachman for him to take to the north woods and to make them extra strong, so I have tied them with a little band of silk in the middle to prevent the peacock bodies from fraying out.', u'I have also added a tail of the barred feathers of the wood-duck, and I think it makes a very handsome fly."', u'A few evenings later, a circle of us were together "disputing the fly in question", one of the party claiming that numbers were "quite as suitable to designate the flies as so many nonsensical names".', u'The others did not agree with him, but he said: "What can you do?', u'Here is a fly intended to be a Coachman; but it is not the true Coachman; it is quite unlike it and what can you call it?"', u'Mr. L. C. Orvis, brother of Mr. Charles Orvis, who was present said: "Oh that is easy enough; call it the Royal Coachman it is so finely dressed!"', u'And this name in time came to be known and used by all who are familiar with the fly.', u'The Royal Wulff\n\nI will be forever indebted to Dan [Dan Bailey] for his companionship and inspiration.', u'Indebted, too, because it was Dan who insisted on giving my name to the Wulff Series and gave me stature I might never have had otherwise.', u"We were fishing together on the Esopus in the spring of 1930 when I was trying out some new flies I'd designed in revolt to the then available Catskill patterns.", u'The new flies had bucktail wings and tails for better floatation.', u'I had planned to call one of them the Bucktail Coachman.', u'It was Dan who insisted that I call them Wulffs and he started tying them under that name\u2014 Lee Wulff in the tribute in Mist on the River-Remembrances of Dan Bailey.', u'=== Typical fly patterns or dressing descriptions ===\nThe typical fly pattern appears something like one of the illustrative patterns below for the Adams dry fly (without tying instructions) or the Clouser Deep Minnow (with tying instructions).', u'Based on the fly pattern, a knowledgeable fly tyer can reproduce the fly with the materials specified.', u'=== Fly pattern types ===\nHistorically, fly pattern types have evolved along with fly fishing itself and today there are generally recognized pattern types.', u'However, none are absolute, as there is much crossover in patterns and pattern types.', u'Typically the fly tyer will encounter patterns classified as Dry Flies, Wet Flies, Soft Hackles, Emergers, Nymphs, Terrestrials, Bucktails and Streamers, Salmon (Atlantic) Flies, Steelhead and Salmon (Pacific) Flies, Bass Flies and Bugs, Poppers, Panfish Flies, Saltwater Flies, or Pike Flies.', u'Even within these categories, there can be many sub-categories of imitative and non-imitative flies.', u'== Further reading ==\n\nRonalds, Alfred (1836).', u"The Fly-Fisher's Entomology.", u'London: Longman, Orme, Brown, Green and Longmans.', u'Blacker, William (1855).', u"Blacker's Art of Fly Making.", u'London: Geo Nichols.', u'Halford, F.

one son, Dhani.', u'Harrison died in 2001, aged 58, from lung cancer.', u'He was cremated and his ashes were scattered in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers in India, in a private ceremony according to Hindu tradition.', u'He left an estate of almost \xa3100 million.', u'== Early years: 1943\u201357 ==\n\nBorn in Liverpool, England, on 25 February 1943, Harrison was the youngest of four children of Harold Hargreaves Harrison and his wife Louise (n\xe9e French).', u'He had one sister, Louise, and two brothers, Harry and Peter.', u"His mother was a shop assistant from a Catholic family with Irish roots, and his father was a bus conductor who had worked as a ship's steward on the White Star Line.", u'His future wife, the model Pattie Boyd, described Harrison\'s parents as "quite short and very Liverpudlian".', u'According to Boyd, Harrison\'s mother was particularly supportive: "All she wanted for her children is that they should be happy, and she recognized that nothing made George quite as happy as making music."', u"An enthusiastic music fan, she was known among friends for her loud singing voice, which at times startled visitors by rattling the Harrisons' windows.", u'While pregnant with George, she often listened to the weekly broadcast Radio India.', u'Harrison\'s biographer Joshua Greene wrote, "Every Sunday she tuned in to mystical sounds evoked by sitars and tablas, hoping that the exotic music would bring peace and calm to the baby in the womb."', u'Harrison was born and lived the first six years of his life at 12 Arnold Grove, Wavertree, Liverpool, a terraced house in a dead end street.', u'The home had an outdoor toilet and its only heat came from a single coal fire.', u'In 1949 the family were offered a council house and moved to 25 Upton Green, Speke.', u'In 1948, at the age of five, Harrison enrolled at Dovedale Primary School.', u'He passed the eleven-plus exam and attended Liverpool Institute High School for Boys from 1954 to 1959.', u'Though the institute did offer a music course, Harrison was disappointed with the absence of guitars, and felt the school "moulded [students] into being frightened".', u"Harrison's earliest musical influences included George Formby, Cab Calloway, Django Reinhardt and Hoagy Carmichael; by the 1950s, Carl Perkins and Lonnie Donegan were significant influences.", u'In early 1956 he had an epiphany: while riding his bicycle, he heard Elvis Presley\'s "Heartbreak Hotel" playing from a nearby house, and the song piqued his interest in rock and roll.', u'He often sat at the back of the class drawing guitars in his schoolbooks, and later commented, "I was totally into guitars."', u'Harrison cited Slim Whitman as another early influence: "The first person I ever saw playing a guitar was Slim Whitman, either a photo of him in a magazine or live on television.', u'Guitars were definitely coming in."', u"Although apprehensive about his son's interest in pursuing a music career, in late 1956 Harrison's father bought him a Dutch Egmond flat top acoustic guitar.", u'A friend of his father\'s taught Harrison how to play "Whispering", "Sweet Sue" and "Dinah", and, inspired by Donegan\'s music, Harrison formed a skiffle group called the Rebels with his brother Peter and a friend, Arthur Kelly.', u'On the bus to school Harrison met Paul McCartney, and the pair bonded over their shared love of music.', u'== The Beatles: 1958\u201370 ==\n\nHarrison became part of the Beatles when they were still a skiffle group called the Quarrymen, with McCartney and John Lennon as members.', u'McCartney told Lennon about his friend George Harrison, who could play "Raunchy" on his guitar.', u'In March 1958, Harrison auditioned for the Quarrymen at Rory Storm\'s Morgue Skiffle Club, playing Arthur "Guitar Boogie" Smith\'s "Guitar Boogie Shuffle", but Lennon felt that Harrison, having just turned 15, was too young to join the band.', u'During a second meeting, arranged by McCartney, he performed the lead guitar part for the instrumental "Raunchy" on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus.', u'He began socialising with the group, filling in on guitar as needed, and became accepted as a member.', u'Although his father wanted him to continue his education, Harrison left school at 16 and worked for several months as an apprentice electrician at Blacklers, a local department store.', u'During the group\'s first tour of Scotland, in 1960, Harrison used the pseudonym "Carl Harrison", in reference to Carl Perkins.', u'In 1960, promoter Allan Williams arranged for the band, now calling themselves the Beatles, to play at the Kaiserkeller club in Hamburg owned by Bruno Koschmider.', u'The impromptu musical education Harrison received while playing long hours with the Beatles, as well as the guitar lessons he took from Tony Sheridan while they briefly served as his backing group, laid the foundations of his sound and of his quiet, professional role within the group; he was later known as "the quiet Beatle".', u"The band's first residency in Hamburg ended prematurely when Harrison was deported for being too young to work in nightclubs.", u'When Brian Epstein became their manager in December 1961, he polished their image and secured them a recording contract with EMI.', u'The group\'s first single, "Love Me Do", peaked at number seventeen on the Record Retailer chart, and by the time their debut album, Please Please Me, was released in early 1963, Beatlemania had arrived.', u'Their second album, With the Beatles (1963), included "Don\'t Bother Me", Harrison\'s first solo writing credit.', u'By 1965\'s Rubber Soul, Harrison had begun to lead the other Beatles into folk rock through his interest in the Byrds and Bob Dylan, and towards Indian classical music through his use of the sitar on "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)".', u'He later called Rubber Soul his "favourite [Beatles] album".', u'Revolver (1966) included three of his compositions: "Taxman", "Love You To" and "I Want to Tell You".', u'His introduction of the drone-like tambura part on Lennon\'s "Tomorrow Never Knows" exemplified the band\'s ongoing exploration of non-Western instruments.', u'The tabla-driven "Love You To" was the Beatles\' first genuine foray into Indian music.', u'According to the ethnomusicologist David Reck, the song set a precedent in popular music as an example of Asian culture being represented by Westerners respectfully and without parody.', u'Harrison continued to develop his interest in non-Western instrumentation, playing swarmandal on "Strawberry Fields Forever".', u"By late 1966 Harrison's interests had moved away from the Beatles, as reflected in his choice of Eastern gurus and religious leaders for inclusion on the album cover for Sgt.", u"Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in 1967.", u'His sole composition on the album was the Indian-inspired "Within You Without You", to which no other Beatle contributed.', u'He played sitar and tambura on the track, backed by musicians from the London Asian Music Circle on dilruba, swarmandal and tabla.', u'He later commented on the Sgt.', u'Pepper album: "It was a millstone and a milestone in the music industry ...', u'There\'s about half the songs I like and the other half I can\'t stand."', u'In 1968 his song "The Inner Light" was recorded at EMI\'s studio in Bombay, featuring a group of local musicians playing traditional Indian instruments.', u'Released as the B-side to McCartney\'s "Lady Madonna", it was the first Harrison composition to appear on a Beatles single.', u"Derived from a quotation from the Tao Te Ching, the song's lyric reflected Harrison's deepening interest in Hinduism and meditation, while musically it embraced the Karnatak discipline of Indian music, rather than the Hindustani style of his previous work in the genre.", u'During the recording of The Beatles that same year, tensions within the group ran high, and drummer Ringo Starr quit briefly.', u'Harrison\'s songwriting contributions to the double album included "While My Guitar Gently Weeps", which featured Eric Clapton on lead guitar, "Piggies", "Long, Long, Long" and "Savoy Truffle".', u'Dylan and the Band were a major musical influence on Harrison at the end of his career with the Beatles.', u"While on a visit to Woodstock in late 1968, he established a friendship with Dylan and found himself drawn to the Band's sense of communal music-making and to the creative equality among the band members, which contrasted with Lennon and McCartney's domination of the Beatles' songwriting and creative direction.", u'This coincided with a prolific period in his songwriting and a growing desire to assert his independence from the Beatles, tensions among whom surfaced again in January 1969, during the filming of rehearsals at Twickenham Studios for what became the album Let It Be.', u"Frustrated by the poor working conditions in the cold and sterile film studio, as well as by what he perceived as Lennon's creative disengagement from the Beatles and a domineering attitude from McCartney, Harrison quit the group on 10 January, but agreed to return twelve days later.", u'Relations among the Beatles were more cordial, though still strained, during sessions for their final recorded album, Abbey Road.', u'The LP included two of Harrison\'s most respected Beatles compositions: "Here Comes the Sun" and "Something", which became one half of the Beatles\' first number one double A-side single, Harrison\'s first A-side, and the first Harrison song to reach the top of the charts.', u'In 1969 Frank Sinatra recorded "Something", and later dubbed it "the greatest love song of the past fifty years".', u'Lennon considered it the best song on Abbey Road, and it became the Beatles\' second most covered song after "Yesterday".', u'Author Peter Lavezzoli wrote: "Harrison would finally achieve equal songwriting status ... with his two classic contributions to the final Beatles\' LP".', u'In April 1970 when Harrison\'s "For You Blue" was released in America as a double A-side with McCartney\'s "The Long and Winding Road", it became the band\'s second chart-topping double A-side and "For You Blue" became Harrison\'s second number one hit.', u"His increased productivity and the Beatles' reluctance to include his songs on their albums meant that by the time of their break-up he had amassed a stockpile of unreleased compositions.", u"While Harrison grew as a songwriter, his compositional presence on Beatles albums remained limited to two or three songs, increasing his frustration, and significantly contributing to the band's break-up.", u'Harrison\'s last recording session with the Beatles was on 4 January 1970, when he, McCartney and Starr recorded the Harrison song "I Me Mine".', u"== Solo career: 1968\u201387 ==\n\n\n=== Early solo work: 1968\u201369 ===\nBefore the Beatles' break-up, Harrison had already recorded and released two solo albums: Wonderwall Music and Electronic Sound, both of which contain mainly instrumental compositions.", u'Wonderwall Music, a soundtrack to the 1968 film Wonderwall, blends Indian and Western instrumentation, while Electronic Sound is an experimental album that prominently features a Moog synthesizer.', u'Released in November 1968, Wonderwall Music was the first solo album by a Beatle and the first LP released by Apple Records.', u'Indian musicians Aashish Khan and Shivkumar Sharma performed on the album, which contains the experimental sound collage "Dream Scene", recorded several months before Lennon\'s "Revolution 9".', u'In December 1969, Harrison participated in a brief tour of Europe with the American group Delaney & Bonnie and Friends.', u'During the tour that included Clapton, Bobby Whitlock, drummer Jim Gordon and band leaders Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett, Harrison began to write "My Sweet Lord", which became his first single as a solo artist.', u'Delaney Bramlett inspired Harrison to learn slide guitar, significantly influencing his later music.', u"=== All Things Must Pass: 1970 ===\n\nAfter years of being restricted in his songwriting contributions to the Beatles' albums, Harrison released All Things Must Pass, a triple album, with two discs of his songs and the third of recordings of Harrison jamming with friends.", u'Regarded by many as his best work, the album topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic.', u'The LP produced the number-one hit single "My Sweet Lord" and the top-ten single "What Is Life".', u'The album was co-produced by Phil Spector using his "Wall of Sound" approach, and the musicians included Starr, Clapton, Gary Wright, Preston, Klaus Voormann, the whole of Delaney and Bonnie\'s Friends band and the Apple group Badfinger.', u'On release, All Things Must Pass was received with critical acclaim; Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone described it as being "of classic Spectorian proportions, Wagnerian, Brucknerian, the music of mountain tops and vast horizons".', u'Author and musicologist Ian Inglis considers the lyrics of the album\'s title track "a recognition of the impermanence of human existence ... a simple and poignant conclusion" to Harrison\'s former band.', u'In 1971 Bright Tunes sued Harrison for copyright infringement over "My Sweet Lord" owing to its similarity to the 1963 Chiffons hit "He\'s So Fine".', u'When the case was heard in the United States district court in 1976, he denied deliberately plagiarising the song, but lost the case as the judge ruled that he had done so subconsciously.', u'In 2000 Apple Records released a thirtieth anniversary edition of the album and Harrison actively participated in its promotion, giving an interview during which he reflected on the work: "It\'s just something that was like my continuation from the Beatles, really.', u'It was me sort of getting out of the Beatles and just going my own way ... it was a very happy occasion."', u'He commented on the production: "Well, in those days it was like the reverb was kind of used a bit more than what I would do now.', u"In fact, I don't use reverb at all.", u'I can\'t stand it ... You know, it\'s hard to go back to anything thirty years later and expect it to be how you would want it now."', u"=== The Concert for Bangladesh: 1971 ===\n\nResponding to a request from Ravi Shankar, Harrison organised a charity event, the Concert for Bangladesh, which took place on 1 August 1971, drawing over 40,000 people to two shows in New York's Madison Square Garden.", u'The goal of the event was to raise money to aid starving refugees during the Bangladesh Liberation War.', u'Shankar opened the show, which featured popular musicians such as Dylan, Clapton, Leon Russell, Badfinger, Preston and Starr.', u'A triple album, The Concert for Bangladesh, was released by Apple Corps that year, followed by a concert film in 1972.', u'Tax troubles and questionable expenses later tied up many of the proceeds, but Harrison commented: "Mainly the concert was to attract attention to the situation ...', u'The money we raised was secondary, and although we had some money problems ... they still got plenty ... even though it was a drop in the ocean.', u'The main thing was, we spread the word and helped get the war ended."', u'The event has been described as an innovative precursor for the large-scale charity rock shows that followed, including Live Aid.', u'=== Living in the Material World to George Harrison: 1973\u201379 ===\nHarrison would not again release an album that matched the critical and commercial achievements of All Things Must Pass; however, his next solo album, 1973\'s Living in the Material World, held the number one spot on the Billboard album chart for five weeks, and the album\'s single, "Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)", also reached number one in the US.', u'In the UK, the LP achieved number two, spending 12 weeks on the charts with the single peaking at number 8.', u"The album was lavishly produced and packaged, and its dominant message was Harrison's Hindu beliefs.", u'In Greene\'s opinion it "contained many of the strongest compositions of his career".', u'Stephen Holden, writing in Rolling Stone, felt the album was "vastly appealing" and "profoundly seductive", and that it stood "alone as an article of faith, miraculous in its radiance."', u'Other reviewers were less enthusiastic, describing the release as awkward, sanctimonious and overly sentimental, a reaction that left Harrison despondent.', u'In November 1974 Harrison began his 45-date Dark Horse Tour, becoming the first ex-Beatle to tour North America.', u'In addition to performances by Harrison with an ensemble of musicians such as Preston, Tom Scott, Willie Weeks, Andy Newmark and Jim Horn, the tour also included traditional and contemporary Indian music performed by "Ravi Shankar, Family and Friends".', u"Despite numerous positive reviews the consensus reaction to the tour was negative, with complaints about the content, structure, and length; the show's duration of two and a half hours was seen as excessive at the time.", u'Some fans found Shankar\'s significant presence a bizarre disappointment, having expected to see only Harrison perform, and many were affronted by what Inglis described as Harrison\'s "sermonizing".', u'Further, he reworked the lyrics to several Beatles songs, and some of the substitutions were seen as "gratuitously offensive".', u'His laryngitis-affected vocals also disappointed fans and critics, who began calling the tour "dark hoarse".', u'Harrison was so deeply bothered by the caustic backlash that he did not tour again until the 1990s.', u'The author Robert Rodriguez commented: "While the Dark Horse tour might be considered a noble failure, there were a number of fans who were tuned-in to what was being attempted.', u'They went away ecstatic, conscious that they had just witnessed something so uplifting that it could never be repeated."', u'Leng called the tour "groundbreaking" and "revolutionary in its presentation of Indian Music".', u'In December Harrison released Dark Horse, an album that earned him the least favourable reviews of his career.', u'Rolling Stone called it "the chronicle of a performer out of his element, working to a deadline, enfeebling his overtaxed talents by a rush to deliver a new \'LP product\', rehearse a band, and assemble a cross-country tour, all within three weeks".', u'The album reached number 4 on the Billboard chart and the single "Dark Horse" reached number 15, but they failed to make an impact in the UK.', u'The music critic Mikal Gilmore described Dark Horse as "one of Harrison\'s most fascinating works \u2013 a record about change and loss".', u"Harrison's final studio album for EMI and Apple Records was the soul music-inspired Extra Texture (Read All About It) (1975).", u'He considered it the least satisfactory of the three he had recorded since All Things Must Pass.', u'Leng identified "bitterness and dismay" in many of the album\'s tracks; his long-time friend Klaus Voormann commented: "He wasn\'t up for it ...', u"It was a terrible time because I think there was a lot of cocaine going around, and that's when I got out of the picture ...", u'I didn\'t like his frame of mind".', u'He released two singles from the LP: "You", which reached the Billboard top 20, and "This Guitar (Can\'t Keep from Crying)", Apple\'s final original single release.', u'Thirty Three & 1/3 (1976), Harrison\'s first album release on his own Dark Horse Records label, produced the hit singles "This Song" and "Crackerbox Palace", both of which reached the top 25 in the US.', u'The surreal humour of "Crackerbox Palace" reflected Harrison\'s association with Monty Python\'s Eric Idle, who directed a comical music video for the song.', u'With an emphasis on melody and musicianship, and a more subtle subject matter than the pious message of his earlier works, Thirty Three & 1/3 earned Harrison his most favourable critical notices in the US since All Things Must Pass.', u'In 1979, following his second marriage and the birth of his son Dhani, he released George Harrison.', u'The album and the single "Blow Away" both made the Billboard top 20.', u"The album marked the beginning of Harrison's gradual retreat from the music business, and the fruition of ideas introduced on All Things Must Pass.", u'In 1978 the death of his father in May and the birth of his son in August had influenced his decision to devote more time to his family than to his career.', u'Leng described the album as "melodic and lush ... peaceful ... the work of a man who had lived the rock and roll dream twice over and was now embracing domestic as well as spiritual bliss".', u'=== Somewhere in England to Cloud Nine: 1980\u201387 ===\n\nThe murder of Lennon on 8 December 1980 disturbed Harrison and reinforced his decades-long concerns about stalkers.', u'It was also a deep personal loss, although unlike McCartney and Starr, Harrison had had little contact with Lennon in the years before his death.', u'Following the murder, Harrison commented: "After all we went through together I had and still have great love and respect for John Lennon.', u'I am shocked and stunned."', u'Harrison modified the lyrics of a song he had written for Starr to make it a tribute song to Lennon.', u'"All Those Years Ago", which included vocal contributions from Paul and Linda McCartney, as well as Starr\'s original drum part, peaked at number two in the US charts.', u'The single was included on the album Somewhere in England in 1981.', u"Harrison did not release any new albums for five years after 1982's Gone Troppo received little notice from critics or the public.", u'During this period he made several guest appearances, including a 1985 performance at a tribute to Carl Perkins titled Blue Suede Shoes: A Rockabilly Session.', u"In March 1986 he made a surprise appearance during the finale of the Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert, an event organised to raise money for the Birmingham Children's Hospital.", u'The following year, he appeared at The Prince\'s Trust concert at London\'s Wembley Arena, performing "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" and "Here Comes the Sun".', u'In February 1987 he joined Dylan, John Fogerty and Jesse Ed Davis on stage for a two-hour performance with the blues musician Taj Mahal.', u'Harrison recalled: "Bob rang me up and asked if I wanted to come out for the evening and see Taj Mahal ...', u"So we went there and had a few of these Mexican beers \u2013 and had a few more ... Bob says, 'Hey, why don't we all get up and play, and you can sing?'", u'But every time I got near the microphone, Dylan comes up and just starts singing this rubbish in my ear, trying to throw me."', u'In November 1987 Harrison released the platinum album Cloud Nine.', u'Co-produced with Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra, the LP included Harrison\'s rendition of James Ray\'s "Got My Mind Set on You", which went to number one in the US and number two in the UK.', u'The accompanying music video received substantial airplay, and another single, "When We Was Fab", a retrospective of the Beatles\' career, earned two MTV Music Video Awards nominations in 1988.', u'Recorded at his estate in Friar Park, Harrison\'s slide guitar playing featured prominently on the album, which included several of his long-time musical collaborators, including Clapton, Jim Keltner, and Jim Horn, who recalled Harrison\'s relaxed and friendly demeanour during the sessions: "George made you feel at home, in his home ...', u'He once had me sit on a toilet and play my soprano sax, and they miked it at the end of the hall for a distant sound.', u'I thought they were kidding ... Another time he stopped me in the middle of a sax solo and brought me 3 p.m. tea\u2014again I thought he was kidding."', u'Cloud Nine reached number eight and number ten on the US and UK charts respectively, and several tracks from the album achieved placement on Billboard\'s Mainstream Rock chart \u2013 "Devil\'s Radio", "This Is Love" and "Cloud 9".', u'== Later career: 1988\u201396 ==\n\n\n=== The Traveling Wilburys: 1988\u20131990 ===\n\nIn 1988 Harrison formed the Traveling Wilburys with Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, Bob Dylan and Tom Petty.', u"The band had gathered in Dylan's garage to record a song for a Harrison European single release.", u'Harrison\'s record company decided the track, "Handle with Care", was too good for its original purpose as a B-side and asked for a full album.', u'The LP, Traveling Wilburys Vol.', u'1, was released in October 1988 and recorded under pseudonyms as half-brothers, supposed sons of Charles Truscott Wilbury, Sr. Harrison\'s pseudonym on the first album was "Nelson Wilbury"; he used the name "Spike Wilbury" for their second album.', u"After Orbison's death in December 1988 the group recorded as a four-piece.", u'Their second release, issued in October 1990, was mischievously titled Traveling Wilburys Vol.', u'3.', u'According to Lynne, "That was George\'s idea.', u'He said, \'Let\'s confuse the buggers.\'"', u'It reached number 14 in the UK, where it went platinum with certified sales of more than 3,000,000 units.', u'The Wilburys never performed live and the group did not record together again following the release of their second album.', u'In 1989 Harrison and Starr appeared in the music video for Tom Petty\'s song "I Won\'t Back Down".', u'Starr is filmed playing the drums, but did not play on the track; Harrison played acoustic guitar and provided backing vocals.', u'In December 1991, Harrison joined Clapton for a tour of Japan.', u"It was Harrison's first since 1974 and no others followed.", u"On 6 April 1992, Harrison held a benefit concert for the Natural Law Party at the Royal Albert Hall, his first London performance since the Beatles' 1969 rooftop concert.", u'In October 1992 he performed at a Bob Dylan tribute concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City, playing alongside Dylan, Clapton, McGuinn, Petty and Neil Young.', u'=== The Beatles Anthology: 1995\u201396 ===\n\nIn 1994 Harrison began a collaboration with McCartney, Starr and producer Jeff Lynne for the Beatles Anthology project.', u"This included the recording of two new Beatles songs built around solo vocal and piano tapes recorded by Lennon as well as lengthy interviews about the Beatles' career.", u'Released in December 1995, "Free as a Bird" was the first new Beatles single since 1970.', u'In March 1996,

song "Your True Love".', u"In June 1998, he attended the public memorial service for Linda McCartney, and appeared on Starr's album Vertical Man, playing guitar on two tracks.", u'== Later life and death: 1997\u20132001 ==\nIn 1997, Harrison was diagnosed with throat cancer and treated with radiotherapy, which was thought at the time to be successful.', u'He publicly blamed years of smoking for the illness.', u'On 30 December 1999, Harrison and his wife were attacked at their home, Friar Park.', u'Michael Abram, a 36-year-old fan, broke in and attacked Harrison with a kitchen knife, puncturing a lung and causing head injuries before Olivia Harrison incapacitated the assailant by striking him repeatedly with a fireplace poker and a lamp.', u'Following the attack, Harrison was hospitalised with more than 40 stab wounds.', u'He released a statement soon afterwards regarding his assailant: "[he] wasn\'t a burglar, and he certainly wasn\'t auditioning for the Traveling Wilburys."', u'In May 2001, it was revealed that Harrison had undergone an operation to remove a cancerous growth from one of his lungs, and in July, it was reported that he was being treated for a brain tumour at a clinic in Switzerland.', u'While in Switzerland, Starr visited him but had to cut his stay short to travel to Boston, where his daughter was undergoing emergency brain surgery, prompting Harrison to quip: "Do you want me to come with you?"', u'In November 2001, he began radiotherapy at Staten Island University Hospital, in New York City, for non-small cell lung cancer that had spread to his brain.', u"When the news was publicised, Harrison bemoaned his physician's breach of privacy, and his estate later claimed damages.", u'On 12 November, in New York, Harrison, Starr

Bother Me", while sick in a hotel bed in Bournemouth during August 1963, as "an exercise to see if I could write a song", as he remembered.', u'"Don\'t Bother Me" appeared on the band\'s second album, With the Beatles, later that year, then on Meet the Beatles!', u'in the US in early 1964.', u'In 1965, he contributed "I Need You" and "You Like Me Too Much" to the album Help!', u"Harrison's songwriting ability improved throughout the Beatles' career, but his material did not earn full respect from Lennon, McCartney and producer George Martin until near the group's break-up.", u'In 1969, McCartney told Lennon: "Until this year, our songs have been better than George\'s.', u'Now this year his songs are at least as good as ours".', u'Harrison often had difficulty getting the band to record his songs.', u'Most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contain at least two Harrison compositions; three of his songs appear on Revolver, "the album on which Harrison came of age as a songwriter", according to Inglis.', u'Of the 1967 Harrison song "Within You Without You", author Gerry Farrell claimed that Harrison had created a "new form", calling the composition "a quintessential fusion of pop and Indian music".', u'Lennon called the song one of Harrison\'s best: "His mind and his music are clear.', u'There is his innate talent, he brought that sound together."', u'Beatles biographer Bob Spitz described "Something" as a masterpiece, and "an intensely stirring romantic ballad that would challenge \'Yesterday\' and \'Michelle\' as one of the most recognizable songs they ever produced".', u'According to Kenneth Womack, "Harrison comes into his own on Abbey Road ... \'Here Comes the Sun\' is matched \u2013 indeed, surpassed \u2013 only by \'Something\', his crowning achievement".', u"Inglis considered Abbey Road a turning point in Harrison's development as a songwriter and musician.", u'He described Harrison\'s contributions to the LP as "exquisite", declaring them equal to any previous Beatles songs.', u"During the album's recording, Harrison asserted more creative control than before, proactively rejecting suggestions for changes to his music or lyrics, particularly from McCartney.", u'His interest in Indian music proved a strong influence on his songwriting and contributed to his innovation within the Beatles.', u'According to Mikal Gilmore of Rolling Stone, "Harrison\'s openness to new sounds and textures cleared new paths for his rock and roll compositions.', u'His use of dissonance on ... \'Taxman\' and \'I Want to Tell You\' was revolutionary in popular music \u2013 and perhaps more originally creative than the avant-garde mannerisms that Lennon and McCartney borrowed from the music of Karlheinz Stockhausen, Luciano Berio, Edgard Var\xe8se and Igor Stravinsky ..." In 1997, Gerry Farrell commented: "It is a mark of Harrison\'s sincere involvement ... that, nearly thirty years on, the Beatles\' \'Indian\' songs remain the most imaginative and successful examples of this type of fusion."', u'=== Guitar work ===\n\nHarrison\'s guitar work with the Beatles was varied and flexible; although not fast or flashy, his lead guitar playing was solid and typified the more subdued lead guitar style of the early 1960s; his rhythm guitar playing was as innovative, such as using a capo to shorten the strings on an acoustic guitar, as on the Rubber Soul album and "Here Comes the Sun", to create a bright, sweet sound.', u'Eric Clapton felt that Harrison was "clearly an innovator" as he was "taking certain elements of R&B and rock and rockabilly and creating something unique".', u'Rolling Stone founder Jann Wenner described Harrison as "a guitarist who was never showy but who had an innate, eloquent melodic sense.', u'He played exquisitely in the service of the song".', u'Harrison\'s friend and former bandmate Tom Petty agreed: "He just had a way of getting right to the business, of finding the right thing to play."', u"The guitar picking style of Chet Atkins and Carl Perkins influenced Harrison, giving a country music feel to many of the Beatles' recordings.", u'He identified Chuck Berry as an early influence and Ry Cooder as an important later influence.', u'In 1961 the Beatles recorded "Cry for a Shadow", a blues-inspired instrumental co-written by Lennon and Harrison, who is credited with composing the song\'s lead guitar part, building on unusual chord voicings and imitating the style of other English groups such as the Shadows.', u'The musicologist Walter Everett noted that while early Beatles compositions typically held close to the conventional patterns in rock music at the time, he also identified significant variations in their rhythm and tonal direction.', u"Harrison's liberal use of the diatonic scale in his guitar playing reveals the influence of Buddy Holly, and his interest in Berry inspired him to compose songs based on the blues scale while incorporating a rockabilly feel in the style of Perkins.", u'Within this framework he often utilised syncopation, as during his guitar solos for the Beatles\' covers of Berry\'s "Roll Over Beethoven" and "Too Much Monkey Business".', u'Another of Harrison\'s musical techniques was the use of guitar lines written in octaves, as on "I\'ll Be on My Way".', u'He was the first person to own a Rickenbacker 360/12, a guitar with twelve strings, the low eight of which are tuned in pairs, one octave apart; the higher four being pairs tuned in unison.', u'The Rickenbacker is unique among twelve-string guitars in having the lower octave string of each of the first four pairs placed above the higher tuned string.', u"This, and the naturally rich harmonics produced by a twelve-string guitar provided the distinctive overtones found on many of the Beatles' recordings.", u'His use of this guitar during the recording of A Hard Day\'s Night helped to popularise the model, and the jangly sound became so prominent that Melody Maker termed it the Beatles\' "secret weapon".', u'Harrison wrote the chord progression of his first published song, "Don\'t Bother Me" (1963), almost exclusively in the Dorian mode, demonstrating an interest in exotic tones that eventually culminated in his embrace of Indian music.', u'The dark timbre of his guitar playing on the track was accentuated by his use of uncomplicated yet effective C+9 chord voicings and a solo in the minor pentatonic scale.', u'By 1964 he had begun to develop a distinctive personal style as a guitarist, writing parts that featured the use of nonresolving tones, as with the ending chord arpeggios on "A Hard Day\'s Night".', u'In 1965 he used an expression pedal to control his guitar\'s volume on "I Need You", creating a syncopated flautando effect with the melody resolving its dissonance through tonal displacements.', u'He used the same volume-swell technique on "Yes It Is", applying what Everett described as "ghostly articulation" to the song\'s natural harmonics.', u'Of Rubber Soul\'s "If I Needed Someone", Harrison said: "it\'s like a million other songs written around the D chord.', u'If you move your fingers about, you get various little melodies ... it amazes me that people still find new permutations of the same notes."', u'His other contribution to the album, "Think for Yourself", features what Everett described as "ambiguous tonal coloring", utilising chromaticism in G major with a "strange" mixture of the Dorian mode and the minor pentatonic; he called it a "tour de force of altered scale degrees".', u'In 1966 Harrison contributed innovative musical ideas to Revolver.', u'He played backwards guitar on Lennon\'s composition "I\'m Only Sleeping" and a guitar counter-melody on "And Your Bird Can Sing" that moved in parallel octaves above McCartney\'s bass downbeats.', u'His guitar playing on "I Want to Tell You" exemplified the pairing of altered chordal colours with descending chromatic lines and his guitar part for Sgt Pepper\'s "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" mirrors Lennon\'s vocal line in much the same way that a sarangi player accompanies a khyal singer in a Hindu devotional song.', u'Everett described Harrison\'s guitar solo from "Old Brown Shoe" as "stinging [and] highly Claptonesque".', u'He identified two of the composition\'s significant motifs: a bluesy trichord and a diminished triad with roots in A and E. Huntley called the song "a sizzling rocker with a ferocious ... solo".', u'In Greene\'s opinion, Harrison\'s demo for "Old Brown Shoe" contains "one of the most complex lead guitar solos on any Beatles song".', u'Harrison\'s playing on Abbey Road, and in particular on "Something", marked a significant moment in his development as a guitarist.', u"The song's guitar solo shows a varied range of influences, incorporating the blues guitar style of Clapton and the styles of Indian gamakas.", u'According to author and musicologist Kenneth Womack: "\'Something\' meanders toward the most unforgettable of Harrison\'s guitar solos ... A masterpiece in simplicity, [it] reaches toward the sublime".', u'Harrison received an Ivor Novello award in July 1970 for "Something", as "The Best Song Musically and Lyrically of the Year".', u'After Delaney Bramlett inspired him to learn slide guitar, Harrison began to incorporate it into his solo work, which allowed him to mimic many traditional Indian instruments, including the sarangi and the dilruba.', u'Leng described Harrison\'s slide guitar solo on Lennon\'s "How Do You Sleep?"', u'as a departure for "the sweet soloist of \'Something\'", calling his playing "rightly famed ... one of Harrison\'s greatest guitar statements".', u'Lennon commented: "That\'s the best he\'s ever fucking played in his life."', u'A Hawaiian influence is notable in much of Harrison\'s music, ranging from his slide guitar work on Gone Troppo (1982) to his televised performance of the Cab Calloway standard "Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea" on ukulele in 1992.', u'Lavezzoli described Harrison\'s slide playing on the Grammy-winning instrumental "Marwa Blues" (2002) as demonstrating Hawaiian influences while comparing the melody to an Indian sarod or veena, calling it "yet another demonstration of Harrison\'s unique slide approach".', u'Harrison was an admirer of George Formby and a member of the Ukulele Society of Great Britain, and played a ukulele solo in the style of Formby at the end of "Free as a Bird".', u'He performed at a Formby convention in 1991, and served as the honorary president of the George Formby Appreciation Society.', u'Harrison played bass guitar on numerous tracks, including the Beatles songs "She Said She Said", "Golden Slumbers", "Birthday" and "Honey Pie".', u'He also played bass on several solo recordings, including "Faster", "Wake Up My Love" and "Bye Bye Love".', u'=== Guitars ===\nWhen Harrison joined the Quarrymen in 1958 his main guitar was a H\xf6fner President Acoustic, which he soon traded for a H\xf6fner Club 40 model.', u'His first solid-body electric guitar was a Czech-built Jolana Futurama/Grazioso.', u'The guitars he used on early recordings were mainly Gretsch models, played through a Vox amplifier, including a Gretsch Duo Jet that he bought secondhand in 1961, and posed with on the album cover for Cloud Nine (1987).', u'He also bought a Gretsch Tennessean and a Gretsch Country Gentleman, which he played on "She Loves You", and during the Beatles\' 1964 appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show.', u'In 1963 he bought a Rickenbacker 425 Fireglo, and in 1964 he acquired a Rickenbacker 360/12 guitar, which was the second of its kind to be manufactured.', u'Harrison obtained his first Fender Stratocaster in 1965 and used it in recording Rubber Soul, notably on the song "Nowhere Man".', u'In early 1966 Harrison, Lennon, and McCartney each purchased Epiphone Casinos, which they used on Revolver.', u'Harrison also used a Gibson J-160E and a Gibson SG Standard while recording the album.', u'He later painted his Stratocaster in a psychedelic design that included the word "Bebopalula" above the pickguard and the guitar\'s nickname, "Rocky", on the headstock.', u'He played this guitar in the Magical Mystery Tour film and throughout his solo career.', u'In mid-1968 he acquired a Gibson Les Paul that he nicknamed "Lucy".', u'Around this time, he obtained a Gibson Jumbo J-200, which he used for early demos of "While My Guitar Gently Weeps".', u'In late 1968 Fender Musical Instruments Corporation gave Harrison a custom-made Fender Telecaster Rosewood prototype, made especially for him by Philip Kubicki (who years later would start his own business, Factor), a Fender master builder who also crafted a prototype Stratocaster for Jimi Hendrix.', u'=== Collaborations ===\n\nFrom 1968 onward Harrison collaborated with other musicians; he brought in Eric Clapton to play lead guitar on "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" for the 1968 Beatles\' White Album, and collaborated with John Barham on his 1968 debut solo album, Wonderwall Music, which included contributions from Clapton again, as well as Peter Tork from the Monkees.', u'He played on tracks by Dave Mason, Nicky Hopkins, Alvin Lee, Ronnie Wood, Billy Preston and Tom Scott.', u'Harrison co-wrote songs and music with Dylan, Clapton, Preston, Doris Troy, David Bromberg, Gary Wright, Wood, Jeff Lynne, and Tom Petty, among others.', u"Harrison's music projects during the final years of the Beatles included producing Apple Records artists Doris Troy, Jackie Lomax and Billy Preston.", u'Harrison co-wrote the song "Badge" with Clapton, which was included on Cream\'s 1969 album, Goodbye.', u'Harrison played rhythm guitar on the track, using the pseudonym "L\'Angelo Misterioso" for contractual reasons.', u"In May 1970 he played guitar on several songs during a recording session for Dylan's album New Morning.", u'In addition to his own work, between 1971 and 1973 he co-wrote and/or produced three top ten hits for Starr: "It Don\'t Come Easy", "Back Off Boogaloo" and "Photograph".', u'In 1971 he played electric slide guitar on "How Do You Sleep?"', u'and a dobro on "Crippled Inside", both from Lennon\'s Imagine album.', u'Also that year, he produced and played slide guitar on Badfinger\'s top ten hit "Day After Day", and a dobro on Preston\'s "I Wrote a Simple Song".', u'He worked with Harry Nilsson on "You\'re Breakin\' My Heart" (1972) and with Cheech & Chong on "Basketball Jones" (1973).', u'In 1973 he produced and made a guest appearance on the album Shankar Family & Friends.', u'In 1974 Harrison founded Dark Horse Records.', u'In addition to eventually releasing his own albums on the label, he initially used the company as an avenue for collaboration with other musicians.', u'He wanted Dark Horse to serve as a creative outlet for artists, as Apple Records had for the Beatles.', u'Harrison explained: "Most of the stuff will be what I produce".', u'Eric Idle commented: "He\'s extremely generous, and he backs and supports all sorts of people that you\'ll never, ever hear of."', u'The first acts signed to the new label were Ravi Shankar and Splinter, whose album Harrison produced, which provided Dark Horse with their first hit, "Costafine Town".', u'Other artists signed by Dark Horse include Attitudes, Henry McCullough, Jiva, and Stairsteps.', u'Harrison collaborated with Tom Scott on Scott\'s album New York Connection (1976), and in 1981 he played guitar on "Walk a Thin Line", from Mick Fleetwood\'s The Visitor.', u'In 1996 he recorded "Distance Makes No Difference With Love" with Carl Perkins, and played slide guitar on the title track of Dylan\'s Under the Red Sky album.', u'In 2001 he performed as a guest musician on Jeff Lynne and Electric Light Orchestra\'s comeback album Zoom, and on the song "Love Letters" for Bill Wyman\'s Rhythm Kings.', u'He also co-wrote a new song with his son Dhani, "Horse to the Water", which was recorded on 1 October, eight weeks before his death.', u"It appeared on Jools Holland's album Small World, Big Band.", u"=== Sitar and Indian music ===\n\nDuring the Beatles' American tour in August 1965, Harrison's friend David Crosby of the Byrds introduced him to Indian classical music and the work of sitar maestro Ravi Shankar.", u'Harrison described Shankar as "the first person who ever impressed me in my life ... and he was the only person who didn\'t try to impress me."', u'Harrison became fascinated with the sitar and immersed himself in Indian music.', u'According to Lavezzoli, Harrison\'s introduction of the instrument on the Beatles\' song "Norwegian Wood" "opened the floodgates for Indian instrumentation in rock music, triggering what Shankar would call \'The Great Sitar Explosion\' of 1966\u201367".', u'Lavezzoli described Harrison as "the man most responsible for this phenomenon".', u'In June 1966 Harrison met Shankar at the home of Mrs Angadi of the Asian Music Circle, asked to be his student, and was accepted.', u'On 6 July, Harrison travelled to India to buy a sitar from Rikhi Ram & Sons in New Delhi.', u'Lavezzoli described Harrison\'s sitar playing on the Revolver track "Love You To" as an "astonishing improvement" over "Norwegian Wood" and "the most accomplished performance on sitar by any rock musician".', u'In September, he returned to India to study sitar with Shankar.', u'He initially stayed in Bombay, then moved to a houseboat on a remote lake where Shankar taught him for six weeks.', u'After Shankar, he received tutelage from Shambu Das.', u'Harrison studied the instrument until 1968, when an encounter with Clapton and Hendrix at a hotel in New York convinced him to put down the instrument and return to guitar playing.', u'He commented: "I decided ...', u'I should get back to the guitar because I\'m not getting any better at it, and I\'m not going to be a great sitar player ... because I should have started at least fifteen years earlier."', u'== Personal life ==\n\n\n=== Hinduism ===\n\nBy the mid-1960s Harrison had become an admirer of Indian culture and mysticism, introducing it to the other Beatles.', u'During the filming of Help!', u'in the Bahamas, they met the founder of Sivananda Yoga, Swami Vishnu-devananda, who gave each of them a signed copy of his book, The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga.', u'Between the end of the last Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the Sgt Pepper recording sessions, he made a pilgrimage to India with his wife Pattie; there, he studied sitar with Ravi Shankar, met several gurus, and visited various holy places.', u'In 1968 he travelled to Rishikesh in northern India with the other Beatles to study meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.', u"Harrison's use of psychedelic drugs encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism.", u'He commented: "For me, it was like a flash.', u'The first time I had acid, it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me, and I realized a lot of things.', u"I didn't learn them because I already knew them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them.", u'From the moment I had that, I wanted to have it all the time \u2013 these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas, and Ravi\'s music."', u'In line with the Hindu yoga tradition, Harrison became a vegetarian in the late 1960s.', u'After being given various religious texts by Shankar in 1966, he remained a lifelong advocate of the teachings of Swami Vivekananda and Paramahansa Yogananda \u2013 yogis and authors, respectively, of Raja Yoga and Autobiography of a Yogi.', u'In mid-1969, he produced the single "Hare Krishna Mantra", performed by members of the London Radha Krishna Temple.', u'Having also helped the Temple devotees become established in Britain, Harrison then met their leader, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, whom he described as "my friend \u2026 my master" and "a perfect example of everything he preached".', u'Harrison embraced the Hare Krishna tradition, particularly japa-yoga chanting with beads, and became a lifelong devotee.', u'Regarding other faiths he once remarked: "All religions are branches of one big tree.', u'It doesn\'t matter what you call Him just as long as you call."', u"He commented on his beliefs:\n\nKrishna actually was in a body as a person ... What makes it complicated is, if he's God, what's he doing fighting on a battlefield?", u"It took me ages to try to figure that out, and again it was Yogananda's spiritual interpretation of the Bhagavad Gita that made me realise what it was.", u'Our idea of Krishna and Arjuna on the battlefield in the chariot.', u"So this is the point \u2013 that we're in these bodies, which is like a kind of chariot, and we're going through this incarnation, this life, which is kind of a battlefield.", u'The senses of the body ... are the horses pulling the chariot, and we have to get control over the chariot by getting control over the reins.', u'And Arjuna in the end says, "Please Krishna, you drive the chariot" because unless we bring Christ or Krishna or Buddha or whichever of our spiritual guides ... we\'re going to crash our chariot, and we\'re going to turn over, and we\'re going to get killed in the battlefield.', u'That\'s why we say "Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna", asking Krishna to come and take over the chariot.', u'Before his religious conversion, the only British performer known for similar activities had been Cliff Richard, whose conversion to Christianity in 1966 had gone largely unnoticed by the public.', u'"By contrast," wrote Inglis, "Harrison\'s spiritual journey was seen as a serious and important development that reflected popular music\'s increasing maturity ... what he, and the Beatles, had managed to overturn was the paternalistic assumption that popular musicians had no role other than to stand on stage and sing their hit songs."', u'=== Family and interests ===\n\nHarrison married the model Pattie Boyd on 21 January 1966, with McCartney as best man.', u"Harrison and Boyd had met in 1964 during the production of the film A Hard Day's Night, in which the 19-year-old Boyd had been cast as a schoolgirl.", u'They separated in 1974 and their divorce was finalised in 1977.', u'Boyd said her decision to end their marriage and leave Harrison was due largely to his repeated infidelities, culminating in an affair with Starr\'s wife Maureen, which Boyd called "the final straw".', u'She characterised the last year of their marriage as "fuelled by alcohol and cocaine", and she stated: "George used coke excessively, and I think it changed him ... it froze his emotions and hardened his heart."', u'She subsequently moved in with Eric Clapton, and they married in 1979.', u"Harrison married Dark Horse Records' secretary Olivia Trinidad Arias on 2 September 1978.", u'They had met at the Dark Horse offices in Los Angeles in 1974, and together had one son, Dhani Harrison, born on 1 August 1978.', u'He restored the English manor house and grounds of Friar Park, his home in Henley-on-Thames, where several of his music videos were filmed including "Crackerbox Palace"; the grounds also served as the background for the cover of All Things Must Pass.', u'He employed ten workers to maintain the 36-acre (150,000 m2) garden.', u'Harrison commented on gardening as a form of escapism: "Sometimes I feel like I\'m actually on the wrong planet, and it\'s great when I\'m in my garden, but the minute I go out the gate I think: \'What the hell am I doing here?\'"', u'His autobiography, I, Me, Mine, is dedicated "to gardeners everywhere".', u"The former Beatles publicist Derek Taylor helped Harrison write the book, which said little about the Beatles, focusing instead on Harrison's hobbies, music and lyrics.", u'Taylor commented: "George is not disowning the Beatles ... but it was a long time ago and actually a short part of his life."', u'Harrison had an interest in sports cars and motor racing; he was one of the 100 people who purchased the McLaren F1 road car.', u'He had collected photos of racing drivers and their cars since he was young; at 12 he had attended his first race, the 1955 British Grand Prix at Aintree.', u'He wrote "Faster" as a tribute to the Formula One racing drivers Jackie Stewart and Ronnie Peterson.', u"Proceeds from its release went to the Gunnar Nilsson cancer charity, set up after the Swedish driver's death from the disease in 1978.", u"Harrison's first extravagant car, a 1964 Aston Martin DB5, was sold at auction on 7 December 2011 in London.", u'An anonymous Beatles collector paid \xa3350,000 for the vehicle that Harrison had bought new in January 1965.', u"=== Relationships with the other Beatles ===\nFor most of the Beatles' career the relationships in the group were close.", u'According to Hunter Davies, "the Beatles spent their lives not living a communal life, but communally living the same life.', u'They were each other\'s greatest friends."', u'Harrison\'s ex-wife Pattie Boyd described how the Beatles "all belonged to each other" and admitted, "George has a lot with the others that I can never know about.', u'Nobody, not even the wives, can break through or even comprehend it."', u'Starr said, "We really looked out for each other and we had so many laughs together.', u'In the old days we\'d have the biggest hotel suites, the whole floor of the hotel, and the four of us would end up in the bathroom, just to be with each other".', u'He added, "there were some really loving, caring moments between four people: a hotel room here and there \u2013 a really amazing closeness.', u'Just four guys who loved each other.', u'It was pretty sensational."', u'Lennon stated that his relationship with Harrison was "one of young follower and older guy ... [he] was like a disciple of mine when we started."', u'The two later bonded over their LSD experiences, finding common ground as seekers of spirituality.', u'They took radically different paths thereafter, Harrison finding God and Lennon coming to the conclusion that people are the creators of their own lives.', u'In 1974 Harrison said of his former bandmate: "John Lennon is a saint and he\'s heavy-duty, and he\'s great and I love him.', u'But at the same time, he\'s such a bastard \u2013 but that\'s the great thing about him, you see?"', u'Harrison and McCartney were the first of the Beatles to meet, having shared a school bus, and often learned and rehearsed new guitar chords together.', u'McCartney stated that he and Harrison usually shared a bedroom while touring.', u"McCartney was best man at Harrison's wedding in 1966, and was the only Beatle in attendance.", u'McCartney has referred to Harrison as his "baby brother".', u'In a 1974 BBC radio interview with Alan Freeman, Harrison stated: "[McCartney] ruined me as a guitar player".', u"Perhaps the most significant obstacle to a Beatles reunion after the death of Lennon was Harrison and McCartney's personal relationship, as both men admitted that they often got on each other's nerves.", u'Rodriguez commented: "Even to the end of George\'s days, theirs was a volatile relationship".', u'=== Humanitarian work ===\nHarrison was involved in humanitarian and political activism throughout his life.', u'In the 1960s, the Beatles supported the civil rights movement and protested against the Vietnam War.', u"After the band's break-up, Ravi Shankar consulted Harrison about how to provide aid to the people of Bangladesh after the 1970 Bhola cyclone and the Bangladesh Liberation War.", u'Harrison recorded the song "Bangla Desh", and pushed Apple Records to release his song alongside Shankar\'s "Joy Bangla" in an effort to raise funds.', u"Shankar then asked for Harrison's advice about planning a small charity event in the US.", u'Harrison responded by organising the Concert for Bangladesh, which raised more than $240,000.', u'In June 1972, UNICEF honoured Harrison and Shankar with the "Child Is the Father of Man" award at an annual ceremony in recognition of their fundraising efforts for Bangladesh.', u'The George Harrison Humanitarian Fund for UNICEF, a joint effort between the Harrison family and the US Fund for UNICEF, aims to support programmes that help children caught in humanitarian emergencies.', u'In December 2007, they donated $450,000 to help the victims of Cyclone Sidr in Bangladesh.', u'On 13 October 2009, the first George Harrison Humanitarian Award went to Ravi Shankar for his efforts in saving the lives of children, and his involvement with the Concert for Bangladesh.', u"== HandMade Films ==\n\nIn 1973 Peter Sellers introduced Harrison to Denis O'Brien.", u'Soon after, the two went into business together.', u"In 1978, in an effort to produce Monty Python's Life of Brian, they formed the film production and distribution company HandMade Films.", u'Harrison explained: "The name of the company came about as a bit of a joke.', u"I'd been to Wooky Hole in Somerset ... [near] an old paper mill where they show you how to make old underpants into paper.", u"So I bought a few rolls, and they had this watermark 'British Handmade Paper' ...", u'So we said ... we\'ll call it Handmade Films."', u'Their opportunity for investment came after EMI Films withdrew funding at the demand of their Chief Executive, Bernard Delfont.', u'Harrison financed the production of Life of Brian in part by mortgaging his home, which Idle later called "the most anybody\'s ever paid for a cinema ticket in history."', u'The film grossed $21 million at the box office in the US.', u"The first film distributed by HandMade Films was The Long Good Friday (1980), and the first they produced was Time Bandits (1981), co-scripted project by Monty Python's Terry Gilliam and Michael Palin.", u'The film featured a new song by Harrison, "Dream Away", in the closing credits.', u"Time Bandits became one of HandMade's most successful and acclaimed efforts; with a budget of $5 million, it earned $35 million in the US within ten weeks of its release.", u'Harrison served as executive producer for 23 films with HandMade, including Mona Lisa, Shanghai Surprise and Withnail and I.', u'He made several cameo appearances in these films, including a role as a nightclub singer in Shanghai Surprise, for which he recorded five new songs.', u'According to author and musicologist Ian Inglis, Harrison\'s "executive role in HandMade Films helped to sustain British cinema at a time of crisis, producing some of the country\'s most memorable movies of the 1980s."', u'A series of box office bombs in the late 1980s caused HandMade to cease operations in 1991;

Roosevelt's in the 1932 presidential election, Long split with Roosevelt in June 1933 to plan his own presidential bid for 1936 in alliance with the influential Catholic priest and radio commentator Charles Coughlin.", u'Long was assassinated in 1935, and his national movement soon faded, but his legacy continued in Louisiana through his wife, Senator Rose McConnell Long, and his son, Senator Russell B.', u'Long.', u"Under Long's leadership, hospitals and educational institutions were expanded, a system of charity hospitals was set up that provided health care for the poor, massive highway construction and free bridges brought an end to rural isolation, and free textbooks were provided for schoolchildren.", u'He remains a controversial figure in Louisiana history, with critics and supporters debating if he was a dictator, a demagogue, or a populist.', u'== Early life and legal career ==\nLong was born on August 30, 1893, near Winnfield, the seat of government of Winn Parish, a small town in the north-central part of Louisiana.', u'He was the son of Huey Pierce Long, Sr. (1852\u20131937) and the former Caledonia Palestine Tison (1860\u20131913).', u"At the time of his youth, Winn Parish was a deeply impoverished region whose people, mostly modest Southern Baptists were known for their cantankerous stubbornness and for being outsiders in Louisiana's political system.", u'During the Civil War, Winn Parish had been a stronghold of Unionism in an otherwise solidly Confederate state, in the 1890s a bastion of the Populist Party and in 1912 the majority in Winn Parish had voted for the Socialist Party.', u'The degree of poverty in Winn Parish was extreme, but in general Louisiana was a very poor state noted mostly for the scale of its corruption with the 1930 census showing that one-fifth of the white men in Louisiana were illiterate with illiteracy rates far higher amongst the blacks.', u'As someone who was born and grew up in Winn Parish, Long inherited all of the resentments of its people against the elite in Baton Rouge who ruled Louisiana.', u'Long was the seventh of nine surviving children in a farm-owning middle-class family.', u'He was home-schooled as a young child and later attended local schools, where he was an excellent student and was said to have a remarkable memory.', u'In 1908, upon completing the eleventh grade, Long circulated a petition protesting the addition of a 12th-grade graduation requirement, which resulted in his expulsion.', u'Long won a debating scholarship to Louisiana State University, but he was unable to afford the textbooks required for attendance.', u'Instead, he spent the next five years as a traveling salesman, selling books, canned goods and patent medicines, as well as working as an auctioneer.', u'In 1913, Long married Rose McConnell.', u'She was a stenographer who had won a baking contest which he promoted to sell "Cottolene", one of the most popular of the early vegetable shortenings to come on the market.', u'The Longs had a daughter, also named Rose, and two sons, Russell (1918\u20132003) (later a seven-term U.S.', u'Senator) and Palmer (1921\u20132010) (a Shreveport oilman).', u'When sales jobs grew scarce during World War I, Long attended seminary classes at Oklahoma Baptist University at the urging of his mother, a devout Baptist, but he decided he was not suited to preaching.', u'Long briefly attended the University of Oklahoma College of Law in Norman, Oklahoma, and later Tulane University Law School in New Orleans.', u'In 1915 after only a year at Tulane, he convinced a board to let him take the state bar exam.', u'He passed and began private practice in Winnfield.', u"Later, in Shreveport, he spent ten years representing small plaintiffs against large businesses, including workers' compensation cases.", u'He often said proudly that he never took a case against a poor man.', u'Long won fame by taking on the powerful Standard Oil Company, which he sued for unfair business practices.', u"Over the course of his career, Long continued to challenge Standard Oil's influence in state politics and charged the company with exploiting the state's vast oil and gas resources.", u'== Political career and rise to power ==\nIn 1918 Long was elected to the Louisiana Railroad Commission (renamed the Louisiana Public Service Commission in 1921) at the age of 25 on an anti-Standard Oil platform.', u'His campaign for the Railroad Commission used techniques he would perfect later in his political career: heavy use of printed circulars and posters, an exhaustive schedule of personal campaign stops throughout rural Louisiana, and vehement attacks on his opponents.', u'He used his position on the Commission to enhance his populist reputation as an opponent of large oil and utility companies, fighting against rate increases and pipeline monopolies.', u'In the gubernatorial election of 1920, he campaigned prominently for John M. Parker, but later became his vocal opponent after the new governor proved to be insufficiently committed to reform, later calling him the "chattel" of the corporations.', u'As chairman of the Public Service Commission in 1922, Long won a lawsuit against the Cumberland Telephone & Telegraph Company for unfair rate increases, resulting in cash refunds of $440,000 to 80,000 overcharged customers.', u'Long successfully argued the case on appeal before the United States Supreme Court (Comberland Telephone & Telegraph Co. v.Louisiana Public Service Commission et al., 260 U.S. 212 (1922),[1] prompting Chief Justice William Howard Taft to describe Long as one of the best legal minds he had ever encountered.', u'=== Election of 1924 ===\nLong ran for governor of Louisiana in the election of 1924, attacking Parker, Standard Oil, and the established political hierarchy both locally and statewide.', u'In that campaign, he became one of the first Southern politicians to use radio addresses and sound trucks.', u'Long also began wearing a distinctive white linen suit.', u'He came in third and although he and another candidate had privately opposed the powerful Ku Klux Klan, a third candidate had openly supported it.', u"The Klan's prominence in Louisiana was the primary issue of the campaign.", u'Long cited rain on election day as suppressing voter turnout among his base in rural north Louisiana, where voters were unable to reach the polls on dirt roads that had turned to mud.', u'Instead, Long was reelected to the Public Service Commission.', u'His former law partner and political ally, Harvey Fields, a former state senator for Union and Morehouse parishes, succeeded Long on the PSC and served from 1927 to 1936.', u'=== Gubernatorial election of 1928 ===\n\nLong spent the intervening four years building his reputation and his political organization, including supporting Roman Catholic candidates to build support in southern Louisiana, which was heavily Catholic due to its French and Spanish heritage.', u'In 1928 he again ran for governor, campaigning with the slogan, "Every man a king, but no one wears a crown," a phrase adopted from Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan.', u'Long\'s attacks on the utilities industry and corporate privileges were enormously popular, as was his depiction of the wealthy as "parasites" who grabbed more than their fair share of the public wealth while marginalizing the poor.', u'Long criss-crossed the state, campaigning in rural areas disenfranchised by the New Orleans-based political establishment, known as the "Old Regulars" or "the Ring."', u'They controlled the state through alliances with sheriffs and other local officials.', u"At the time, the rural poor comprised 60 percent of the state's population.", u'The entire state had roughly three hundred miles of paved roads and only three major bridges.', u'The literacy rate was the lowest in the nation (75 percent illiterate), as most families could not afford to purchase the textbooks required for their children to attend school.', u'A poll tax kept many poor whites from voting; of the two million residents, only 300,000 could afford to register to vote.', u'In addition, with selective application of literacy tests, blacks had been effectively completely disenfranchised since soon after the state legislature passed the new constitution in 1898.', u'Long won the 1928 gubernatorial election by tapping into the class resentment of rural Louisianans.', u"He proposed government services far more expansive than anything in his state's history.", u'His campaign manager was the Catholic Cajun Harvey Peltier, Sr., a state representative and lawyer/banker from Thibodaux in Lafourche Parish.', u'Long had the backing of the timber businessman Swords Lee, his cousin by marriage and a former state representative for Grant Parish.', u'On January 17, 1928, Long won the Democratic primary election but failed to secure a majority of the vote.', u'He polled 126,842 votes (43.9 percent).', u'His opponents split the remaining 56 percent of the ballots.', u'U.S. Representative Riley J. Wilson earned 81,747 votes (28.3 percent), and the short-term incumbent Governor Oramel H. Simpson garnered 80,326 (27.8 percent).', u"At the time, Long's margin was the largest in state history, and neither opponent chose to face him in a runoff election as was permitted in Louisiana.", u'He was elected governor in the general election on April 17, 1928, with 92,941 votes (96.1 percent), to 3,733 for the Republican candidate, Etienne J. Caire.', u"Caire's running mate, John E. Jackson, a New Orleans lawyer who later took over the state Republican chairmanship, ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor against Paul N. Cyr, with whom Long later had an irreconcilable break.", u'The next Republican gubernatorial candidate, Harrison Bagwell, a Baton Rouge attorney who supported Dwight Eisenhower for U.S. President, also polled 4 percent of the vote in his 1952 contest against Democrat Robert F. Kennon, a leader of the anti-Long forces.', u'Three LSU scholars contend that before his governorship "political power in Louisiana had been nearly a monopoly of the coalition of businessmen and planters, reinforced by the oil and other industrial interests.', u'This situation was changed when Long won the hearts and votes of the farmers and other \'small people\' and created a countervailing power combination."', u'At least one statewide official bucked the Long trend.', u'Percy Saint of St. Mary Parish was reelected to a second term as Attorney General independent of Long and several times ruled against Long during his gubernatorial term.', u'== Governorship, 1928\u20131932 ==\nOnce in office as governor on May 21, 1928, Long moved quickly to consolidate his power, firing hundreds of opponents in the state bureaucracy, at all ranks from cabinet-level heads of departments and board members to rank-and-file civil servants and state road workers.', u'Like previous governors, he filled the vacancies with patronage appointments from his own network of political supporters.', u"Every state employee who depended on Long for a job was expected to pay a portion of his or her salary at election time directly into Long's political war-chest, which raised $50,000 to $75,000 (equivalent to about $700,000 to $1,000,000 in 2013 dollars) each election cycle.", u'The funds were kept in a famous locked "deduct box" to be used at Long\'s discretion for political and personal purposes.', u'The American historian David Kennedy wrote that the extremely authoritarian regime Long established in Louisiana was "...the closest thing to a dictatorship that America has ever known".', u"Once his control over the state's political apparatus was strengthened, Long pushed a number of bills through the 1929 session of the Louisiana State Legislature to fulfill campaign promises.", u'These included a free textbook program for schoolchildren, an idea advanced by John Sparks Patton, the Claiborne Parish school superintendent, and the Long confidant, Representative Harley Bozeman of Winnfield.', u'Long also supported night courses for adult literacy (which taught 100,000 adults to read by the end of his term), and a supply of cheap natural gas for the city of New Orleans.', u'Long began an unprecedented public works program, building roads, bridges, hospitals, and educational institutions.', u'His bills met opposition from many legislators, wealthy citizens, and the media, but Long used aggressive tactics to ensure passage of the legislation he favored.', u'He would show up unannounced on the floor of both the House and Senate or in House committees, corralling reluctant representatives and state senators and bullying opponents.', u"These tactics were unprecedented, but they resulted in the passage of most of Long's legislative agenda.", u"By delivering on his campaign promises, Long achieved hero status among the state's rural poor population.", u'When Long secured passage of his free textbook program, the school board of Caddo Parish, home of conservative Shreveport, sued to prevent the books from being distributed, saying it would not accept "charity" from the state.', u'Long responded by withholding authorization for locating an Army Air Corps base nearby until the parish accepted the books.', u'=== Impeachment attempt ===\nIn 1929, Long called a special session of both houses of the legislature to enact a new five-cent per barrel "occupational license tax" on production of refined oil, to help fund his social programs.', u"The bill met with fierce opposition from the state's oil interests.", u'Opponents in the legislature, led by freshman lawmakers Cecil Morgan of Shreveport and Ralph Norman Bauer of Franklin in St. Mary Parish, moved to impeach Long on charges ranging from blasphemy to abuses of power, bribery, and the misuse of state funds.', u'Long tried to cut the session short, but after an infamous brawl that spilled across the State Legislature on what was known as "Bloody Monday," the Legislature voted to remain in session and proceed with the impeachment.', u'Long took his case to the people using his characteristic speaking tours.', u'He inundated the state with his trademark circulars.', u'He argued that Standard Oil, corporate interests, and the conservative political opposition were conspiring to stop him from providing roads, books, and other programs to develop the state and to assist the poor and downtrodden.', u'The House referred many charges to the Senate.', u'Conviction required a two-thirds majority, but Long produced a "Round Robin" statement signed by fifteen senators pledging to vote "not guilty" no matter what the evidence.', u'They said the trial was illegal, and even if proved, the charges did not warrant impeachment.', u'The impeachment process, now futile, was suspended.', u'It has been alleged that both sides used bribes to buy votes, and that Long later rewarded the Round Robin signers with state jobs or other favors.', u'Following the failed impeachment attempt in the Senate, Long became ruthless when dealing with his enemies.', u'He fired their relatives from state jobs and supported candidates to defeat them in elections.', u'After impeachment, Long appeared to have concluded that extra-legal means would be needed to defend the interests of the common people against the powerful money interests.', u'"I used to try to get things done by saying \'please\'," said Long.', u'"Now...I dynamite \'em out of my path."', u"Since the state's newspapers were financed by the opposition, in March 1930 Long founded his own paper, the Louisiana Progress, which he used to broadcast achievements and denounce his enemies.", u"To receive lucrative state contracts, companies were first expected to buy advertisements in Long's newspaper.", u'Long attempted to pass laws placing a surtax on newspapers and forbidding the publishing of "slanderous material," but these efforts were defeated.', u'After the impeachment attempt, Long received death threats.', u'Fearing for his personal safety, he surrounded himself with armed bodyguards at all times.', u'=== 1930: Change of course ===\nIn the 1930 legislative session, Long proposed another major road-building initiative as well as the construction of a new capitol building in Baton Rouge.', u'The State Legislature defeated the bond issue necessary to build the roads, and his other initiatives failed as well.', u'Long responded by suddenly announcing his intention to run for the U.S. Senate in the Democratic primary of September 9, 1930.', u'He portrayed his campaign as a referendum on his programs: if he won he would take it as a sign that the public supported his programs over the opposition of the legislature, and if he lost he promised to resign.', u'Long defeated incumbent Senator Joseph E. Ransdell, an Alexandria native from Lake Providence in East Carroll Parish, by 149,640 (57.3 percent) to 111,451 (42.7 percent).', u'Although his Senate term began on March 4, 1931, Long completed the remainder of his four-year term as governor.', u'Leaving the seat vacant for so long, he said, would not hurt Louisiana; "with Ransdell as Senator, the seat was vacant anyway."', u"By not leaving the governor's mansion until January 25, 1932, Long prevented Lieutenant Governor Paul N. Cyr, a former ally, from succeeding to the office.", u'A dentist from Jeanerette in Iberia Parish, Cyr had subsequently broken with Long and been threatening to roll back his reforms if he succeeded to the governorship.', u'=== 1930\u20131932: Renewed strength ===\nHaving won the overwhelming support of the Louisiana electorate, Long returned to pushing his legislative program with renewed strength.', u'Bargaining from an advantageous position, Long entered an agreement with his longtime New Orleans rivals, the Regular Democratic Organization and their leader, New Orleans mayor T. Semmes Walmsley.', u'They would support his legislation and candidates in future elections in return for his support of the building of a bridge over the Mississippi River, an airport for New Orleans, and infrastructure improvements in the city.', u'Support from the Old Regulars enabled Long to pass an increase in the gasoline tax to finance road construction projects, new school spending, a construction of a new Louisiana State Capitol, and a $75 million bond for road construction.', u"Including the Airline Highway between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, Long's road network gave Louisiana some of the most modern roads in the country and formed the state's highway system.", u"Long's opponents charged that he had become virtual dictator of the state.", u"Long retained New Orleans architect Leon C. Weiss to design the state capitol, a new governor's mansion, the Charity Hospital in New Orleans, and many Louisiana State University buildings, and other college buildings throughout the state.", u'As governor, Long was not popular among the "old families" of Baton Rouge society.', u'He instead held gatherings of his leaders and friends from across the state.', u'At these gatherings, Long and his group liked to listen to the popular radio show "Amos \'n\' Andy."', u'One of Long\'s followers dubbed him "the Kingfish" after the master of the Mystic Knights of the Sea lodge to which the fictional Amos and Andy belonged.', u'The character of the "Kingfish" was a stereotypical, smooth-talking African-American conman who was forever trying to trick Amos and Andy into various get-rich schemes.', u"The nickname stuck\u2014with Long's encouragement.", u"As governor, Long became an ardent supporter of the state's primary public university, Louisiana State University (LSU) in Baton Rouge.", u"He greatly increased LSU's state funding and expanded its enrollment from study programs that enabled poor students to attend LSU and he established the LSU Medical School in New Orleans.", u"He also intervened in the university's affairs, choosing its president.", u'To generate excitement for the university, he quadrupled the size of the LSU band and co-wrote some of the music that is still played during football games, including "Touchdown for LSU."', u'Once, he had the football team run a play he created.', u'He also chartered trains to take LSU students to out-of-state football games.', u"In October 1931, Lieutenant Governor Cyr, by then Long's avowed enemy, argued that the Senator-elect could no longer remain governor.", u"Cyr declared himself the state's legitimate governor.", u'In response, Long ordered state National Guard troops to surround the State Capitol and fended off Cyr\'s proposed "coup d\'\xe9tat."', u'Long then went to the Louisiana Supreme Court to have Cyr ousted as lieutenant governor.', u'He argued that the office of lieutenant-governor was vacant because Cyr had resigned when he attempted to assume the governorship.', u'His suit was successful.', u'Under the state constitution, Senate president and Long ally Alvin Olin King became lieutenant-governor and then, briefly from January to May 1932, governor.', u'Long chose his childhood friend, Oscar K. Allen, to succeed King in the January, 1932, election on a "Complete the Work" ticket.', u"With the support of Long's voter base and the Old Regular machine, Allen won easily, permitting Long to resign as governor and take his seat in the U.S. Senate in January 1932.", u"== In the U.S. Senate (1932\u20131935) ==\nLong's three-year tenure in the Senate overlapped an important time in American history as Herbert Hoover and then FDR attempted to deal with the Great Depression.", u'Long often attempted to upstage FDR and the congressional leadership by mounting populist appeals of his own, most notably his "Share Our Wealth" program.', u'Long arrived in Washington, D.C., to take his seat in the United States Senate in January 1932, although he was absent for more than half the days in the 1932 session.', u'With the backdrop of the Great Depression, he made characteristically fiery speeches which denounced the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few.', u'He also criticized the leaders of both parties for failing to address the crisis adequately, most notably attacking conservative Senate Democratic Leader Joseph Robinson of Arkansas for his apparent closeness with President Herbert Hoover and ties to big business.', u'Robinson had been the vice-presidential candidate in 1928 on the Democratic ticket opposite Hoover.', u'Long had now earned a reputation, as Williams reports, as "a leading member of the progressive bloc in the Senate."', u'In the presidential election of 1932, Long became a vocal supporter of the candidacy of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.', u'He believed Roosevelt to be the only candidate willing and able to carry out the drastic redistribution of wealth that Long believed was necessary to end the Great Depression.', u'At the Democratic National Convention, Long was instrumental in keeping the delegations of several wavering states in the Roosevelt camp.', u"Long expected to be featured prominently in Roosevelt's campaign, but he was disappointed with a speaking tour limited to four Midwestern states.", u'Long managed to find other venues for his populist message.', u'He campaigned to elect Senator Hattie Caraway of Arkansas, the underdog candidate in a crowded field, to her first full term in the Senate by conducting a whirlwind, seven-day tour of that state.', u"(Caraway had been appointed to the seat after her husband's death.)", u'He raised his national prominence and defeated by a landslide the candidate backed by Senator Robinson.', u"With Long's help, Caraway became the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate.", u'Caraway told Long, however, that she would continue to use independent judgment and not allow him to dictate how she would vote on Senate bills.', u'She also insisted that he stop attacking Robinson while he was in Arkansas.', u'In the critical 100 days in spring 1933, Long was generally a strong supporter of the New Deal, but differed with the president on patronage.', u'Roosevelt wanted control of the patronage and the two men broke in late 1933.', u"Aware that Roosevelt had no intention to radically redistribute the country's wealth, Long became one of the few national politicians to oppose Roosevelt's New Deal policies from the left.", u'He considered them inadequate in the face of the escalating economic crisis.', u'Long sometimes supported Roosevelt\'s programs in the Senate, saying that "Whenever this administration has gone to the left I have voted with it, and whenever it has gone to the right I have voted against it."', u'He opposed the National Recovery Act, calling it a sellout to big business.', u'In 1933, he was a leader of a three-week Senate filibuster against the Glass banking bill for favoring the interests of national banks over state banks.', u'He later supported the Glass\u2013Steagall Act after provisions were made to extend government deposit insurance to state banks as well as national banks.', u'Long was known as the most colorful Senators of all time, leading Kennedy to write that "...Long strode into the national arena in the role of the hillbilly hero and played it with gusto.', u'He wore white silk suits and pink silk ties, womanized openly, swilled whiskey in the finest bars, swaggered his way around Washington, and breathed defiance into the teeth of his critics.', u'The president\'s mother called him "that awful man".', u'His friends called "the Kingfish", after a character on the radio program Amos \'n\' Andy ("Der Kingfish", said Long\'s critics, seeing parallels with another dangerous demagogue.)', u'The New York Times called him "a man with a front of brass and lungs of leather"".', u"Long's flamboyant ways and populist style made him into one of the best known Senators in the nation.", u'Roosevelt considered Long a radical demagogue.', u'The president privately said of Long that along with General Douglas MacArthur, "[H]e was one of the two most dangerous men in America."', u'In June 1933, Long visited the White House to meet President Roosevelt.', u'The meeting was a disaster with Long engaging in an act of flagrant disrespect by refusing to take off his straw hat and addressing Roosevelt as "Frank", instead of the normal "Mr. President".', u"Shortly after that meeting in June 1933, in an effort to undermine Long's political dominance, Roosevelt cut Long out of consultation on the distribution of federal funds or patronage in Louisiana and placed Long's opponents in charge of federal programs in the state.", u'Roosevelt also supported a Senate inquiry into the election of Long ally John H. Overton to the Senate in 1932.', u'The Long machine was charged with election fraud and voter intimidation but the inquiry came up empty, and Overton was seated.', u"To discredit Long and damage his support base, in 1934 Roosevelt had Long's finances investigated by the Internal Revenue Service.", u"Though they failed to link Long to any illegality, some of Long's lieutenants were charged with income tax evasion, but only one had been convicted by the time of Long's death.", u'Until 1934, Long was not known for his opinions on foreign policy.', u'On 30 May 1934, Long took to the Senate floor to debate the abrogation of the Platt amendment.', u'Instead of debating the Platt amendment, Long gave his views on the Chaco War, coming out in support of Paraguay against Bolivia as he maintained that President Hayes had awarded the Chaco to Paraguay in 1878.', u'Long blamed the entire war on "the forces of imperialistic finance", claiming that Paraguay was the rightful owner of the Chaco, but that Standard Oil, whom Long called "promoter of revolutions in Central America, South America and Mexico" had "bought" the Bolivian government and started the war because Paraguay was unwilling to grant them oil concessions.', u'Long ended his speech by claiming the entire bloody Chaco War was due to the machinations of Wall Street, called the American arms embargo to both sides as subservience to the "big papa" of Wall Street and stated: "Well should we begin on Memorial Day, the hour of mourning to understand that the imperialistic principles of the Standard Oil Company have become mightier than the solemn treaties and pronouncements of the United States government".', u"Long's speech made him a national hero in Paraguay while leading to protests from the Bolivian legation in Washington.", u"Long's thesis that the U.S policy towards Latin America was dictated solely by the selfish concerns of oil companies, and the U.S. was maintaining a pro-Bolivian neutrality only because that is what Standard Oil wanted, attracted much attention in Latin American newspapers.", u'The State Department was greatly concerned about the damage Long was inflicting on the reputation of the U.S, and throughout the summer of 1934 American diplomats waged a sustained public relations campaign against Long throughout Latin America.', u'In a second speech given on 7 June 1934 in response to the Bolivian protests, Long again came out in support of Paraguay and attacked Standard Oil as "domestic murderers", "foreign murderers", "international conspirators" and "rapacious thieves and robbers".', u'Besides abusing Standard Oil, Long announced that since Bolivia was taking the Chaco dispute to the World Court, he was opposed to the United States joining the World Court, saying: "Bolivia has run over to the famous World Court and the League of Nations.', u'So here is the Standard Oil Company of the United States sailing under the title of Bolivia, putting one of their emissaries on a boat, and skyrocketing him to Geneva to renounce the Hayes award of the United States".', u'In July 1934, after a capturing a Bolivian fort, the Paraguayans renamed it Fort Long, much to the delight of the "Kingfish".', u'In terms of foreign policy, Long was a firm isolationist.', u"He argued that America's involvement in the Spanish\u2013American War and the First World War had been deadly mistakes conducted on behalf of Wall Street.", u'He also opposed American entry into the World Court.', u"Long's radical populist rhetoric and his aggressive tactics did little to endear him to his fellow senators.", u'Not one of his proposed bills, resolutions or motions was passed during his three years in the Senate despite an overwhelming Democratic majority.', u'During one debate, another senator told Long, "I do not believe you could get the Lord\'s Prayer endorsed in this body."', u'=== Share Our Wealth ===\n\nLong was a staunch opponent of the Federal Reserve Bank.', u"Together with a group of Congressmen and Senators, Long believed the Federal Reserve's policies to be the true cause of the Great Depression.", u'Long made speeches denouncing the large banking houses of Morgan and Rockefeller centered in New York which owned stock in the Federal Reserve System.', u"He believed that they manipulated the monetary system to their own benefit, instead of the general public's benefit.", u'In March 1933, Long offered a series of bills collectively known as "the Long plan" for the redistribution of wealth.', u'The first bill proposed a new progressive tax code designed to cap personal fortunes at $100 million.', u'Fortunes above $1 million would be taxed at 1 percent; fortunes above $2 million would be taxed at 2 percent, and so forth, up to a 100 percent tax on fortunes greater than $100 million.', u'The second bill limited annual income to $1 million, and the third bill capped individual inheritances at $5 million.', u'In February 1934, Long introduced his Share Our Wealth plan over a nationwide radio broadcast.', u'He proposed capping personal fortunes at $50 million and repeated his call to limit annual income to $1 million and inheritances to $5 million.', u'(He also suggested reducing the cap on personal fortunes to $10 million\u2013$15 million per individual, if necessary, and later lowered the cap to $5 million\u2013$8 million in printed materials.)', u'The resulting funds would be used to guarantee every family a basic household grant or "household estate" as Long called it of $5,000 and a minimum annual income of $2,000\u20133,000, or one-third of the average family homestead value and income.', u"Long supplemented his plan with proposals for free college education and vocational training for all able students, old-age pensions, veterans' benefits, federal assistance to farmers, public works projects, greater federal regulation of economic activity, a month's vacation for every worker and limiting the work week to thirty hours to boost employment.", u'In his speech, Long used populist language depicting the U.S past as a lost paradise stolen by the rich, saying:\n\n"God invited us all to come and eat and drink all we wanted.', u'He smiled on our land and we grew corps of plenty to eat and wear.', u'He showed us in the earth the iron and other things to make everything we wanted.', u'He unfolded to us the secrets of science so that our work might be easy.', u"God called: 'Come to my feast!'.", u'But then Rockfeller, Morgan and their crowd stepped up and took enough for 120,000,000 people and left only enough for 5,000,000 for all the other 125,000,000 to eat.', u'And so many millions must go hungry and without those good things God gave us unless we call on them to put some of it back!".', u'Long\'s plans for the "Share Our Wealth" program attracted much criticism from economists at the time, stating that Long\'s plans for redistributing wealth would not result in every American family receiving a grant of $5,000 per year, but rather $400/per year and his plans for confiscatory taxation would cap the average annual income at about $3,000.', u'Denying that his program was socialist, Long stated that his ideological inspiration for the plan came not from Karl Marx but from the Bible and the Declaration of Independence.', u'"Communism?', u'Hell no!"', u'he said, "This plan is the only defense this country\'s got against communism."', u'In 1934, Long held a public debate with Norman Thomas, the leader of the Socialist Party of America, on the merits of Share Our Wealth versus socialism.', u'Long is oft quoted as saying, "When Fascism comes to America it will be called anti-Fascism," which was often confused with the words of Minnesota-born novelist and playwright Sinclair Lewis, the first American to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, who said, "When fascism comes to America, it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying the cross."', u'Long believed that ending the Great Depression and staving off violent revolution required a radical restructuring of the national economy and elimination of disparities of wealth, retaining the essential features of the capitalist system.', u'After the Senate rejected one of his wealth redistribution bills, Long told them, "[A] mob is coming to hang the other ninety-five of you damn scoundrels and I\'m undecided whether to stick here with you or go out and lead them."', u'With the Senate unwilling to support his proposals, in February 1934 Long formed a national political organization, the Share Our Wealth Society.', u'A network of local clubs led by national organizer Reverend Gerald L.

Allen, dutifully enacted Long's policies.", u"Long berated the governor in public and took over the governor's office in the State Capitol when visiting Baton Rouge.", u"On occasion, he even entered the legislative chambers, going so far as to sit on representatives' and senators' desks and sternly lecture them on his positions.", u'He also retaliated against those who voted against him and used patronage and state funding (especially highways) to maneuver Louisiana toward what opponents called a Long "dictatorship".', u"Having broken with the Old Regulars and T. Semmes Walmsley in the fall of 1933, Long inserted himself into the New Orleans mayoral election of 1934 and began a dramatic public feud with the city's government that lasted for two years.", u'In 1934, Long and James A. Noe, an independent oilman and member of the Louisiana Senate, formed the controversial Win or Lose Oil Company.', u'The firm was established to obtain leases on state-owned lands so that its directors might collect bonuses and sublease the mineral rights to the major oil companies.', u'Although ruled legal, these activities were done in secret and the stockholders were unknown to the public.', u'Long made a profit on the bonuses and the resale of those state leases, using the funds primarily for political purposes.', u'By 1934, Long began a reorganization of the state government that reduced the authority of local governments in anti-Long strongholds New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and Alexandria.', u'It further gave the governor the power to appoint all state employees.', u'Long passed what he called "a tax on lying" and a 2 percent tax on newspaper advertising revenue.', u'He created the Bureau of Criminal Identification, a special force of plainclothes police answerable only to the governor.', u'He also had the legislature enact the same tax on refined oil that in 1929 had nearly led to his impeachment, which he used as a bargaining chip to promote oil drilling in Louisiana.', u"After Standard Oil agreed that 80 percent of the oil sent to its refineries would be drilled in Louisiana, Long's government refunded most of these tax revenues.", u"== 1935: Long's final year ==\n\nBy the summer of 1935, Long's Share Our Wealth clubs had 7.5 million members nationwide, he regularly garnered 25 million radio listeners, and he was receiving 60,000 letters a week from supporters (more than the president).", u'In his final year, Long was preoccupied with his presidential ambitions and attempted to limit the influence of his Louisiana opponents.', u"After his assassination, his political machine broke up into factions, although it has remained a strong force in the state's politics into the 21st century.", u'=== Presidential ambitions ===\nEven during his days as a traveling salesman, Long had confided to his wife that his planned career trajectory would begin with election to a minor state office, then governor, then senator, and ultimately President of the United States.', u'In his final months, Long followed up his earlier autobiography, Every Man a King, with a second book titled My First Days in the White House, laying out his plans for the presidency after the election of 1936.', u'The book was published posthumously.', u'Long was shot a month after announcing that he would run for president.', u'Long biographers T.

Johnson in a radio speech denounced Long and Coughlin as this "great Louisiana demagogue and this political padre", going on to accuse the duo of speaking "with nothing of learning, knowledge nor experience to lead us through a labyrinth that has perplexed the minds of men since the beginning of time...These two men are raging up and down this land preaching not construction, but destruction-not reform, but revolution!".', u'The Democratic National Committee chairman James Farley commissioned a secret poll in early 1935 "to find out if Huey\'s sales talks for his \'share the wealth\' program were attracting many customers...We kept a careful eye on what Huey and his political allies...were attempting to do".', u"Farley's poll revealed that if Long ran on a third party ticket, he would win about 4 million votes (about 10% of the electorate).", u'In a memo to Roosevelt, Farley wrote: "It was easy to conceive of a situation whereby Long by polling more than 3,000,000 votes, might have the balance of power in the 1936 election.', u'For example, the poll indicated that he would command upwards of 100,000 votes in New York State, a pivotal state in any national election and a vote of that size could easily mean the difference between victory and defeat...That number of votes would mostly come from our side and the result might spell disaster".', u'In response, Roosevelt in a letter to his friend, William E. Dodd who was serving as American ambassador in Berlin wrote: "Long plans to be a candidate of the Hitler type for the presidency in 1936.', u'He thinks he will have a hundred votes at the Democratic convention.', u'Then he will set up as an independent with Southern and mid-western Progressives...Thus he hopes to defeat the Democratic Party and put in a reactionary Republican.', u'That would bring the country to such a state by 1940 that Long thinks he would be made dictator.', u'There are in fact some Southerners looking that way, and some Progressives drifting that way...Thus it is an ominous situation".', u"=== Increased tensions in Louisiana ===\nBy 1935, Long's most recent consolidation of personal power led to talk of armed opposition from his enemies.", u"Opponents increasingly invoked the memory of the Battle of Liberty Place of 1874, in which the White League staged an uprising against Louisiana's Reconstruction-era government.", u'In January 1935, an anti-Long paramilitary organization called the Square Deal Association was formed.', u'Its members included former governors John M.

{'sentences': [u'Austrians (German: \xd6sterreicher) are a Germanic people, consisting of the population of the Republic of Austria, who share a common Austrian culture and Austrian descent and history.', u'The English term Austrians was applied to the population of Habsburg Austria from the 17th or 18th century.', u'Subsequently, during the 19th century, it referred to the citizens of the Empire of Austria (1804\u20131867), and from 1867 until 1918 to the citizens of Cisleithania.', u'In the closest sense, the term Austria originally referred to the historical March of Austria, corresponding roughly to the Vienna Basin in what is today Lower Austria.', u'Historically, Austrians were regarded as ethnic Germans and viewed themselves as such.', u'Austria was part of the Holy Roman Empire and the German Confederation until the Austro-Prussian war in 1866 which resulted in Prussia expelling Austria from the Confederation.', u'Thus, when Germany was founded as a nation-state in 1871, Austria was not a part of it.', u'In 1867, Austria was reformed into the Austro-Hungarian Empire.', u'After the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918 at the end of World War I, Austria was reduced to a rump state and adopted and officially used the name the Republic of German-Austria (Republik Deutsch\xf6sterreich) in an attempt for union with Germany, but was forbidden due to the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919).', u'The First Austrian Republic was founded in 1919.', u'The Third Reich annexed Austria with the Anschluss in 1938.', u'Since the fall of the Third Reich and the events of World War II, both the political ideology of pan-Germanism and the union with Germany have become discredited due to their association with Nazism, allowing Austrians to develop their own distinct national identity.', u'Today, majority of Austrians do not identify as German.', u'Austrians may be described either as a nationality or as a homogeneous Germanic ethnic group, that is closely related to neighboring Germans, Liechtensteiners and German-speaking Swiss.', u'== Name ==\n\nThe English word Austrian is a derivative of the proper name Austria, which is a latinization of \xd6sterreich, the German name for Austria.', u'This word is derived from Ostarr\xeechi, which first appears in 996.', u'This, in turn, is probably a translation of the Latin Marcha Orientalis, which means "eastern borderland" (viz.', u'delimiting the eastern border of the Holy Roman Empire).', u'It was a margraviate of the Duchy of Bavaria, ruled by the House of Babenberg from AD 976.', u'During the 12th century, the Marcha Orientalis under the Babenbergs became independent of Bavaria.', u'What is today known as Lower Austria corresponds to the Marcha Orientalis, while Upper Austria corresponds to the eastern half of the core territory of Bavaria (the western half forming part of the German state of Bavaria).', u'The adjective Austrian entered the English language in the early 17th century, at the time referring to Habsburg Austria the sense of "members of the Austrian branch of the House of Habsburg" (the junior branch emerging from the dynastic split into Austrian and Spanish Habsburgs in 1521), but from the 18th century also "a native or inhabitant of Austria".', u'== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe territory of what is today Austria in the Roman era was divided into Raetia, Noricum and Pannonia.', u'Noricum was a Celtic kingdom, while the Pannonii were of Illyrian stock.', u'The Raetians were an ancient alpine people probably akin to the Etruscans.', u'During the Migration period (c. 6th century), these territories were settled by the Bavarians and other Germanic groups in the west (Alemanni in Vorarlberg, Lombards in Tyrol), and by Slavic groups, Huns and Avars in the east.', u'In the 8th century, the former territories of Raetia and Noricum fell under Carolingian rule, and were divided into the duchies of Swabia, Bavaria and Carinthia.', u'Pannonia until the end of the 8th century was part of the Avar Khaganate.', u'The "East March" (Ostmark) during the 9th century was the boundary region separating East Francia from the Avars and the Magyars.', u'The site of Vienna had been settled since Celtic times (as Vindobona), but the city only rose to importance in the High Middle Ages as the chief settlement of the March of Austria (the March river just east of Vienna marks the ancient border between Francia and the Avars).', u'After the defeat of the Magyars at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955, the East March or March of Austria came to be the easternmost portion of the Holy Roman Empire, bordering on Moravia to the north and on the Kingdom of Hungary to the east.', u'As a consequence, the national character of the Austro-Bavarian speaking majority population of Austria throughout their early modern and modern history remained characterized by their neighbourhood to the West Slavs (Czechs, Slovaks) to the north, the South Slavs (Slovenians, Carinthian Slovenes, Burgenland Croats) to the south, and the Hungarians to the east.', u'The unification of the various territories of Austria outside of the March of Austria proper (i.e.', u'parts of Bavaria, Swabia and Carinthia) was a gradual process of feudal politics during the High and Late Middle Ages, at first in the Archduchy of Austria under the House of Babenberg during the 12th to 13th centuries, and under the House of Habsburg after 1278 and throughout the 14th and 15th centuries.', u'The various populations of these territories were not unified under the single name of "Austrians" before the early modern period.', u'=== Early Modern period ===\n\nThe Habsburg, who had ruled the territory of Austria since the Late Middle Ages, greatly increased their political prestige and power with the acquisition of the lands of the crowns of Hungary and Bohemia in 1526.', u"The Hungarian aristocracy was more successful at retaining the Magyars' cultural and political preponderance in multi-ethnic Hungary than Bohemia, on three sides surrounded by German neighbours, which underwent a period of intense German colonisation, germanizing the leading classes of the Czech people as well.", u'The common German identity of lands such as Carinthia, Styria, or Tyrol, and the ruling dynasty made it easier for these lands to accept the central government set up in Vienna in the mid-18th century.', u'The term Austrian in these times was used for identifying subjects of the Domus Austriae, the House of Austria, as the dynasty was called in Europe, regardless of their ethnic ancestry.', u'Although not formally a united state, the lands ruled by the Habsburgs would sometimes be known by the name "Austria".', u'In reality they remained a disparate range of semi-autonomous states, most of which were part of the complex network of states that was the Holy Roman Empire (the imperial institutions of which were themselves controlled for much of their later existence by the Habsburgs).', u'However, the second half of the 18th century saw an increasingly centralised state begin to develop under the regency of Maria Theresa of Austria and her son Joseph II.', u'After the French Revolution and the rise of Napoleon, the emperor Franz II formally founded the Austrian Empire in 1804 and became as Franz I the first Austrian emperor.', u"For the first time the citizens of the various territories were now subjects of the one same state, while most of the German states, Prussia excluded, still cultivated their Kleinstaaterei and didn't succeed in forming a homogenous empire before 1871 when the German Empire was founded.", u'A further major change resulted from a reorganisation of the Austrian Empire in 1867 into a dual monarchy, acknowledging the Kingdom of Hungary as an independent state bound to the remaining part of the empire, as well independent, by a personal and real union, the Emperor of Austria being the Apostolic King of Hungary (with both titles on the same level).', u'The Austrian half, a patchwork of crown-lands, broadly coterminous with the modern-day Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, and parts of Poland, Ukraine, Italy, and Croatia, was bound together by the common constitution of 1867, stating that all subjects now would carry "uniform Austrian citizenship" and have the same fundamental rights.', u'These non-Hungarian lands were not officially called the Austrian Empire.', u'Until 1915, they were officially called "the Kingdoms and States Represented in the Imperial Council" and politicians used the technical term Cisleithania (labelling the Hungarian lands as Transleithania).', u'The general public called them Austria, and in 1915, the non-parliamentary Cisleithanian government decreed to use this term officially, too.', u'=== 19th-century nationalism ===\n\nThe lands later called Cisleithania (except Galicia and Dalmatia) were members of the German Confederation since 1815 as they had been part of the Holy Roman Empire until 1806.', u'Until 1848, Austria and its chancellor Prince Metternich unanimously dominated the confederation.', u'The developing sense of a German nationality had been accelerated massively as a consequence of the political turmoil and wars that engulfed Central Europe following the French Revolution and the rise to power of Napoleon Bonaparte.', u"Although the years of peace after Napoleon's fall quickly saw German nationalism largely pushed out of the public political arena by reactionary absolutism, the Revolutions of 1848 established it as a significant political issue for a period of nearly hundred years.", u'Political debate now centred on the nature of a possible future German state to replace the Confederation, and part of that debate concerned the issue of whether or not the Austrian lands had a place in the German polity.', u'When Emperor Franz Joseph I ordered to build a monument in Vienna in 1860 to Archduke Charles, victor over Napoleon in the Battle of Aspern-Essling in 1809, it carried the dedication "To the persistent fighter for Germany\'s honour", to underline the Germanic mission of the House of Austria.', u'Habsburg influence over the German Confederation, which was strongest in the southern member states, was rivalled by the increasingly powerful Prussian state.', u'Political manoeuvering by the Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck resulted in military defeat of the Austrians in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 and the collapse of the Confederation, both effectively ending any future Austrian influence on German political events.', u'The so-called Franco-Prussian War and the establishment of a German Empire in 1871, headed by Prussia and pointedly excluding any of the Austrian lands, let the state turn away from Germany and turn its gaze towards the Balkan Peninsula.', u'Thereby the influence of pan-Germanism was diminished in the Habsburg territories, but as the term "Austrians" still was used supra-national, German-speaking Austrians considered themselves Germans (and were counted as such in the censuses).', u'The state as a whole tried to work out a sense of a distinctively Austrian identity.', u'While the high bureaucracy of Austria and many Austrian army officers considered themselves "black-yellow" (the Habsburg colours), i.e.', u'loyal to the dynasty, the term "Deutsch\xf6sterreich" (German Austria) appeared in the media to mean all Austrian districts with a German majority among the inhabitants.', u'Georg Ritter von Sch\xf6nerer\'s political party agitated against the "multi-national" Habsburgs and advocated for Deutsch\xf6sterreich joining Imperial Germany.', u'=== World Wars ===\n\nThe last year of World War I saw the collapse of Habsburg authority throughout an increasingly greater part of its empire.', u'On October 16, 1918, emperor Karl I invited the nations of Austria to create national councils, with the aim to instigate a restructuring of the state under Habsburg rule.', u'The nations followed the invitation (the Czechs had founded their national council already before the invitation) but ignored the will of the emperor to keep them in a restructured Austrian state.', u'Their goal was total independence.', u'On October 21, the German members of the Austrian parliament, elected in 1911, met in Vienna to found the Provisional National Assembly of German Austria ("Provisorische Nationalversammlung f\xfcr Deutsch\xf6sterreich").', u'On October 30, 1918 they installed the first German Austrian government, leaving the question "monarchy or republic" open.', u'(German nationalists and social democrats favoured the republic, the Christian Socialists wanted to keep the monarchy.)', u'This government in the first days of November took over the duties of the last imperial-royal government in a peaceful way.', u'Initially the new state adopted the name "German Austria", reflecting the republic being the German part of the old Austria and showing the popular desire to unite with the new German republic.', u'On November 12, 1918, the provisional national assembly voted for the republic and for unification with Germany with a large majority.', u'The creation of the Czecho-Slovak and South Slav states, the dissolution of the real union with Hungary, and the post-war treaties imposed by the victorious Allies combined to see the newly established Austrian republic both with the boundaries it has today, and a largely homogeneous German-speaking population.', u'In the Treaty of Saint-Germain, in September 1919 the union with Germany was prohibited, and the new republic\'s name "Deutsch\xf6sterreich" was prohibited by the treaty; instead the term "Republic of Austria" was used.', u"The westernmost province Vorarlberg's wish to unite with Switzerland as well was ignored.", u'On October 21, 1919, the state changed its name accordingly.', u'Many German Austrian communities were left scattered throughout the other new states, especially in Czechoslovakia, where more than 3 million German Bohemians had not been allowed to become part of the new Austrian state, as well as in the southern part of Tyrol which now found itself part of Italy.', u'In total, more than 3.5 million German-speaking Austrians were forced to remain outside the Austrian state.', u'The idea of unifying Austria with Germany was motivated both by a sense of a common national identity, and also by a fear that the new state, stripped of its one-time imperial possessions, and surrounded by potentially hostile nation-states, would not be economically viable.', u'Austrian identity emerged to some degree during the First Republic, and although Austria was still considered part of the "German nation" by most, Austrian patriotism was encouraged by the anti-Nazi/anti-Socialist clerico-authoritarianist state ideology known as Austrofascism from 1934-38.', u'Kurt von Schuschnigg called Austria "the better German state".', u'By March 1938, with Nazi governments in control of both Berlin and Vienna, the country was annexed to Germany (Anschluss) as Ostmark.', u'In 1942 the name was changed to the Danubian and Alpine Districts, thus eradicating any links with a special Austrian past.', u'Some of the most prominent Nazis were native Austrians, including Adolf Hitler, Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Arthur Seyss-Inquart, Franz Stangl, Otto Skorzeny, and Odilo Globocnik, as were 40% of the staff at Nazi extermination camps.', u"During the war, Austrians' infatuation with Germany faded as Austrian-born Hitler's series of victories ended.", u'When social democrat Adolf Sch\xe4rf, from 1945 party president and vice-chancellor and from 1957 federal president of Austria, was visited by German friends who wanted to talk about post-war government, he spontaneously explained to his surprised visitors, "love for Germany has been put out in Austrians".', u'When the allies declared that they would reestablish an independent Austrian state after their victory (the Moscow Declaration of 1943) the only Austrians who heard them were those secretly listening to enemy broadcasts ("Feindsender"), which was a criminal offence and heavily prosecuted.', u"Though the Allied forces treated Austria as a belligerent party in the war and maintained occupation of it after the Nazi capitulation, they accepted the Declaration of Independence which Austrian politicians had signed at Vienna's city hall on April 27, 1945, and they made the first national elections possible in the autumn of that year.", u'By the end of 1945, Austria, under the supervision of the Allied Council in Vienna, had a democratic parliament and government again, acknowledged by all four allied occupation zones.', u'The Austrian resistance to the Nazi rule started with the Anschluss in 1938.', u'Historians estimate that there were about 100,000 members of resistance facing 700,000 NSDAP members in Austria.', u'The sign of the Austrian resistance was O5, where the 5 stands for E and OE is the abbreviation of \xd6sterreich with \xd6 as OE.', u'=== Republic of Austria (1955 to present) ===\n\nThe end of World War II in 1945 saw the re-establishment of an independent Austria, although the Allied Powers remained in occupation until 1955, when the Austrian State Treaty between Austria and them was signed to end occupation and to regain Austrian sovereignty.', u'Immediately after 1945 the majority of Austrians still saw themselves as Germans, as a broader Austrian national identity took time to develop.', u'In contrast, the Austrian political elite referred to their experiences in concentration camps and in prison, which had brought out a desire for the lost independence of the Austrian state.', u'Kreissler (1993) writes: \u201cIt was not until after the (long dark) night of the Third Reich that Austrian identity was brought back to consciousness by resistance and exile\u201d.', u'Austrians developed a self-image unambiguously separate from their German neighbour.', u'It was based on cultural achievements of the past, the Moscow Declaration, geopolitical neutrality, language variation, the Habsburg legacy, and the separation of the two empires in the late 19th century.', u'The German Empire was formed without Austria and the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the arrangement known as the Kleindeutsche L\xf6sung or "the Little Germany Solution".', u'It proved favourable for Austrians not to be held guilty for World War II, genocide and war crimes, since Austria was considered a victim of Nazi Germany (although some historians call this a "big lie").', u'Unlike earlier in the 20th century, in 1987 only 6 percent of Austrians identified themselves as "Germans".', u'Today over 90 percent of the Austrians see themselves as an independent nation.', u'The logic of the existence of an independent Austrian state is no longer questioned as it was in the inter-war period.', u'Proponents who recognize Austrians as a nation claim that Austrians have Celtic heritage, as Austria is the location of the first characteristically Celtic culture to exist.', u'It is said that Celtic Austria became culturally Romanized under Roman rule and later culturally Germanized after Germanic invasions.', u'Contemporary Austrians express pride in having Celtic heritage and Austria possesses one of the largest collections of Celtic artifacts in Europe.', u"Austria's multicultural history and geographical location has resulted in post-Soviet era immigration from Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania, and Poland.", u'As with neighbouring Germany, there has also been heavy immigration from Turkey and former Yugoslav states such as Croatia and Serbia.', u'Today, the largest group of immigrants are Germans.', u'== Language ==\n\nAustrians have historically spoken the German language.', u'The sole official language on federal of Austria is German, and the standard used is called Austrian German since German is considered a pluricentric language, like English.', u'Austrian German is defined by the Austrian Dictionary (German: \xd6sterreichisches W\xf6rterbuch), published under the authority of the Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture.', u'Thus, all websites, official announcements and most of the media are carried out in Austrian German.', u'The minority languages Slovene, Croatian and Hungarian are spoken and officially recognized.', u'In terms of native language, it is generally not Austrian German that is used, but instead local dialects of the Austro-Bavarian and Allemannic (in Vorarlberg and the Tiroler Au\xdferfern) family.', u'The Austro-Bavarian dialects are considered to belong either to the Central Austro-Bavarian or Southern Austro-Bavarian subgroups, with the latter encompassing the languages of the Tyrol, Carinthia, and Styria and the former including the dialects of Vienna, Upper Austria, and Lower Austria.', u'The vast majority of Austrians are however able to speak Austrian Standard German in addition to their native dialect, as it is taught in all modern day schools.', u'== Naturalization ==\n\nLike all of Western Europe, Austria has had high levels of immigration since the 1970s.', u'As with Germany, the largest immigrant group are Turks.', u'An estimated total of 350,000 ethnic Turks lived in Austria in 2010, accounting for 3% of the Austrian population.', u'The rate of naturalization has increased after 1995, since which dates Turks in Austria could retain their citizenship in Turkey after naturalization in Austria (dual citizenship).', u'After 2007, the rate of naturalizations has decreased due to a stricter nationality law enacted by the Austrian legislature.', u'During the 2000s, an average number of 27,127 foreign nationals per year was naturalized as Austrian citizens, compared to an average 67,688 children per year born with Austrian nationality.', u'Consequently, an increasing portion of Austrians is not descended from the historical populations of Austria.', u'While the term "ethnic Austrian" has mostly been reserved for the context of overseas emigration from Austria (Austrian Americans, Austrian Canadians etc.', u'), it can more recently also be used to distinguish the indigenous population from the naturalized immigrant population.', u'Thus, the rapid growth of Islam in Austria is due to the higher birth rate among immigrants compared to that among the indigenous "ethnic Austrian" population.', u'== Culture ==\n\nAustrian culture has largely been influenced by its neighbours Germany, Italy, Hungary and Bohemia and Czech lands.', u'=== Music ===\n\nVienna, the capital city of Austria has long been an important center of musical innovation.', u'Composers of the 18th and 19th centuries were drawn to the city by the patronage of the Habsburgs, and made Vienna the European capital of classical music.', u'Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Franz Schubert and Johann Strauss, Jr., among others, were associated with the city.', u'During the Baroque period, Slavic and Hungarian folk forms influenced Austrian music.', u'=== Literature ===\n\nComplementing its status as a land of artists, Austria has always been a country of great poets, writers, and novelists.', u'It was the home of novelists Arthur Schnitzler, Stefan Zweig, Thomas Bernhard, and Robert Musil, and of poets Georg Trakl, Franz Werfel, Franz Grillparzer, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Adalbert Stifter.', u'Famous contemporary Austrian playwrights and novelists include Elfriede Jelinek and Peter Handke.', u'Writers of philosophy include Ernst Mach, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Karl Popper and the members of the Vienna circle.', u'=== Cuisine ===\n\nAustrian cuisine, which is often incorrectly equated with Viennese cuisine, is derived from the cuisine of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.', u'In addition to native regional traditions it has been influenced above all by German, Hungarian, Czech, Jewish, Italian and Polish cuisines, from which both dishes and methods of food preparation have often been borrowed.', u'Goulash is one example of this.', u'Austrian cuisine is known primarily in the rest of the world for its pastries and sweets.', u'=== Religion ===\n\nThe majority of Austrians are traditionally Roman Catholic.', u'Roman Catholicism in Austria has played a significant role both in the culture and in the politics of Austria.', u"It enabled the House of Habsburg to rule Spain and its empire as a Catholic Monarchy from the 16th century, and it determined the role of Habsburg Austria in the Thirty Years' War.", u"The music in the tradition of Viennese classicism is sacral to a significant extent, including works such as Mozart's Great Mass in C minor, masses by Joseph Haydn (1750-1802), Beethoven's Mass in C major (1807), down to Bruckner's Te Deum (1903).", u'Secularism has been on the rise since the 1980s.', u'An estimated 66% of Austrians adhered to Roman Catholicism in 2009, compared to 78% in 1991 and 89% in 1961.', u'There is a traditional Lutheran minority, accounting for 4% of the population in 2009 (down from 6% in 1961).', u'An estimated 17% are nonreligious (as of 2005).', u'Islam in Austria has grown rapidly during the 1990s and 2000s, rising from 0.8% in 1971 to an estimated 6% in 2010, overtaking the traditional size of the Lutheran community in Austria.', u'This rapid growth was due to the significant immigration to Austria from Turkey and Former Yugoslavia during the 1990s to 2000s.', u'== See also ==\n\nAustrian American\nAustrian Canadians\nAustrian Brazilian\nAustro-Bavarian\nList of Austrians\nDemographics of Austria\nGermanic peoples\nGerman

{'sentences': [u'Japan (Japanese: \u65e5\u672c Nippon [nip\u031ap\xf5\u031e\u0274] or Nihon [nih\xf5\u031e\u0274]; formally \u65e5\u672c\u56fd  Nippon-koku or Nihon-koku, "State of Japan") is an island country in East Asia.', u'Located in the Pacific Ocean, it lies to the east of the Sea of Japan, the East China Sea, China, Korea and Russia, stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Taiwan in the southwest.', u'The kanji that make up Japan\'s name mean "sun origin", and it is often called the "Land of the Rising Sun".', u'Japan is a stratovolcanic archipelago of 6,852 islands.', u"The four largest are Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu and Shikoku, which make up about ninety-seven percent of Japan's land area.", u'The country is divided into 47 prefectures in eight regions.', u"The population of 127 million is the world's tenth largest.", u"Japanese people make up 98.5% of Japan's total population.", u'Approximately 9.1 million people live in the core city of Tokyo, the capital of Japan.', u'Archaeological research indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period.', u'The first written mention of Japan is in Chinese history texts from the 1st century AD.', u"Influence from other regions, mainly China, followed by periods of isolation, particularly from Western Europe, has characterized Japan's history.", u'From the 12th century until 1868, Japan was ruled by successive feudal military shoguns who ruled in the name of the Emperor.', u'Japan entered into a long period of isolation in the early 17th century, which was ended in 1853 when a United States fleet pressured Japan to open to the West.', u'After nearly two decades of internal conflict and insurrection, the Imperial Court regained its political power in 1868 through the help of several clans from Ch\u014dsh\u016b and Satsuma, and the Empire of Japan was established.', u'In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, victories in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War and World War I allowed Japan to expand its empire during a period of increasing militarism.', u'The Second Sino-Japanese War of 1937 expanded into part of World War II in 1941, which came to an end in 1945 following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.', u'Since adopting its revised constitution in 1947, Japan has maintained a unitary constitutional monarchy with an Emperor and an elected legislature called the National Diet.', u'Japan is a member of the UN, the G7, the G8, and the G20 and is considered a great power.', u"The country has the world's third-largest economy by nominal GDP and the world's fourth-largest economy by purchasing power parity.", u"It is also the world's fourth-largest exporter and fourth-largest importer.", u'The country benefits from a highly skilled workforce and is among the most educated countries in the world with the one of the highest percentage of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree.', u"Although Japan has officially renounced its right to declare war, it maintains a modern military with the world's eighth largest military budget, used for self-defense and peacekeeping roles.", u'Japan is a developed country with a very high standard of living and Human Development Index whose population enjoys the highest life expectancy and the third lowest infant mortality in the world.', u'== Etymology ==\n\nThe Japanese word for Japan is \u65e5\u672c, which is pronounced Nippon or Nihon.', u'The English word Japan possibly derives from the historical Chinese pronunciation of \u65e5\u672c.', u'The Old Mandarin or possibly early Wu Chinese pronunciation of Japan was recorded by Marco Polo as Cipangu.', u'In modern Shanghainese, a Wu dialect, the pronunciation of characters \u65e5\u672c Japan is Zeppen [z\u0259\u0294p\u0259n].', u'The old Malay word for Japan, Jepang, was borrowed from a southern coastal Chinese dialect, probably Fukienese or Ningpo, and this Malay word was encountered by Portuguese traders in Malacca in the 16th century.', u'Early Portuguese traders then brought the word to Europe.', u'An early record of the word in English is in a 1565 letter, spelled Giapan.', u'From the Meiji Restoration until the end of World War II, the full title of Japan was Dai Nippon Teikoku (\u5927\u65e5\u672c\u5e1d\u570b), meaning "the Empire of Great Japan".', u'Today the name Nippon-koku / Nihon-koku (\u65e5\u672c\u56fd) is used as a formal modern-day equivalent simply meaning "the State of Japan"; countries like Japan whose long form does not contain a descriptive designation are generally given a name appended by the character koku (\u56fd), meaning "country", "nation" or "state".', u'The character nichi (\u65e5) means "sun" or "day"; hon (\u672c) means "base" or "origin".', u'The compound means "origin of the sun" or "sunrise", and is the source of the popular Western epithet "Land of the Rising Sun".', u'== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory and ancient history ===\n\nA Paleolithic culture around 30,000 BC constitutes the first known habitation of the Japanese archipelago.', u'This was followed from around 14,000 BC (the start of the J\u014dmon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture, who include ancestors of both the contemporary Ainu people and Yamato people, characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture.', u'Decorated clay vessels from this period are some of the oldest surviving examples of pottery in the world.', u'Around 300 BC, the Yayoi people began to enter the Japanese islands, intermingling with the J\u014dmon.', u'The Yayoi period, starting around 500 BC, saw the introduction of practices like wet-rice farming, a new style of pottery, and metallurgy, introduced from China and Korea.', u'Japan first appears in written history in the Chinese Book of Han.', u'According to the Records of the Three Kingdoms, the most powerful kingdom on the archipelago during the 3rd century was called Yamataikoku.', u'Buddhism was first introduced to Japan from Baekje, Korea and was promoted by Prince Sh\u014dtoku, but the subsequent development of Japanese Buddhism was primarily influenced by China.', u'Despite early resistance, Buddhism was promoted by the ruling class and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the Asuka period (592\u2013710).', u'The Nara period (710\u2013784) of the 8th century marked an emergence of the centralized Japanese state centered on the Imperial Court in Heij\u014d-ky\u014d (modern Nara).', u'The Nara period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent literature as well as the development of Buddhist-inspired art and architecture.', u"The smallpox epidemic of 735\u2013737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of Japan's population.", u'In 784, Emperor Kanmu moved the capital from Nara to Nagaoka-ky\u014d before relocating it to Heian-ky\u014d (modern Kyoto) in 794.', u'This marked the beginning of the Heian period (794\u20131185), during which a distinctly indigenous Japanese culture emerged, noted for its art, poetry and prose.', u'Murasaki Shikibu\'s The Tale of Genji and the lyrics of Japan\'s national anthem "Kimigayo" were written during this time.', u'Buddhism began to spread during the Heian era chiefly through two major sects, Tendai by Saich\u014d, and Shingon by K\u016bkai.', u'Pure Land Buddhism (J\u014ddo-sh\u016b, J\u014ddo Shinsh\u016b) became greatly popular in the latter half of the 11th century.', u"=== Feudal era ===\n\nJapan's feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors, the samurai.", u'In 1185, following the defeat of the Taira clan in the Genpei War, sung in the epic Tale of Heike, samurai Minamoto no Yoritomo was appointed shogun by Emperor Go-Toba, and he established a base of power in Kamakura.', u'After his death, the H\u014dj\u014d clan came to power as regents for the shoguns.', u'The Zen school of Buddhism was introduced from China in the Kamakura period (1185\u20131333) and became popular among the samurai class.', u'The Kamakura shogunate repelled Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281, but was eventually overthrown by Emperor Go-Daigo.', u'Emperor Go-Daigo was himself defeated by Ashikaga Takauji in 1336.', u'Ashikaga Takauji established the shogunate in Muromachi, Kyoto.', u'This was the start of the Muromachi period (1336\u20131573).', u'The Ashikaga shogunate achieved glory in the age of Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, and the culture based on Zen Buddhism (art of Miyabi) prospered.', u'This evolved to Higashiyama Culture, and prospered until the 16th century.', u'On the other hand, the succeeding Ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords (daimyo), and a civil war (the \u014cnin War) began in 1467, opening the century-long Sengoku period ("Warring States").', u'During the 16th century, traders and Jesuit missionaries from Portugal reached Japan for the first time, initiating direct commercial and cultural exchange between Japan and the West.', u'This allowed Oda Nobunaga to obtain European technology and firearms, which he used to conquer many other daimyo.', u'His consolidation of power began what was known as the Azuchi\u2013Momoyama period (1573\u20131603).', u'After he was assassinated in 1582, his successor Toyotomi Hideyoshi unified the nation in 1590 and launched two unsuccessful invasions of Korea in 1592 and 1597.', u"Tokugawa Ieyasu served as regent for Hideyoshi's son and used his position to gain political and military support.", u'When open war broke out, he defeated rival clans in the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600.', u'Tokugawa Ieyasu was appointed shogun by Emperor Go-Y\u014dzei in 1603, and he established the Tokugawa shogunate in Edo (modern Tokyo).', u'The Tokugawa shogunate enacted measures including buke shohatto, as a code of conduct to control the autonomous daimyo; and in 1639, the isolationist sakoku ("closed country") policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the Edo period (1603\u20131868).', u'The study of Western sciences, known as rangaku, continued through contact with the Dutch enclave at Dejima in Nagasaki.', u'The Edo period also gave rise to kokugaku ("national studies"), the study of Japan by the Japanese.', u'=== Modern era ===\n\nOn March 31, 1854, Commodore Matthew Perry and the "Black Ships" of the United States Navy forced the opening of Japan to the outside world with the Convention of Kanagawa.', u'Subsequent similar treaties with Western countries in the Bakumatsu period brought economic and political crises.', u'The resignation of the shogun led to the Boshin War and the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the Emperor (the Meiji Restoration).', u'Adopting Western political, judicial and military institutions, the Cabinet organized the Privy Council, introduced the Meiji Constitution, and assembled the Imperial Diet.', u'The Meiji Restoration transformed the Empire of Japan into an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence.', u'After victories in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894\u20131895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u20131905), Japan gained control of Taiwan, Korea, and the southern half of Sakhalin.', u"Japan's population grew from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million in 1935.", u'World War I enabled Japan, on the side of the victorious Allies, to widen its influence and territorial holdings in Asia.', u'The early 20th century saw a brief period of "Taish\u014d democracy (1912\u20131926)" but the 1920s saw a fragile democracy buckle under a political shift towards fascism, the passing of laws against political dissent and a series of attempted coups.', u'The subsequent "Sh\u014dwa period" initially saw the power of the military increased and brought about Japanese expansionism and militarization along with the totalitarianism and ultranationalism that are a part of fascist ideology.', u'In 1931 Japan invaded and occupied Manchuria and following international condemnation of this occupation, Japan resigned from the League of Nations in 1933.', u'In 1936, Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Germany, and the 1940 Tripartite Pact made it one of the Axis Powers.', u'In 1941, following its defeat in the brief Soviet\u2013Japanese Border War, Japan negotiated the Soviet\u2013Japanese Neutrality Pact, which lasted until 1945 with the Soviet invasion of Manchuria.', u'The Empire of Japan invaded other parts of China in 1937, precipitating the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945).', u'The Imperial Japanese Army swiftly captured the capital Nanjing and conducted the Nanking Massacre.', u'In 1940, the Empire then invaded French Indochina, after which the United States placed an oil embargo on Japan.', u'On December 7\u20138, 1941, Japanese forces carried out surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor, British forces in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong and declared war on the United States and the British Empire, bringing the US and the UK into World War II in the Pacific.', u'After Allied victories across the Pacific during the next four years, which culminated in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, Japan agreed to an unconditional surrender on August 15.', u"The war cost Japan, its colonies, China and the war's other combatants tens of millions of lives and left much of Japan's industry and infrastructure destroyed.", u'The Allies (led by the US) repatriated millions of ethnic Japanese from colonies and military camps throughout Asia, largely eliminating the Japanese empire and restoring the independence of its conquered territories.', u'The Allies also convened the International Military Tribunal for the Far East on May 3, 1946 to prosecute some Japanese leaders for war crimes.', u'However, the bacteriological research units and members of the imperial family involved in the war were exonerated from criminal prosecutions by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers despite calls for the trial of both groups.', u'In 1947, Japan adopted a new constitution emphasizing liberal democratic practices.', u'The Allied occupation ended with the Treaty of San Francisco in 1952 and Japan was granted membership in the United Nations in 1956.', u'Japan later achieved rapid growth to become the second-largest economy in the world, until surpassed by China in 2010.', u'This ended in the mid-1990s when Japan suffered a major recession.', u'In the beginning of the 21st century, positive growth has signaled a gradual economic recovery.', u'On March 11, 2011, Japan suffered the strongest earthquake in its recorded history; this triggered the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, one of the worst disasters in the history of nuclear power.', u'== Geography ==\n\nJapan has a total of 6,852 islands extending along the Pacific coast of East Asia.', u'The country, including all of the islands it controls, lies between latitudes 24\xb0 and 46\xb0N, and longitudes 122\xb0 and 146\xb0E.', u'The main islands, from north to south, are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu.', u'The Ryukyu Islands, which include Okinawa, are a chain to the south of Kyushu.', u'Together they are often known as the Japanese archipelago.', u'About 73 percent of Japan is forested, mountainous, and unsuitable for agricultural, industrial, or residential use.', u'As a result, the habitable zones, mainly located in coastal areas, have extremely high population densities.', u'Japan is one of the most densely populated countries in the world.', u'The islands of Japan are located in a volcanic zone on the Pacific Ring of Fire.', u'They are primarily the result of large oceanic movements occurring over hundreds of millions of years from the mid-Silurian to the Pleistocene as a result of the subduction of the Philippine Sea Plate beneath the continental Amurian Plate and Okinawa Plate to the south, and subduction of the Pacific Plate under the Okhotsk Plate to the north.', u'The Boso Triple Junction off the coast of Japan is a triple junction where the North American Plate, the Pacific Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate meets.', u'Japan was originally attached to the eastern coast of the Eurasian continent.', u'The subducting plates pulled Japan eastward, opening the Sea of Japan around 15 million years ago.', u'Japan has 108 active volcanoes.', u'During the twentieth century several new volcanoes emerged, including Sh\u014dwa-shinzan on Hokkaido and My\u014djin-sh\u014d off the Bayonnaise Rocks in the Pacific.', u'Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunami, occur several times each century.', u'The 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people.', u'More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake, a 9.0-magnitude quake which hit Japan on March 11, 2011, and triggered a large tsunami.', u'Japan is substantially prone to earthquakes, tsunami and volcanoes due to its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire.', u'It has the 15th highest natural disaster risk as measured in the 2013 World Risk Index.', u'=== Climate ===\n\nThe climate of Japan is predominantly temperate, but varies greatly from north to south.', u"Japan's geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones: Hokkaido, Sea of Japan, Central Highland, Seto Inland Sea, Pacific Ocean, and Ryukyu Islands.", u'The northernmost zone, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers.', u'Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.', u"In the Sea of Japan zone on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall.", u'In the summer, the region is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn.', u'The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter seasons, as well as large diurnal variation; precipitation is light, though winters are usually snowy.', u'The mountains of the Ch\u016bgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.', u'The Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind.', u'The Ryukyu Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers.', u'Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season.', u'The average winter temperature in Japan is 5.1 \xb0C (41.2 \xb0F) and the average summer temperature is 25.2 \xb0C (77.4 \xb0F).', u'The highest temperature ever measured in Japan 40.9 \xb0C (105.6 \xb0F) was recorded on August 16, 2007.', u'The main rainy season begins in early May in Okinawa, and the rain front gradually moves north until reaching Hokkaido in late July.', u'In most of Honshu, the rainy season begins before the middle of June and lasts about six weeks.', u'In late summer and early autumn, typhoons often bring heavy rain.', u'=== Biodiversity ===\n\nJapan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography of the islands.', u'They range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the Ry\u016bky\u016b and Bonin Islands, to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to temperate coniferous forests in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands.', u'Japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife, including the brown bear, the Japanese macaque, the Japanese raccoon dog, the Large Japanese Field Mouse, and the Japanese giant salamander.', u'A large network of national parks has been established to protect important areas of flora and fauna as well as thirty-seven Ramsar wetland sites.', u'Four sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their outstanding natural value.', u'=== Environment ===\n\nIn the period of rapid economic growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s.', u'Responding to rising concern about the problem, the government introduced several environmental protection laws in 1970.', u"The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan's lack of natural resources.", u'Current environmental issues include urban air pollution (NOx, suspended particulate matter, and toxics), waste management, water eutrophication, nature conservation, climate change, chemical management and international co-operation for conservation.', u'As of June 2015, more than 40 coal-fired power plants are planned or under construction in Japan.', u'The NGO Climate Action Network announced Japan as the winner of its "Fossil of the Day" award for "doing the most to block progress on climate action."', u"Japan ranks 39th in the 2016 Environmental Performance Index, which measures a nation's commitment to environmental sustainability.", u'As a signatory of the Kyoto Protocol, and host of the 1997 conference that created it, Japan is under treaty obligation to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps to curb climate change.', u'== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Government ===\n\nJapan is a constitutional monarchy whereby the power of the Emperor is very limited.', u'As a ceremonial figurehead, he is defined by the constitution as "the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people."', u'Power is held chiefly by the Prime Minister and other elected members of the Diet, while sovereignty is vested in the Japanese people.', u'Akihito is the current Emperor of Japan; Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan, stands as next in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne.', u"Japan's legislative organ is the National Diet, seated in Chiyoda, Tokyo.", u'The Diet is a bicameral body, consisting of a House of Representatives with 480 seats, elected by popular vote every four years or when dissolved, and a House of Councillors of 242 seats, whose popularly elected members serve six-year terms.', u'There is universal suffrage for adults over 18 years of age, with a secret ballot for all elected offices.', u'The Diet is dominated by the social liberal Democratic Party of Japan and the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).', u'The LDP has enjoyed near continuous electoral success since 1955, except for a brief 11-month period between 1993 and 1994, and from 2009 to 2012.', u'As of September 2016, it holds 291 seats in the lower house and 122 seats in the upper house.', u'The Prime Minister of Japan is the head of government and is appointed by the Emperor after being designated by the Diet from among its members.', u'The Prime Minister is the head of the Cabinet, and he appoints and dismisses the Ministers of State.', u"Following the LDP's landslide victory in the 2012 general election, Shinz\u014d Abe replaced Yoshihiko Noda as the Prime Minister on December 26, 2012 and became the country's sixth prime minister to be sworn in during a span of six years.", u'Although the Prime Minister is formally appointed by the Emperor, the Constitution of Japan explicitly requires the Emperor to appoint whoever is designated by the Diet.', u'Historically influenced by Chinese law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during the Edo period through texts such as Kujikata Osadamegaki.', u'However, since the late 19th century the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law of Europe, notably Germany.', u'For example, in 1896, the Japanese government established a civil code based on a draft of the German B\xfcrgerliches Gesetzbuch; with the code remaining in effect with post\u2013World War II modifications.', u"Statutory law originates in Japan's legislature and has the rubber stamp of the Emperor.", u'The Constitution requires that the Emperor promulgate legislation passed by the Diet, without specifically giving him the power to oppose legislation.', u"Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the Supreme Court and three levels of lower courts.", u'The main body of Japanese statutory law is called the Six Codes.', u'=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nJapan consists of 47 prefectures, each overseen by an elected governor, legislature and administrative bureaucracy.', u'Each prefecture is further divided into cities, towns and villages.', u'The nation is currently undergoing administrative reorganization by merging many of the cities, towns and villages with each other.', u'This process will reduce the number of sub-prefecture administrative regions and is expected to cut administrative costs.', u'=== Foreign relations ===\n\nJapan has diplomatic relations with nearly all independent nations and has been an active member of the UN since December 1956.', u'Japan is a member of the G8, APEC, and "ASEAN Plus Three", and is a participant in the East Asia Summit.', u'Japan signed a security pact with Australia in March 2007 and with India in October 2008.', u"It is the world's fifth largest donor of official development assistance, donating US$9.2 billion in 2014.", u'Japan has close ties to the United States.', u"Since Japan's defeat by the United States in World War II, the two countries have maintained close economic and defense relations.", u'The United States is a major market for Japanese exports and the primary source of Japanese imports, and is committed to defending the country, having military bases in Japan for that purpose.', u"Japan contests Russia's control of the Southern Kuril Islands (including Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan, and the Habomai group) which were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1945.", u'South Korea\'s assertions concerning Liancourt Rocks (Japanese: "Takeshima", Korean: "Dokdo") are acknowledged, but not accepted by Japan.', u"Japan has strained relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (Taiwan) over the Senkaku Islands; and with the People's Republic of China over the status of Okinotorishima.", u"Japan's relationship with South Korea has been strained due to Japan's treatment of Koreans during Japanese colonial rule, particularly over the issue of comfort women.", u'However, in December 2015, Japan and South Korea agreed to settle the issue with Japan issuing a formal apology and taking responsibility for the issue and paying money to the surviving comfort women.', u'== Military ==\n\nJapan maintains one of the largest military budgets of any country in the world.', u"The country's military (the Japan Self-Defense Forces) is restricted by Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounces Japan's right to declare war or use military force in international disputes.", u"Accordingly, Japan's Self-Defence force is an unusual military that has never fired shots outside Japan.", u'Japan is the highest-ranked Asian country in the Global Peace Index.', u'The military is governed by the Ministry of Defense, and primarily consists of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF), the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF).', u'The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) is a regular participant in RIMPAC maritime exercises.', u"The forces have been recently used in peacekeeping operations; the deployment of troops to Iraq marked the first overseas use of Japan's military since World War II.", u'Japan Business Federation has called on the government to lift the ban on arms exports so that Japan can join multinational projects such as the Joint Strike Fighter.', u'The 21st century is witnessing a rapid change in global power balance along with globalization.', u'The security environment around Japan has become increasingly severe as represented by nuclear and missile development by North Korea.', u'Transnational threats grounded on technological progress including international terrorism and cyber attacks are also increasing their significance.', u'Japan, including its Self Defense Forces, has contributed to the maximum extent possible to the efforts to maintain and restore international peace and security, such as UN peacekeeping operations.', u'Building on the ongoing efforts as a peaceful state, the Government of Japan has been making various efforts on its security policy which include: the establishment of the National Security Council (NSC), the adoption of the National Security Strategy (NSS), and the National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG).', u'These efforts are made based on the belief that Japan, as a "Proactive Contributor to Peace", needs to contribute more actively to the peace and stability of the region and the international community, while coordinating with other countries including its ally, the United States.', u"Japan has close economic and military relations with the United States; the US-Japan security alliance acts as the cornerstone of the nation's foreign policy.", u'A member state of the United Nations since 1956, Japan has served as a non-permanent Security Council member for a total of 20 years, most recently for 2009 and 2010.', u'It is one of the G4 nations seeking permanent membership in the Security Council.', u'In May 2014, Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe said Japan wanted to shed the passiveness it has maintained since the end of World War II and take more responsibility for regional security.', u"He said Japan wanted to play a key role and offered neighboring countries Japan's support.", u'In recent years, they have been engaged in international peacekeeping operations including the UN peacekeeping.', u'Recent tensions, particularly with North Korea, have reignited the debate over the status of the JSDF and its relation to Japanese society.', u'New military guidelines, announced in December 2010, will direct the JSDF away from its Cold War focus on the former Soviet Union to a focus on China, especially regarding the territorial dispute over the Senkaku Islands.', u'== Economy ==\n\nJapan is the third largest national economy in the world, after the United States and China, in terms of nominal GDP, and the fourth largest national economy in the world, after the United States, China and India, in terms of purchasing power parity.', u"As of 2014, Japan's public debt was estimated at more than 200 percent of its annual gross domestic product, the largest of any nation in the world.", u"In August 2011, Moody's rating has cut Japan's long-term sovereign debt rating one notch from Aa3 to Aa2 inline with the size of the country's deficit and borrowing level.", u'The large budget deficits and government debt since the 2009 global recession and followed by the earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 caused the rating downgrade.', u'The service sector accounts for three quarters of the gross domestic product.', u'Japan has a large industrial capacity, and is home to some of the largest and most technologically advanced producers of motor vehicles, electronics, machine tools, steel and nonferrous metals, ships, chemical substances, textiles, and processed foods.', u"Agricultural businesses in Japan cultivate 13 percent of Japan's land, and Japan accounts for nearly 15 percent of the global fish catch, second only to China.", u"As of 2010, Japan's labor force consisted of some 65.9 million workers.",

of capitalism has many distinct features: keiretsu enterprises are influential, and lifetime employment and seniority-based career advancement are relatively common in the Japanese work environment.', u'Japanese companies are known for management methods like "The Toyota Way", and shareholder activism is rare.', u"=== Economic history ===\nModern Japan's economic growth began in the Edo period.", u'Some of the surviving elements of the Edo period are roads and water transportation routes, as well as financial instruments such as futures contracts, banking and insurance of the Osaka rice brokers.', u'During the Meiji period from 1868, Japan expanded economically with the embrace of the market economy.', u"Many of today's enterprises were founded at the time, and Japan emerged as the most developed nation in Asia.", u'The period of overall real economic growth from the 1960s to the 1980s has been called the Japanese post-war economic miracle: it averaged 7.5 percent in the 1960s and 1970s, and 3.2 percent in the 1980s and early 1990s.', u'Growth slowed in the 1990s during the "Lost Decade" due to after-effects of the Japanese asset price bubble and government policies intended to wring speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets.', u'Efforts to revive economic growth were unsuccessful and further hampered by the global slowdown in 2000.', u'The economy recovered after 2005; GDP growth for that year was 2.8 percent, surpassing the growth rates of the US and European Union during the same period.', u'Today Japan ranks highly for competitiveness and economic freedom.', u'It is ranked sixth in the Global Competitiveness Report for 2015\u20132016.', u"=== Agriculture and fishery ===\n\nThe Japanese agricultural sector accounts for about 1.4% of the total country's GDP.", u"Only 12% of Japan's land is suitable for cultivation.", u'Due to this lack of arable land, a system of terraces is used to farm in small areas.', u"This results in one of the world's highest levels of crop yields per unit area, with an overall agricultural self-sufficiency rate of about 50% on fewer than 56,000 square kilometres (14,000,000 acres) cultivated.", u"Japan's small agricultural sector, however, is also highly subsidized and protected, with government regulations that favor small-scale cultivation instead of large-scale agriculture as practiced in North America.", u'There has been a growing concern about farming as the current farmers are aging with a difficult time finding successors.', u"Rice accounts for almost all of Japan's cereal production.", u'Japan is the second-largest agricultural product importer in the world.', u'Rice, the most protected crop, is subject to tariffs of 777.7%.', u'In 1996, Japan ranked fourth in

fish.", u"Offshore fisheries accounted for an average of 50% of the nation's total fish catches in the late 1980s although they experienced repeated ups and downs during that period.", u"Today, Japan maintains one of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch, prompting some claims that Japan's fishing is leading to depletion in fish stocks such as tuna.", u'Japan has also sparked controversy by supporting quasi-commercial whaling.', u"=== Industry ===\n\nJapan's industrial sector makes up approximately 27.5% of its GDP.", u"Japan's major industries are motor vehicles, electronics, machine tools, metals, ships, chemicals and processed foods; some major Japanese industrial companies include Toyota, Canon Inc., Toshiba and Nippon Steel.", u"Japan is the third largest automobile producer in the world, and is home to Toyota, the world's largest automobile company.", u'The Japanese consumer electronics industry, once considered the strongest in the world, is currently in a state of decline as competition arises in countries like South Korea, the United States and China.', u'However, despite also facing similar competition from South Korea and China, the Japanese shipbuilding industry is expected to remain strong thanks to an increased focus on specialized, high-tech designs.', u"=== Services ===\n\nJapan's service sector accounts for about three-quarters of its total economic output.", u'Banking, insurance, real estate, retailing, transportation, and telecommunications are all major industries, with companies such as Mitsubishi UFJ,

technology ==\n\nJapan is a leading nation in scientific research, particularly in fields related to the natural sciences and engineering.', u'The country ranks second among the most innovative countries in the Bloomberg Innovation Index.', u'Nearly 700,000 researchers share a US$130 billion research and development budget.', u'The amount spent on research and development relative to its gross domestic product third highest in the world.', u'The country is a world leader in fundamental scientific research, having produced twenty-two Nobel laureates in either physics, chemistry or medicine, and three Fields medalists.', u'Japanese scientists and engineers have contributed to the advancement of agricultural sciences, electronics, industrial robotics, optics, chemicals, semiconductors, life sciences and various fields of engineering.', u"Japan leads the world in robotics production and use, possessing more than 20% (300,000 of 1.3 million) of the world's industrial robots as of 2013\u2014though its share was historically even higher, representing one-half of all industrial robots worldwide in 2000.", u'Japan boasts the third highest number of scientists, technicians, and engineers per capita in the world with 83 scientists, technicians, and engineers per 10,000 employees.', u"=== Electronics and automotive engineering ===\n\nThe Japanese electronics

other countries.", u'Brands such as Fujifilm, Sony, Panasonic, Toyota, Nissan, and Honda are internationally famous.', u"It's estimated that 16% of the world's gold and 22% of the world's silver is contained in electronic technology in Japan.", u"Japan has started a project to build the world's fastest supercomputer by the end of 2017.", u"=== Aerospace ===\n\nThe Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) is Japan's space agency; it conducts space, planetary, and aviation research, and leads development of rockets and satellites.", u'It is a participant in the International Space Station: the Japanese Experiment Module (Kibo) was added to the station during Space Shuttle assembly flights in 2008.', u"Japan's plans in space exploration include: launching a space probe to Venus, Akatsuki; developing the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter to be launched in 2016; and building a moon base by 2030.", u'On September 14, 2007, it launched lunar explorer SELENE (Selenological and Engineering Explorer) on an H-IIA (Model H2A2022) carrier rocket from Tanegashima Space Center.', u'SELENE is also known as Kaguya, after the lunar princess of The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter.', u'Kaguya is the largest lunar mission since the Apollo program.', u"Its purpose is to gather data on the moon's origin and evolution.", u'It entered a lunar orbit on October 4, flying at an altitude of about 100 km (62 mi).', u"The probe's mission was ended when it was deliberately crashed by JAXA into the Moon on June 11, 2009.", u'=== Nobel laureates ===\n\nJapan has received the most science Nobel prizes in Asia and ranked 8th in the world.', u'Japanese researchers have won several Nobel prizes.', u'Hideki Yukawa, educated at Kyoto University, was awarded the prize for physics in 1949.', u'Sin-Itiro Tomonaga followed in 1965.', u'Solid-state physicist Leo Esaki, educated at the University of Tokyo, received the prize in 1973.', u"Kenichi Fukui of Kyoto University shared the 1981 chemistry prize, and Susumu Tonegawa, also educated at Kyoto University, became Japan's first (and, as of 2007, only) laureate in physiology or medicine in 1987.", u'Japanese chemists took prizes in 2000 and 2001: first Hideki Shirakawa (Tokyo Institute of Technology) and then Ry\u014dji Noyori (Kyoto University).', u'Masatoshi Koshiba (University of Tokyo) and Koichi Tanaka (Tohoku University) won in physics and chemistry, respectively, in 2002.', u'Makoto Kobayashi, Toshihide Masukawa, and Yoichiro Nambu who is an American citizen when awarded, shared the physics prize and Osamu Shimomura

Medicine was awarded to Yoshinori Ohsumi in 2016.', u"== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nJapan's road spending has been extensive.", u'Its 1.2 million kilometres (0.75 million miles) of paved road are the main means of transportation.', u'As of April 2012 Japan has approximately 1,215,000 kilometres (134,000 miles) of roads made up of 1,022,000 kilometres (14,000 miles) of city, town and village roads, 129,000 kilometres (80,000 miles) of prefectural roads, 55,000 kilometres (34,000 miles) of general national highways and 8,050 kilometres (5,000 miles) of national expressways.', u'The Foreign Press Center/Japan cites a total length of expressways at 7,641 kilometres (4,748 miles) (fiscal 2008).', u'A single network of high-speed, divided, limited-access toll roads connects major cities on Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu.', u'Hokkaido has a separate network, and Okinawa Island has a highway of this type.', u'A single network of high-speed, divided, limited-access toll roads connects major cities and is operated by toll-collecting enterprises.', u'New and used cars are inexpensive; car ownership fees and fuel levies are used to promote energy efficiency.', u'However, at just 50 percent of all distance traveled, car usage is the lowest of all G8 countries.', u'Since privatisation in 1987, dozens of Japanese railway companies compete in regional and local passenger transportation markets; major companies include seven JR enterprises, Kintetsu, Seibu Railway and Keio Corporation.', u'Some 250 high-speed Shinkansen trains connect major cities and Japanese trains are known for their safety and punctuality.', u'Proposals for a new Maglev route between Tokyo and Osaka are at an advanced stage.', u"There are 175 airports in Japan; the largest domestic airport, Haneda Airport, is Asia's second-busiest airport.", u'The largest international gateways are Narita International Airport, Kansai International Airport and Ch\u016bbu Centrair International Airport.', u"Nagoya Port is the country's largest and busiest port, accounting for 10 percent of Japan's trade value.", u'=== Energy ===\n\nAs of 2011, 46.1% of energy in Japan was produced from petroleum, 21.3% from coal, 21.4% from natural gas, 4.0% from nuclear power, and 3.3% from hydropower.', u"Nuclear power produced 9.2 percent of Japan's electricity, as of 2011, down from 24.9 percent the previous year.", u"However, by May 2012 all of the country's nuclear power plants had been taken offline because of ongoing public opposition following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011, though government officials continued to try to sway public opinion in favor of returning at least some of Japan's 50 nuclear reactors to service.", u'As of November 2014, two reactors at Sendai are likely to restart in early 2015.', u'Japan lacks significant domestic reserves and so has a heavy dependence on imported energy.', u'Japan has therefore aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy efficiency.', u'=== Water supply and sanitation ===\n\nThe government took responsibility for regulating the water and sanitation sector is shared between the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in charge of water supply for domestic use; the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism in charge of water resources development as well as sanitation; the Ministry of the Environment in charge of ambient water quality and environmental preservation; and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in charge of performance benchmarking of utilities.', u'Access to an improved water source is universal in Japan.', u'97% of the population receives piped water supply from public utilities and 3% receive water from their own wells or unregulated small systems, mainly in rural areas.', u'Access to improved sanitation is also universal, either through sewers or on-site sanitation.', u'All collected waste water is treated at secondary-level treatment plants.', u'All effluents discharged to closed or semi-closed water bodies, such as Tokyo Bay, Osaka Bay, or Lake Biwa, are further treated to tertiary level.', u'This applies to about 15% of waste water.', u'The effluent quality is remarkably good at 3\u201310 mg/l of BOD for secondary-level treatment, well below the national effluent standard of 20 mg/l.', u'Water supply and sanitation in Japan is facing some challenges, such as a decreasing population, declining investment, fiscal constraints, ageing facilities, an ageing workforce, a fragmentation of service provision among thousands of municipal utilities, and the vulnerability of parts of the country to droughts that are expected to become more frequent due to climate change.', u"== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nJapan's population is estimated at around 127 million, with 80% of the population living on Honsh\u016b.", u'Japanese society is linguistically and culturally homogeneous, composed of 98.5% ethnic Japanese, with small populations of foreign workers.', u'Zainichi Koreans, Chinese, Filipinos, Brazilians mostly of Japanese descent, Peruvians mostly of Japanese descent and Americans are among the small minority groups in Japan.', u'In 2003, there were about 134,700 non-Latin American Western (not including more than 33,000 American military personnel and their dependents stationed throughout the country) and 345,500 Latin American expatriates, 274,700 of whom were Brazilians (said to be primarily Japanese descendants, or nikkeijin, along with their spouses), the largest community of Westerners.', u'The most dominant native ethnic group is the Yamato people; primary minority groups include the indigenous Ainu and Ryukyuan peoples, as well as social minority groups like the burakumin.', u'There are persons of mixed ancestry incorporated among the Yamato, such as those from Ogasawara Archipelago.', u'In 2014, foreign-born non-naturalized workers made up only 1.5% of the total population.', u'Japan is widely regarded as ethnically homogeneous, and does not compile ethnicity or race statistics for Japanese nationals; however, at least one analysis describes Japan as a multiethnic society.', u'Most Japanese continue to see Japan as a monocultural society.', u'Former Japanese Prime Minister and current Finance Minister Tar\u014d As\u014d described Japan as being a nation of "one race, one civilization, one language and one culture", which drew criticism from representatives of ethnic minorities such as the Ainu.', u'Japan has the second longest overall life expectancy at birth of any country in the world: 83.5 years for persons born in the period 2010\u20132015.', u'The Japanese population is rapidly aging as a result of a post\u2013World War II baby boom followed by a decrease in birth rates.', u'In 2012, about 24.1 percent of the population was over 65, and the proportion is projected to rise to almost 40 percent by 2050.', u'=== Religion ===\n\nJapan has full religious freedom based on Article 20 of its Constitution.', u'Upper estimates suggest that 84\u201396 percent of the Japanese population subscribe to Shinto as its indigenous religion (50% to 80% of which considering degrees of syncretism with Buddhism, shinbutsu-sh\u016bg\u014d).', u'However, these estimates are based on people affiliated with a temple, rather than the number of true believers.', u'The number of Shinto shrines in Japan is estimated to be around 100,000.', u'Other studies have suggested that only 30 percent of the population identify themselves as belonging to a religion.', u'According to Edwin Reischauer and Marius Jansen, some 70\u201380% of the Japanese do not consider themselves believers in any religion.', u'Nevertheless, the level of participation remains high, especially during festivals and occasions such as the first shrine visit of the New Year.', u'Taoism and Confucianism from China have also influenced Japanese beliefs and customs.', u'Japanese streets are decorated on Tanabata, Obon and Christmas.', u'Shinto is the largest religion in Japan, practiced by nearly 80% of the population, yet only a small percentage of these identify themselves as "Shintoists" in surveys.', u'This is due to the fact that "Shinto" has different meanings in Japan: most of the Japanese attend Shinto shrines and beseech kami without belonging to Shinto organisations, and since there are no formal rituals to become a member of folk "Shinto", "Shinto membership" is often estimated counting those who join organised Shinto sects.', u'Shinto has 100,000 shrines and 78,890 priests in the country.', u'Buddhism first arrived in Japan in the 6th century; it was introduced in the year 538 or 552 from the kingdom of Baekje in Korea.', u'Christianity was first introduced into Japan by Jesuit missions starting in 1549.', u'Today, fewer than 1% to 2.3% are Christians.', u"Most of them living in the western part of the country, where the missionaries' activities were greatest during the 16th century.", u'Nagasaki Prefecture has the highest percentage of Christians: about 5.1% in 1996.', u'As of 2007 there are 32,036 Christian priests and pastors in Japan.', u"Throughout the latest century, some Western customs originally related to Christianity (including Western style weddings, Valentine's Day and Christmas) have become popular as secular customs among many Japanese.", u'Islam in Japan is mostly represented by small immigrant communities from other parts of Asia.', u'In 2008, Keiko Sakurai estimated that 80\u201390% of the Muslims in Japan were foreign born migrants primarily from Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Iran.', u'It has been estimated that the Muslim immigrant population amounts to 70,000\u2013100,000 people, while the "estimated number of Japanese Muslims ranges from thousands to tens of thousands".', u'Other minority religions include Hinduism, Sikhism, and Judaism, and since the mid-19th century numerous new religious movements have emerged in Japan.', u'=== Languages ===\n\nMore than 99 percent of the population speaks Japanese as their first language.', u'Japanese is an agglutinative language distinguished by a system of honorifics reflecting the hierarchical nature of Japanese society, with verb forms and particular vocabulary indicating the relative status of speaker and listener.', u'Japanese writing uses kanji (Chinese characters) and two sets of kana (syllabaries based on cursive script and radical of kanji), as well as the Latin alphabet and Arabic numerals.', u'Besides Japanese, the Ryukyuan languages (Amami, Kunigami, Okinawan, Miyako, Yaeyama, Yonaguni), also part of the Japonic language family, are spoken in the Ryukyu Islands chain.', u'Few children learn these languages, but in recent years the local governments have sought to increase awareness of the traditional languages.', u'The Okinawan Japanese dialect is also spoken in the region.', u'The Ainu language, which has no proven relationship to Japanese or any other language, is moribund, with only a few elderly native speakers remaining in Hokkaido.', u'Public and private schools generally require students to take Japanese language classes as well as English language courses.', u'=== Problems ===\nThe changes in demographic structure have created a number of social issues, particularly a potential decline in workforce population and increase in the cost of social security benefits like the public pension plan.', u'A growing number of younger Japanese are not marrying or remain childless.', u"In 2011, Japan's population dropped for a fifth year, falling by 204,000 people to 126.24 million people.", u'This was the greatest decline since at least 1947, when comparable figures were first compiled.', u'This decline was made worse by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, which killed nearly 16,000 people with approximately another 2,600 still listed as missing as of 2014.', u"Japan's population is expected to drop to 95 million by 2050; demographers and government planners are currently in a heated debate over how to cope with this problem.", u"Immigration and birth incentives are sometimes suggested as a solution to provide younger workers to support the nation's aging population.", u'Japan accepts a steady flow of 15,000 new Japanese citizens by naturalization (\u5e30\u5316) per year.', u'According to the UNHCR, in 2012 Japan accepted just 18 refugees for resettlement, while the US took in 76,000.', u'Japan suffers from a high suicide rate.', u'In 2009, the number of suicides exceeded 30,000 for the twelfth straight year.', u'Suicide is the leading cause of death for people under 30.', u'== Education ==\n\nPrimary schools, secondary schools and universities were introduced in 1872 as a result of the Meiji Restoration.', u'Since 1947, compulsory education in Japan comprises elementary and middle school, which together last for nine years (from age 6 to age 15).', u'Almost all children continue their education at a three-year senior high school.', u"Japan's education system played a central part in the country's recovery and rapid economic growth in the decades following the end of World War II.", u'After World War II, the Fundamental Law of Education and the School Education Law were enacted.', u'The latter law defined the school system that would be in effect for many decades: six years of elementary school, three years of junior high school, three years of high school, and two or four years of university.', u'Starting in April 2016, various schools began the academic year with elementary school and junior high school integrated into one nine-year compulsory schooling program, in hopes to mitigate bullying and truancy; MEXT plans for this approach to be adopted nationwide in the coming years.', u'In Japan, having a strong educational background greatly improves the likelihood of finding a job and earning enough money to support oneself.', u'Highly educated individuals are less affected by unemployment trends as higher levels of educational attainment make an individual more attractive in the workforce.', u'The lifetime earnings also increase with each level of education attained.', u"Furthermore, skills needed in the modern 21st century labor market are becoming more knowledge-based and strong aptitude in science and mathematics are more strong predictors of employment prospects in Japan's highly technological economy.", u'Japan is one of the top-performing OECD countries in reading literacy, maths and sciences with the average student scoring 540 and has one of the worlds highest-educated labor forces among OECD countries.', u"The Japanese populace is well educated and its society highly values education as a platform for social mobility and for gaining employment in the country's competitive high-tech economy.", u"The country's large pool of highly educated and skilled individuals is largely responsible for ushering Japan\u2019s post-war economic growth.", u"Tertiary-educated adults in Japan, particularly graduates in sciences and engineering benefit economically and socially from their education and skills in the country's high tech economy.", u'Spending on education as a proportion of GDP is below the OECD average.', u'Although expenditure per student is comparatively high in Japan, total expenditure relative to GDP remains small.', u'In 2015, Japan\u2019s public spending on education amounted to just 3.5 percent of its GDP, below the OECD average of 4.7%.', u'In 2014, the country ranked fourth for the percentage of 25- to 64-year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 48 percent.', u"In addition, bachelor's degrees are held by 59 percent of Japanese aged 25\u201334, the second most in the OECD after South Korea.", u'As the Japanese economy is largely scientific and technological based, the labor market demands people who have achieved some form of higher education, particularly related to science and engineering in order to gain a competitive edge when searching for employment opportunities.', u'About 75.9 percent of high school graduates attended a university, junior college, trade school, or other higher education institution.', u'The two top-ranking universities in Japan are the University of Tokyo and Kyoto University.', u'The Programme for International Student Assessment coordinated by the OECD currently ranks the overall knowledge and skills of Japanese 15-year-olds as sixth best in the world.', u'== Health ==\n\nIn Japan, health care is provided by national and local governments.', u'Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee.', u'People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments.', u'Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance.', u'Patients are free to select the physicians or facilities of their choice.', u'== Culture ==\n\nJapanese culture has evolved greatly from its origins.', u'Contemporary culture combines influences from Asia, Europe and North America.', u'Traditional Japanese arts include crafts such as ceramics, textiles, lacquerware, swords and dolls; performances of bunraku, kabuki, noh, dance, and rakugo; and other practices, the tea ceremony, ikebana, martial arts, calligraphy, origami, onsen, Geisha and games.', u'Japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of both tangible and intangible Cultural Properties and National Treasures.', u'Nineteen sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, fifteen of which are of cultural significance.', u'=== Architecture ===\n\nJapanese architecture is a combination between local and other influences.', u'It has traditionally been typified by wooden structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs.', u'Sliding doors (fusuma) were used in place of walls, allowing the internal configuration of a space to be customized for different occasions.', u'People usually sat on cushions or otherwise on the floor, traditionally; chairs and high tables were not widely used until the 20th century.', u'Since the 19th century, however, Japan has incorporated much of Western, modern, and post-modern architecture into construction and design, and is today a leader in cutting-edge architectural design and technology.', u'The introduction of Buddhism during the sixth century was a catalyst for large-scale temple building using complicated techniques in wood.', u'Influence from the Chinese Tang and Sui Dynasties led to the foundation of the first permanent capital in Nara.', u"Its checkerboard street layout used the Chinese capital of Chang'an as a template for its design.", u'A gradual increase in the size of buildings led to standard units of measurement as well as refinements in layout and garden design.', u'The introduction of the tea ceremony emphasised simplicity and modest design as a counterpoint to the excesses of the aristocracy.', u'During the Meiji Restoration of 1868 the history of Japanese architecture was radically changed by two important events.', u'The first was the Kami and Buddhas Separation Act of 1868, which formally separated Buddhism from Shinto and Buddhist temples from Shinto shrines, breaking an association between the two which had lasted well over a thousand years.', u'Second, it was then that Japan underwent a period of intense Westernization in order to compete with other developed countries.', u'Initially architects and styles from abroad were imported to Japan but gradually the country taught its own architects and began to express its own style.', u'Architects returning from study with western architects introduced the International Style of modernism into Japan.', u'However, it was not until after the Second World War that Japanese architects made an impression on the international scene, firstly with the work of architects like Kenzo Tange and then with theoretical movements like Metabolism.', u'=== Art ===\n\nThe Shrines of Ise have been celebrated as the prototype of Japanese architecture.', u'Largely of wood, traditional housing and many temple buildings see the use of tatami mats and sliding doors that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space.', u'Japanese sculpture, largely of wood, and Japanese painting are among the oldest of the Japanese arts, with early figurative paintings dating back to at least 300 BC.', u'The history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native Japanese aesthetics and adaptation of imported ideas.', u'The interaction between Japanese and European art has been significant: for example ukiyo-e prints, which began to be exported in the 19th century in the movement known as Japonism, had a significant influence on the development of modern art in the West, most notably on post-Impressionism.', u'Famous ukiyo-e artists include Hokusai and Hiroshige.', u'Hokusai coined the term manga.', u'Japanese comics now known as manga developed in the 20th century and have become popular worldwide.', u'Japanese animation is called anime.', u'Japanese-made video game consoles have been popular since the 1980s.', u'=== Music ===\n\nJapanese music is eclectic and diverse.', u'Many instruments, such as the koto, were introduced in the 9th and 10th centuries.', u'The accompanied recitative of the Noh drama dates from the 14th century and the popular folk music, with the guitar-like shamisen, from the sixteenth.', u'Western classical music, introduced in the late 19th century, now forms an integral part of Japanese culture.', u'The imperial court ensemble Gagaku has influenced the work of some modern Western composers.', u'Notable classical composers from Japan include Toru Takemitsu and Rentar\u014d Taki.', u'Popular music in post-war Japan has been heavily influenced by American and European trends, which has led to the evolution of J-pop, or Japanese popular music.', u'Karaoke is the most widely practiced cultural activity in Japan.', u'A 1993 survey by the Cultural Affairs Agency found that more Japanese had sung karaoke that year than had participated in traditional pursuits such as flower arranging (ikebana) or tea ceremonies.', u"=== Literature ===\n\nThe earliest works of Japanese literature include the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki chronicles and the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b poetry anthology, all from the 8th century and written in Chinese characters.", u'In the early Heian period, the system of phonograms known as kana (Hiragana and Katakana) was developed.', u'The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter is considered the oldest Japanese narrative.', u"An account of Heian court life is given in The Pillow Book by Sei Sh\u014dnagon, while The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu is often described as the world's first novel.", u'During the Edo period, the ch\u014dnin ("townspeople") overtook the samurai aristocracy as producers and consumers of literature.', u'The popularity of the works of Saikaku, for example, reveals this change in readership and authorship, while Bash\u014d revivified the poetic tradition of the Kokinsh\u016b with his haikai (haiku) and wrote the poetic travelogue Oku no Hosomichi.', u'The Meiji era saw the decline of traditional literary forms as Japanese literature integrated Western influences.', u'Natsume S\u014dseki and Mori \u014cgai were the first "modern" novelists of Japan, followed by Ry\u016bnosuke Akutagawa, Jun\'ichir\u014d Tanizaki, Yukio Mishima and, more recently, Haruki Murakami.', u'Japan has two Nobel Prize-winning authors\u2014Yasunari Kawabata (1968) and Kenzabur\u014d \u014ce (1994).', u'=== Philosophy ===\n\nJapanese Philosophy has historically been a fusion of both foreign; particularly Chinese and Western, and uniquely Japanese elements.', u'In its literary forms, Japanese philosophy began about fourteen centuries ago.', u'Archaeological evidence and early historical accounts suggest that Japan was originally an animistic culture, which viewed the world as infused with kami (\u795e) or sacred presence as taught by Shinto, though it is not a philosophy as such, but has greatly influenced all other philosophies in their Japanese interpretations.', u'Confucianism entered Japan from China around the 5th century A.D., as did Buddhism.', u'Confucian ideals are still evident today in the Japanese concept of society and the self, and in the organization of the government and the structure of society.', u'Buddhism has profoundly impacted Japanese psychology, metaphysics, and aesthetics.', u'Neo-Confucianism, which became prominent in the sixteenth century during the Tokugawa era, shaped Japanese ideas of virtue and social responsibility, and, through its emphasis on investigating the principle or configuration of things, stimulated the Japanese study of the natural world.', u'Also since the 16th century, certain indigenous ideas of loyalty and honour have been held.', u'Western philosophy has had its major impact in Japan only since the middle of the 19th century.', u'=== Cuisine ===\n\nJapanese cuisine is based on combining staple foods, typically Japanese rice or noodles, with a soup and okazu\u2014dishes made from fish, vegetable, tofu and the like\u2014to add flavor to the staple food.', u'In the early modern era ingredients such as red meats that had previously not been widely used in Japan were introduced.', u'Japanese cuisine is known for its emphasis on seasonality of food, quality of ingredients and presentation.', u'Japanese cuisine offers a vast array of regional specialties that use traditional recipes and local ingredients.', u'The phrase ichij\u016b-sansai (\u4e00\u6c41\u4e09\u83dc, "one soup, three sides") refers to the makeup of a typical meal served, but has roots in classic kaiseki, honzen, and y\u016bsoku cuisine.', u'The term is also used to describe the first course served in standard kaiseki cuisine nowadays.', u'Traditional Japanese sweets are known as wagashi.', u'Ingredients such as red bean paste and mochi are used.', u'More modern-day tastes includes green tea ice cream, a very popular flavor.', u'Almost all manufacturers produce a version of it.', u'Kakigori is a shaved ice dessert flavored with syrup or condensed milk.', u'It is usually sold and eaten at summer festivals.', u'Popular Japanese beverages such as sake, which is a brewed rice beverage that, typically, contains 15%~17% alcohol and is made by multiple fermentation of rice.', u"Other beverage like beer is produced in some region such as Sapporo Brewery, the oldest Japan beer's brand.", u'The Michelin Guide has awarded restaurants in Japan more Michelin stars than the rest of the world combined.', u'=== Holidays ===\n\nOfficially, Japan has 15 national, government-recognized holidays.', u'Public holidays in Japan are regulated under the Public Holiday Law (\u56fd\u6c11\u306e\u795d\u65e5\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u6cd5\u5f8b Kokumin no Shukujitsu ni Kansuru H\u014dritsu) of 1948.', u'Beginning in 2000, Japan implemented the Happy Monday System, which moved a number of national holidays to Monday in order to obtain a long weekend.', u'In 2006, the country decided to add Sh\u014dwa Day, a new national holiday, in place of Greenery Day on April 29, and to move Greenery Day to May 4.', u'These changes took effect in 2007.', u'In 2014, the House of Councillors decided to add Mountain Day (\u5c71\u306e\u65e5, Yama no Hi) to the Japanese calendar on August 11, after lobbying by the Japanese Alpine Club.', u"It is intended to coincide with the Bon Festival vacation time, giving Japanese people an opportunity to appreciate Japan's mountains.", u"The national holidays in Japan are New Year's Day on January 1, Coming of Age Day on Second Monday of January, National Foundation Day on February 11, Vernal Equinox Day on March 20 or 21, Sh\u014dwa Day on April 29, Constitution Memorial Day on May 3, Greenery Day on May 4, Children's Day on May 5, Marine Day on Third Monday of July, Mountain Day on August 11, Respect for the Aged Day on Third Monday of September, Autumnal Equinox on September 23 or 24, Health and Sports Day on Second Monday of October, Culture Day on November 3, Labour Thanksgiving Day on November 23, and The Emperor's Birthday on December 23.", u'=== Festivals ===\n\nThere are many festivals in Japan, which are called in Japanese as matsuri (\u796d) which celebrate annually.', u'There are no specific festival days for all of Japan; dates vary from area to area, and even within a specific area, but festival days do tend to cluster around traditional holidays such as Setsubun or Obon.', u'Festivals are often based around one event, with food stalls, entertainment, and carnival games to keep people entertained.', u'Its usually sponsored by a local shrine or temple, though they can be secular.', u'Notable festival often feature processions which may include elaborate floats.', u'Preparation for these processions is usually organised at the level of neighborhoods, or machi (\u753a).', u'Prior to these, the local kami may be ritually installed in mikoshi and paraded through the streets, such as Gion in Kyoto, and Hadaka in Okayama.', u"=== Sports ===\n\nTraditionally, sumo is considered Japan's national sport.", u'Japanese martial arts such as judo, karate and kendo are also widely practiced and enjoyed by spectators in the country.', u'After the Meiji Restoration, many Western sports were introduced in Japan and began to spread through the education system.', u'Japan hosted the Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 1964.', u'Japan has hosted the Winter Olympics twice: Sapporo in 1972 and Nagano in 1998.', u'Tokyo will host the 2020 Summer Olympics, making Tokyo the first Asian city to host the Olympics twice.', u'Japan is the most successful Asian Rugby Union country, winning the Asian Five Nations a record 6 times and winning the newly formed IRB Pacific Nations Cup in 2011.', u'Japan will host the 2019 IRB Rugby World Cup.', u'Baseball is currently the most popular spectator sport in the country.', u"Japan's top professional league, now known as Nippon Professional Baseball, was established in 1936.", u'Since the establishment of the Japan Professional Football League in

one of the most successful football teams in Asia, winning the Asian Cup four times.', u"Also, Japan recently won the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2011.", u'Golf is also popular in Japan, as are forms of auto racing like the Super GT series and Formula Nippon.', u'The country has produced one NBA player, Yuta Tabuse.', u'=== Media ===\n\nTelevision and newspapers take an important role in Japanese mass media, though radio and magazines also take apart.', u'For a long time, newspapers were regarded as the most influential information medium in Japan, although audience attitudes towards television changed with the emergence of commercial news broadcasting in the mid-1980s.', u"Over the last decade, television has clearly come to surpass newspapers as Japan's main information and entertainment medium.", u'There are 6 nationwide television networks, such as NHK, Nippon Television (NTV), Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS), Fuji Network System (FNS), TV Asahi, and TV Tokyo Network (TXN).', u'For the most part, television networks were established based on capital investments by existing radio networks.', u'Variety shows, serial dramas, and news constitute a large percentage of

{'sentences': [u'A full moon is the lunar phase that occurs when the Moon is completely illuminated as seen from Earth.', u'This occurs when Earth is located directly between the Sun and the Moon

by the Sun and appears round (while the far side is almost completely unilluminated).', u"On some occasions at the time of full moon there is also a lunar eclipse so the moon's face appears reddish due to the rayleigh scattering of blue light in Earth's atmosphere.", u"Lunar eclipses can occur only at full moon, where the Moon's orbit allows it to pass through Earth's shadow.", u"Lunar eclipses do not occur every month because the Moon usually passes above or below Earth's shadow (which is mostly restricted to the ecliptic plane).", u'Lunar eclipses can occur only when the full moon occurs near the two nodes of the orbit, either the ascending or descending node.', u'This causes eclipses to only occur about every 6 months, and often 2 weeks before or after a solar eclipse at new moon at the opposite node.', u'The time interval between similar lunar phases\u2014the synodic month\u2014averages about 29.53 days.', u'Therefore, in those lunar calendars in which each month begins on the new moon, the full moon falls on either the 14th or 15th of the lunar month.', u'Because calendar months have a whole number of days, lunar months may be either 29 or 30 days long.', u"== Characteristics ==\nA full moon is often thought of as an event of a full night's duration.", u'This is somewhat misleading because the Moon seen from Earth is continuously becoming larger and/or smaller (though much too slowly to notice with the naked eye).', u'Its absolute maximum size occurs at the moment expansion has stopped.', u'For any given location, about half of these absolute maximum full moons will be potentially visible, as the other half occur during the day, when the full moon is below the horizon.', u'Many almanacs list full moons not just by date, but by their exact time as well, usually in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).', u'Typical monthly calendars that include phases of the Moon may be off by one day if intended for use in a different time zone.', u'Full moons are generally a poor time to conduct astronomical observations, because the bright reflected sunlight from the Moon overwhelms the dimmer light from stars.', u'On 12 December 2008, the full moon occurred closer to the Earth than it had been at any time for the previous 15 years, called a supermoon.', u'On 19 March 2011, another super full moon occurred, closer to the Earth than at any time

of the formula and its parameters.', u'The age and apparent size of the full moon vary in a cycle of just under 14 synodic months, which has been referred to as a full moon cycle.', u'== In folklore and tradition ==\n\nFull moons are traditionally associated with temporal insomnia (inability to sleep), insanity (hence the terms lunacy and lunatic) and various "magical phenomena" such as lycanthropy.', u'Psychologists, however, have found that there is no strong evidence for effects on human behavior around the time of a full moon.', u'They find that studies are generally not consistent, with some showing a positive effect and others showing a negative effect.', u'In one instance, the 23 December 2000 issue of the British Medical Journal published two studies on dog bite admission to hospitals in England and Australia.', u'The study of the Bradford Royal Infirmary found that dog bites were twice as common during a full moon, whereas the study conducted by the public hospitals in Australia found that they were less likely.', u'All this is relevant to canine rather than human behavior.', u'=== Full moon names ===\nHistorically, month names are names of moons (lunations, not necessarily full moons) in lunisolar calendars.', u'Since the introduction of the solar Julian calendar in the Roman Empire, and later the Gregorian calendar worldwide, month names have ceased to be perceived as "moon names".', u'The traditional Old English month names were equated with the names of the Julian calendar from an early time (soon after Christianization, according to the testimony of Bede ca.', u'AD 700).', u'Some full moons have developed new names in modern times, e.g., the blue moon, and the names "harvest moon" and "hunter\'s moon" for the full moons of autumn.', u'==== Harvest and hunter\'s moons ====\n\nThe "harvest moon" and "hunter\'s moon" are traditional terms for the full moons occurring during late summer and in the autumn, in the northern hemisphere usually in August, September and October respectively.', u'The "harvest moon" is the full moon closest to the autumnal equinox (22 or 23 September), and the "hunter\'s moon" is the one following it.', u'The names are recorded from the early 18th century.', u'The Oxford English Dictionary entry for "harvest moon" cites a 1706 reference, and for "hunter\'s moon" a 1710 edition of The British Apollo, where the term is attributed to "the country people" (The Country People call this the Hunters-Moon.)', u'The names became traditional in American folklore, where they are now often popularly attributed to the Native Americans.', u"The Feast of the Hunters' Moon is a yearly festival in West Lafayette, Indiana, held in late September or early October each year since 1968.", u'In 2010, the Harvest moon occurred on the night of equinox itself (some 5\u200a1\u20442 hours after the point of equinox) for the first time since 1991.', u'All full moons rise around the time of sunset.', u'Because the moon moves eastward among the stars faster than the sun its meridian passage is delayed, causing it to rise later each day \u2013 on average by about 50.47 minutes.', u"The harvest moon and hunter's moon are unique because the time difference between moonrises on successive evenings is much shorter than average.", u'The moon rises approximately 30 minutes later from one night to the next, as seen from about 40 degrees N or S latitude.', u'(This is because a full moon in September appears to move not straight east but north-east in the sky.)', u'Thus, there is no long period of darkness between sunset and moonrise for several days following the actual date of the full moon.', u'==== Farmers\' Almanacs ====\nThe Maine Farmers\' Almanac from c. the 1930s began to publish Native American "Indian" full moon names.', u"The Farmers' Almanac (since 1955 published in Maine, but not the same publication as the Maine Farmers' Almanac) continues to do so.", u'An early list of "Indian month names" was published in 1918 by Daniel Carter Beard in his The American Boy\'s Book of Signs, Signals and Symbols for use by the boy scouts.', u'Beard\'s "Indian" month names were:\nJanuary: Difficulty, Black Smoke\nFebruary: Raccoon, Bare Spots on the Ground\nMarch: Wind, Little Grass, Sore-Eye\nApril: Ducks, Goose-Eggs\nMay: Green Grass, Root-Food\nJune: Corn-Planting, Strawberry\nJuly: Buffalo (Bull), Hot Sun\nAugust: Harvest, Cow Buffalo\nSeptember: Wild Rice, Red Plum\nOctober: Leaf-Falling, Nuts\nNovember: Deer-Mating, Fur-Pelts\nDecember: Wolves, Big Moon\nSuch names have gained currency in American folklore.', u'They appear in print more widely outside of the almanac tradition from the 1990s in popular publications about the Moon.', u'Mysteries of the Moon by Patricia Haddock ("Great Mysteries Series", Greenhaven Press, 1992) gave an extensive list of such names along with the individual tribal groups they were supposedly associated with.', u'Haddock supposes that certain "Colonial American" moon names were adopted from Algonquian languages (which were formerly spoken in the territory of New England), while others are based in European tradition (e.g., the Colonial American names for the May moon, "Milk Moon", "Mother\'s Moon", "Hare Moon" have no parallels in the supposed native names, while the name of November, "Beaver Moon" is supposedly based in the Algonquin).', u'The individual names given in Farmers\' Almanac include:\nJanuary: "Wolf Moon" (this is the name of December in Beard 1918) also "Old Moon"\nFebruary: "Snow Moon", also "Hunger Moon"\nMarch: "Worm Moon", "Crow Moon", "Sap Moon", "Lenten Moon"\nApril: "Seed Moon", "Pink Moon", "Sprouting Grass Moon", "Egg Moon" (c.f.', u'"Goose-Egg" in Beard 1918), "Fish Moon"\nMay: "Milk Moon", "Flower Moon", "Corn Planting Moon"\nJune: "Mead Moon", "Strawberry Moon" (c.f.', u'Beard 1918), "Rose Moon", "Thunder Moon"\nJuly: "Hay Moon", "Buck Moon", "Elk Moon", "Thunder Moon"\nAugust: "Corn Moon", "Sturgeon Moon", "Red Moon", "Green Corn Moon", "Grain Moon"\nSeptember: "Harvest Moon", "Full Corn Moon",\nOctober: "Hunter\'s moon", "Blood Moon"/"Sanguine Moon"\nNovember: "Beaver Moon", "Frosty Moon"\nDecember: "Oak Moon", "Cold Moon", "Long Night\'s Moon"\nThe Long Night\'s Moon is the last of the year and the closest to the winter solstice.', u'In June 2016 the so-called "Strawberry Moon" coincided with the Summer solstice for the first time since 1967, and would not return for another 46 years.', u'=== Hindu full moon festivals ===\n\nIn Hinduism, most festivals are celebrated on auspicious days.', u'Many of the Hindu festivals are celebrated on days with a full moon at night.', u'Different parts of India celebrate the same day with different names, as listed below:\nChaitra Purnima - Gudi Padua, Yugadi, Ugadi, Hanuman Jayanti (April 15, 2014)\nVaishakh Purnima - Narasimh Jayanti, Buddha Jayanthi (May 14, 2014)\nJyeshtha Purnima - Vat Savitri Vrat Vat Purnima (June 8, 2014)\nGuru Purnima - the full moon of the Ashadh month\nVyas Purnima - important day for starting education and honoring teachers\nShravan Purnima - good day for starting Upanayan day, Avani Avittam, Raksha Bandhan- conceptually Onam also comes on this day.', u'Bhadrapad Purnima - start of Pitrupaksha, Madhu Purnima\nAshvin Purnima - Sharad Purnima\nKartik Poornima - Thrukkarthika\nMargasirsha Purnima - Thiruvathira, Dathatreya Jayanthi\nPushya Purnima - Thaipusam, Shakambharee Purnima\nMagha Purnima\nPhalguna Purnima - Holi\n\n\n== Lunar and lunisolar calendars ==\n\nMost pre-modern calendars the world over were lunisolar, combining the solar year with the lunation by means of intercalary months.', u'The Julian calendar abandoned this method in favour of a purely solar reckoning while conversely the 7th-century Islamic calendar opted for a purely lunar one.', u'A continuing lunisolar calendar is in the Hebrew calendar.', u'Evidence of this is noted in the dates of Passover and Easter in Judaism and Christianity, respectively.', u'The date of the Jewish Rosh Hashana and Sukkot festivals along with all other Jewish holidays are dependent on the dates of the new moons.', u'=== Intercalary months ===\n\nIn lunisolar calendars, an intercalary month occurs 7 times in the 19 years of the Metonic cycle, or on average every 2.7 years (19/7).', u'In the Hebrew Calendar this is noted with a periodic extra month of Adar in the early spring.', u'==== Blue moon ====\n\nIn the modern system of "traditional" full moon names tied to the solstice and equinox points, a supernumerary full moon in such a period is called a blue moon.', u'The term "blue moon" used in this sense may date to as early as the 16th century, but it became well known in the United States due to the Farmers\' Almanac (published since 1818).', u'According to the Farmers\' Almanac, a "blue moon" is the third full moon in any period between either solstice and equinox, or between equinox and solstice, (calculated using the mean tropical year), which contains four full moons.', u"These seasons are equal in length, unlike the astronomical ones, which vary in length depending on the Earth's speed in its elliptical orbit round the sun.", u'To compare, in 1983 the equal length seasons began at 1.48 AM on 23 March, 9.15 AM on 22 June, 4.42 PM on 21 September and 12.10 AM on 22 December, while the astronomical seasons began at 4.39 AM on 21 March, 11.09 PM on 21 June, 2.42 PM on 23 September and 10.30 AM on 22 December (all times GMT).', u'Due to a misinterpretation of this definition in the March 1946 Sky & Telescope magazine, "blue moon" has also been used in the sense of "the second full moon in any month which contains two full moons (this usage has been noted as "erroneous" by Sky & Telescope in 1999).', u'According to either definition, "blue moons" occur with the average frequency of intercalary months, seven times in 19 years, the Farmers\' Almanac system of "full moon names" effectively defining a lunisolar calendar.', u'== See also ==\n\nLunar eclipse\nLunar phase\nMonth\nNear side of the Moon\nNew moon\nOrbit of the

largest mammal.', u'The largest land mammal is the African bush elephant.', u'The largest known species was for many decades considered to be Paraceratherium orgosensis, a rhinoceros relative thought to have stood up to 5.5 m (18 ft) tall, measured over 9 m (30 ft) long and may have weighed up to 20 tonnes.', u'However, more recent estimates suggest that it was surpassed by the proboscidean Palaeoloxodon namadicus at about 22 tonnes.', u'==== Stem-mammals (Synapsida) ====\n\nThe Permian era Cotylorhynchus, from what is now the southern United States, probably was the largest of all synapsids (most of which became extinct 250 million years ago), at 6 m (20 ft) and 2 tonnes.', u'The largest carnivorous synapsid was Anteosaurus from what is now South Africa during Middle Permian

Reptiles (Reptilia) ====\n\nThe largest living reptile, a representative of the order Crocodilia, is the saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) of Southern Asia and Australia, with adult males being typically 3.9\u20135.5 m (13\u201318 ft) long.', u'The largest confirmed saltwater crocodile on record was 6.32 m (20.7 ft) long, and weighed about 1,360 kg (3,000 lb).', u'Unconfirmed reports of much larger crocodiles exist, but examinations of incomplete remains have never suggested a length greater than 7 m (23 ft).', u'Also, a living specimen estimated at 7 m (23 ft) and 2,000 kg (4,400 lb) has been accepted by the Guinness Book of World Records.', u'However, due to the difficulty of trapping and measuring a very large living crocodile, the accuracy of these dimensions has yet to be verified.', u'A specimen named Lolong caught alive in the Philippines in 2011 (died February 2013) was found to have measured 6.17 m (20.2 ft) in length.', u'The Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis),

only from a few bones.', u'The current record-holders include Argentinosaurus, which may have weighed 73 tonnes; Supersaurus which might have reached 34 m (112 ft) in length and Sauroposeidon which might have been 18 m (59 ft) tall.', u'Two other such sauropods include Bruhathkayosaurus and Amphicoelias fragillimus.', u'Both are known only from fragments.', u'Bruhathkayosaurus might have been between 40\u201344 m (131\u2013144 ft) in length and 175\u2013220 tonnes in weight according to some estimates.', u'A. fragillimus might have been approximately 58 m long and 122.4 metric tons in weight.', u'Theropods (Theropoda)\nThe largest theropod known from a nearly complete skeleton is the biggest and most complete Tyrannosaurus rex specimen, nicknamed "Sue", which was discovered in South Dakota in 1990 and now mounted in the Field Museum of Chicago at a total length of 12.3 m (40 ft).', u'Body mass estimates have reached over 9500 kg, though other figures, such as Hartman\u2019s 2013 estimate of 8400 kg, have been lower.', u'Another giant theropod is the semi-aquatic Spinosaurus aegyptiacus from the mid-Cretaceous of North Africa.', u'Size estimates have been fluctuating far more over the years, with length estimates ranging from 12.6 to 18 m and mass estimates from 7 to 20.9 t. Recent findings favour a length exceeding 15 m  and a body mass of 7.5 tons.', u'Other contenders known from partial skeletons include Giganotosaurus carolinii (est.', u'12.2\u201313.2 m and 6-13.8 tonnes) and Carcharodontosaurus saharicus (est.', u'12-13.3 m and 6.2-15.1 tonnes).', u'Armored dinosaurs (Thyreophora)\nThe largest thyreophorans were Ankylosaurus and Stegosaurus, from the Late Cretaceous and Late Jurassic periods (respectively) of what is now North America, both measuring up to 9 m (30 ft) in length and estimated to weigh up to 6 tonnes.', u'Ornithopods (Ornithopoda)\nThe largest ornithopods, were the hadrosaurids Shantungosaurus, a late Cretaceous dinosaur found in the Shandong Peninsula of China, and Magnapaulia from the late Cretaceous of North America.', u'Both species are known from fragmentary remains but are estimated to have reached over 15 m (49 ft) in length and were likely the heaviest non-sauropod dinosaurs, estimated at over 23 tonnes.', u'Ceratopsians (Ceratopsia)\nThe largest ceratopsians were Triceratops and its ancestor Eotriceratops from the late Cretaceous of North America.', u'Both estimated to have reached about 9 m (30 ft) in length and weighed 12 tonnes.', u'==== Birds (Aves) ====\n\nThe largest living bird, a member of the Struthioniformes, is the common ostrich (Struthio camelus), from the plains of Africa and Arabia.', u'A large male ostrich can reach a height of 2.8 m (9.2 ft) and weigh over 156 kg (344 lb).', u'A mass of 200 kg (440 lb) has been cited for the common ostrich but no wild ostriches of this massive weight have been verified.', u'Eggs laid by the ostrich can weigh 1.4 kg (3.1 lb) and are the largest eggs in the world today.', u'The largest bird in the fossil record may be the extinct elephant birds (Aepyornis) of Madagascar, which were related to the ostrich.', u'They exceeded 3 m (9.8 ft) in height and 500 kg (1,100 lb).', u'The last of the elephant birds became extinct about 300 years ago.', u'Of almost exactly the same upper proportions as the largest elephant birds was Dromornis stirtoni of Australia, part of a 26,000-year-old group called mihirungs of the family Dromornithidae.', u'The largest carnivorous bird was Brontornis, an extinct flightless bird from South America which reached a weight of 350 to 400 kg (770 to 880 lb) and a height of about 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in).', u'The tallest carnivorous bird was Kelenken, which could reach 3 to 3.2 meters in height and 220 to 250 kilograms.', u'The tallest bird ever was the giant moa (Dinornis maximus), part of the moa family of New Zealand that went extinct around 1500 AD.', u'This particular species of moa stood up to 3.7 m (12 ft) tall, but weighed about half as much as a large elephant bird or mihirung due to its comparatively slender frame.', u'The largest bird ever capable of flight was Argentavis magnificens, the largest member of the now extinct family Teratornithidae, found in Miocene-aged fossil beds of Argentina, with a wingspan up to 8.3 m (27 ft), a length of up to 3.5 m (11 ft), a height on the ground of up to 2 m (6.6 ft) and a body weight of at least 80 kg (180 lb).', u'Pelagornis sandersi is thought to have had a wingspan of comparable size.', u'Table of heaviest living birds\nThe following is a list of the heaviest living bird species ranked by average weight.', u'These species are almost all flightless, which allows for these particular birds to have denser bones and heavier bodies.', u'Flightless birds comprise less than 2% of all living bird species.', u'==== Amphibians (Amphibia) ====\n\nThe largest living amphibian is the Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus).', u'The maximum size of this nearly human-sized river-dweller is 64 kg (141 lb) and almost 1.83 m (6.0 ft).', u'Before amniotes became the dominant tetrapods, several giant amphibian proto-tetrapods existed and were certainly the dominant animals in their ecosystems.', u'The largest known was the crocodile-like Prionosuchus, which reached a length of 9 m (30 ft).', u'Frogs (Anura)\nThe largest member of the largest order of amphibians is the African Goliath frog (Conraua goliath).', u'The maximum size this species is verified to attain is a weight of 3.8 kg (8.4 lb) and a snout-to-vent length of 39 cm (15 in).', u'The largest of the toads, the cane toad (Rhinella marina), is also the second largest member of the frog order.', u'This infamous, often invasive species can grow to maximum mass of 2.65 kg (5.8 lb) and measure a maximum of 33 cm (13 in) from snout-to-vent.', u'Rivaling the previous two species, the African bullfrog (Pyxicephalus adspersus) can range up to a weight of 2 kg (4.4 lb) and 25.5 cm (10.0 in) from snout to vent.', u'Another large frog is the largest frog in North America, the American bullfrog, which can reach weights of up to 0.8 kg (1.8 lb) and snout-to-vent-length (SVL) of 20 cm (7.9 in).', u'However, the toad Beelzebufo ampinga, found in fossil from the Cretaceous era in what is now Madagascar, could grow to be 41 cm (16 in) long and weigh up to 4.5 kg (9.9 lb), making it the largest frog ever known.', u'The largest tree frog is the Australasian white-lipped tree frog (Litoria infrafrenata), the females of which can reach a length of 14 cm (5.5 in) from snout to vent and can weigh up to 115 g (4.1 oz).', u'The family Leptodactylidae, one of the most diverse anuran families, also has some very large members.', u'The largest is the Surinam horned frog (Ceratophrys cornuta), which can reach 20 cm (7.9 in) in length from snout to vent and weigh up to 0.48 kg (1.1 lb).', u'While not quite as large as Ceratophrys cornuta, Leptodactylus pentadactylus is often heavier; it can reach 18.5 cm (7.3 in) long and weigh 0.60 kilograms (1.3 pounds).', u'The largest dendrobatid is the Colombian golden poison frog (Phyllobates terribilis), which can attain a length of 6 cm (2.4 in) and nearly 28.3 g (1.00 oz).', u'Most frogs are classified under the suborder Neobatrachia, although nearly 200 species are part of the Mesobatrachia suborder, or ancient frogs.', u'The largest of these are the little-known Brachytarsophrys or Karin Hills frogs, of South Asia, which can grow to a maximum snout-to-vent length of 17 cm (6.7 in) and a maximum weight of 0.54 kg (1.2 lb).', u"Caecilians (Gymnophiona)\nThe largest of the worm-like caecilians is the Colombian Thompson's caecilian (Caecilia thompsoni), which reaches a length of 1.5 m (4.9 ft), a width of about 4.6 cm (1.8 in) and can weigh up to about 1 kg (2.2 lb).", u'Salamanders (Urodela)\nBesides the previously mentioned Chinese giant salamander, the closely related Japanese giant salamander (Andrias japonicus) is also sometimes cited as the largest living amphibian, but salamanders of a greater size than 1.53 m (5.0 ft) and 36 kg (79 lb) have never been verified for this species.', u'Another giant of the amphibian world is the North American Hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis), which can measure up to 0.76 m (2.5 ft).', u'The largest of the newts is the Iberian ribbed newt (Pleurodeles waltl), which can grow up to 30 cm (12 in) in length.', u'==== Fish ====\n\n\n=== Invertebrates ===\n\n\n==== Sponges (Porifera) ====\n\nThe largest known species of sea sponge is the giant barrel sponge, Xestospongia muta.', u'These massively built sponges can reach 2.4 m (8 ft) in height and can be of about the same number of feet across at the thickest part of the "body".', u'Some of these creatures have been estimated to be over 2,400 years of age.', u'Calcareous sponges (Calcarea)\nThe largest known of these small, inconspicuous sponges is probably the species Pericharax heteroraphis, attaining a height of 30 cm (0.98 ft).', u'Most calcareous sponges do not exceed 10 cm (3.9 in) tall.', u'Hexactinellid sponges (Hexactinellida)\nA relatively common species, Rhabdocalyptus dawsoni, can reach a height of 1 m (3.3 ft) once they are of a very old age.', u'This is the maximum size recorded for a hexactinellid sponge.', u"==== Cnidarians (Cnidaria) ====\n\nThe lion's mane jellyfish (Cyanea capillata) is the largest cnidaria species, of the class Scyphozoa.", u'The largest known specimen of this giant, found washed up on the shore of Massachusetts Bay in 1870, had a bell diameter of 2.5 m (8.2 ft), a weight of 150 kg (330 lb).', u'The tentacles of this specimens were as long as 37 m (121 ft) and were projected to have a tentacular spread of about 75 m (246 ft) making it one of the longest extant animals.',

massive overall, are the anemones of the genus Ceriantharia, at up to 2 m (6.6 ft) tall.', u'Communities of coral can be truly massive, a single colony of the Porites genus can be over 10 m (33 ft), but the actual individual organisms are quite small.', u'Lion\'s mane jellyfish\nThe largest known species of jellyfish is the "lion\'s mane jellyfish".', u'The largest of its kind was found in 1870 in Massachusetts Bay with a recorded bell size of 2.3 metres (7 feet 7 inches) and a tentacle length of 37 metres (121 feet).', u'Hydrozoans (Hydrozoa)\nThe colonial siphonophore Praya dubia can

Segmented worms (Annelida) ====\nThe largest of the segmented worms (commonly called earthworms) is the African giant earthworm (Microchaetus rappi).', u'Although it averages about 1.36 m (4.5 ft) in length, this huge worm can reach a length of as much as 6.7 m (22 ft) and can weigh over 1.5 kg (3.3 lb).', u'Only the giant Gippsland earthworm, Megascolides australis, and a few giant polychaetes reach nearly comparable sizes, reaching 4 and 3.6 m (13 and 12 ft), respectively.', u'==== Echinoderms (Echinodermata) ====\n\nThe largest species of echinoderm in terms of bulk is probably the starfish species Thromidia gigas, of the class Asteroidea, which reaches a weight of over 6 kg (13 lb), but it might be beaten by some giant sea cucumbers such as Thelenota anax.', u'However, at a maximum span of 63 cm (25 in), Thromidia gigas is quite a bit shorter than some other echinoderms.', u'The longest echinoderm known is the conspicuous sea cucumber Synapta maculata, with a slender body that can extend up to 3 m (9.8 ft).', u'In comparison, the biggest sea star is the brisingid sea star Midgardia xandaros, reaching a span of 1.4 m (4.6 ft), despite being quite slender.',

but is not confirmed.', u'The genus Metacrinus has a stalk span of 61 cm (24 in) but, due to its bulk and multiple arms, it is heavier than Heliometra.', u'In the past, crinoids grew much larger, and stalk lengths up to 40 m (130 ft) have been found in the fossil record.', u'Sea urchins and allies (Echinoidea)\nThe largest sea urchin is the species Sperosoma giganteum from the deep northwest Pacific Ocean, which can reach a shell width of about 30 cm (12 in).', u'Another deep sea species Hygrosoma hoplacantha is only slightly smaller.', u'The largest species found along the North America coast is the Pacific red sea urchin (Mesocentrotus franciscanus) where the shell can reach 19 cm (7.5 in).', u'If the spines enter into count, the biggest species may be a Diadematidae like Diadema

u'This species can grow to have a span of 1 m (3.3 ft).', u'Sometimes, Gorgonocephalus stimpsoni is considered the largest but the maximum this species is can measure 70 cm (28 in) and a disk diameter of about 14.3 cm (5.6 in).', u'Outside from euryalids, the biggest ophiurid brittle star may be Ophiopsammus maculata (6-7 inches).', u'Sea stars (Asteroidea)\nThe heaviest sea star is Thromidia gigas from the Indo-Pacific, which can surpass 6 kg (13 lb) in weight, but only has a diameter of about 65 cm (2.13 ft).', u'Despite its relatively small disk and weigth, the long slender arms of Midgardia xandaros from the Gulf of California makes it the sea star with the largest diameter at about 1.4 m (4.5 ft).', u'Mithrodia clavigera may also become wider than 1 m (39 in) in some cases, with stout arms.', u'==== Ribbon worms (Nemertea) ====\nThe largest nemertean is the bootlace worm, Lineus longissimus.', u'A specimen found washed ashore on a beach in St. Andrews, Scotland in 1864 was recorded at a length of 55 m (180 ft).', u'==== Mollusks (Mollusca) ====\n\nBoth the largest mollusks and the largest of all invertebrates (in terms of mass) are the largest squids.', u'The colossal squid (Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni) is projected to be the largest invertebrate.', u'Current estimates put its maximum size at 12 to 14 m (39 to 46 ft) long and 750 kg (1,650 lb), based on analysis of smaller specimens.', u'In 2007, authorities in New Zealand announced the capture of the largest known colossal squid specimen.', u'It was initially thought to be 10 m (33 ft) and 450 kg (990 lb).', u'It was later measured at 4.2 m (14 ft) long and 495 kg (1,091 lb) in weight.', u'The mantle was 2.5 m (8.2 ft) long when measured.', u'The giant squid (Architeuthis dux) was previously thought to be the largest squid, and while it is less massive and has a smaller mantle than the colossal squid, it may exceed the colossal squid in overall length including tentacles.', u'One giant squid specimen that washed ashore in 1878 in Newfoundland reportedly measured 18 m (59 ft) in total length (from the tip of the mantle to the end of the long tentacles), head and body length 6.1 m (20 ft), 4.6 m (15 ft) in diameter at the thickest part of mantle, and weighed about 900 kg (2,000 lb).', u'This specimen is still often cited as the largest invertebrate that has ever been examined.', u"However, no animals approaching this size have been scientifically documented and, according to giant squid expert Steve O'Shea, such lengths were likely achieved by greatly stretching the two tentacles like elastic bands.", u'Aplacophorans (Aplacophora)\nThe largest known of these worm-like, shell-less mollusks are represented in the genus Epimenia, which can reach 30 cm (12 in) long.', u'Most

ft), a weight of 18 kg (40 lb) and a width of 96 cm (38 in).', u'Another giant species is Melo amphora, which in a 1974 specimen from West Australia, measured 0.71 m (2.3 ft) long, had a maximum girth of 0.97 m (3.2 ft) and weighed 16 kg (35 lb).', u'The largest shell-less gastropod is the giant black sea hare (Aplysia vaccaria) at 0.99 m (3.2 ft) in length and almost 14 kg (31 lb) in weight.', u'The largest of the land snails is the giant African snail (Achatina achatina) at up to 1 kg (2.2 lb) and 35 cm (14 in) long.', u'Cephalopods (Cephalopoda)\n(See Cephalopod size.)', u'While generally much smaller than the giant Architeuthis and Mesonychoteuthis, the largest of the octopuses, the giant Pacific octopus (Enteroctopus dofleini), can grow to be very large.', u'The largest confirmed weight of a giant octopus is 74 kg (163 lb), with a 7 m (23 ft) arm span (with the tentacles fully extended) and a head-to-tentacle-tip length of 3.9 m (13 ft).', u'Specimens have been reported up to 125 kg (276 lb) but are unverified.', u'==== Arthropods (Arthropoda) ====\n\nThe largest arthropod known to have existed is the eurypterid (sea scorpion) Jaekelopterus, reaching up to 2.5 m (8.2 ft)

probably the giant huntsman spider (Heteropoda maxima) of Laos, which in 2008 replaced the Goliath birdeater (Theraphosa blondi) of northern South America as the largest known spider by leg-span.', u'However the most massive arachnids, of comparable dimensions and possibly even greater mass, are the Chaco golden knee, Grammostola pulchripes, and the Brazilian salmon pink, Lasiodora parahybana.', u'The huntsman spider may span up to 29 cm (11 in) across the legs, while in the New World "tarantulas" like Theraphosa can range up to 26 cm (10 in).', u'In Grammostola, Theraphosa and Lasiodora, the

oz) but is not known to exceed a length of 23 cm (9.1 in).', u'However, they were dwarfed by Pulmonoscorpius kirktonensis, a giant extinct species of scorpion from Scotland, at an estimated length of 0.7 m (2.3 ft) and weight of 15 kg (33 lb), and the aquatic Brontoscorpio, at up to 1 m (3.3 ft) and a similar weight.', u'Branchiopods (Branchiopoda)\nThe largest of these primarily freshwater

shells change colour when they are producing eggs.", u'Lysiosquillina maculataAt a length of up to 40 cm, L. maculata is the largest mantis shrimp in the world.', u'L. maculata may be distinguished from its congener L. sulcata by the greater number of teeth on the last segment of its raptorial claw, and by the colouration of the uropodal endopod, the distal half of which is dark in L. maculata but not in L. sulcata.', u'There is a small artisanal fishery for this species.', u'are largest shrimps Tasmanian giant freshwater crayfish (Astacopsis gouldi) 5 kilograms (11 lb) in weight and over 80 centimetres (31 in) long have been known in the past, but now, even individuals over 2 kilograms (4.4 lb) are rare.', u'The species is only found in Tasmanian rivers flowing north into the Bass Strait below 400 metres (1,300 ft) above sea level, and is listed as an endangered species on the IUCN Red List.', u'Millipedes (Diplopoda)\nTwo species of millipede both reach a very large size

larger record sizes.', u'An isolated pygidium of Hungioides bohemicus implies that the full animal was 90 cm (35 in) long.', u'===== Insects (Insecta) =====\n\nInsects, a class of Arthropoda, are easily the most numerous class of organisms, with over one million identified species, and probably many undescribed species.', u'The heaviest insect is almost certainly a species of beetle, which incidentally is the most species-rich order of organisms.', u"Although heavyweight giant wetas (Deinacrida heteracantha) are known, the elephant beetles of Central and South America, (Megasoma

reach a higher weight.", u'The most frequently crowned are the Goliath beetles, the top known size of which is at least 100 g (3.5 oz) and 11.5 cm (4.5 in).', u'The elephant beetles and titan beetle can reach greater lengths than the Goliath, at up to 13.1 and 15.2 cm (5.2 and 6.0 in), respectively, but this is in part thanks to their rather large horns.', u"The Goliath beetle's wingspan can range up to 25 cm (9.8 in).", u'Some moths and butterflies have much larger areas than the heaviest beetles, but weigh a fraction as much.', u'The longest insects are the stick insects, see below.', u'Representatives of the extinct dragonfly-like order Protodonata such as the Carboniferous Meganeura monyi of what is now France and the Permian Meganeuropsis permiana of what is now North America

Green holds that the parthenon was the room in which the peplos presented to Athena at the Panathenaic Festival was woven by the arrephoroi, a group of four young girls chosen to serve Athena each year.', u'Christopher Pelling asserts that Athena Parthenos may have constituted a discrete cult of Athena, intimately connected with, but not identical to, that of Athena Polias.', u'According to this theory, the name of the Parthenon means the "temple of the virgin goddess" and refers to the cult of Athena Parthenos that was associated with the temple.', u'The epithet parth\xe9nos (\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2), whose origin is also unclear, meant "maiden, girl", but also "virgin, unmarried woman" and was especially used for Artemis, the goddess of wild animals, the hunt, and vegetation, and for Athena, the goddess of strategy and tactics, handicraft, and practical reason.', u'It has also been suggested that the name of the temple alludes to the maidens (parthenoi), whose supreme sacrifice guaranteed the safety of the city.', u'The first instance in which Parthenon definitely refers to the entire building is found in the writings of the 4th century BC orator Demosthenes.', u'In 5th-century building accounts, the structure is simply called ho naos ("the temple").', u'The architects Iktinos and Callicrates are said to have called the building Hekatompedos ("the hundred footer") in their lost treatise on Athenian architecture, and, in the 4th century and later, the building was referred to as the Hekatompedos or the Hekatompedon as well as the Parthenon; the 1st-century-AD writer Plutarch referred to the building as the Hekatompedon Parthenon.', u'Because the Parthenon was dedicated to the Greek goddess Athena, it has sometimes been referred to as the Temple of Minerva, the Roman name for Athena, particularly during the 19th century.', u'== Function ==\n\nAlthough the Parthenon is architecturally a temple and is usually called so, it is not really one in the conventional sense of the word.', u'A small shrine has been excavated within the building, on the site of an older sanctuary probably dedicated to Athena as a way to get closer to the goddess, but the Parthenon never hosted the cult of Athena Polias, patron of Athens: the cult image, which was bathed in the sea and to which was presented the peplos, was an olivewood xoanon, located at an older altar on the northern side of the Acropolis.', u'The colossal statue of Athena by Phidias was not related to any cult and is not known to have inspired any religious fervour.', u'It did not seem to have any priestess, altar or cult name.', u'According to Thucydides, Pericles once referred to the statue as a gold reserve, stressing that it "contained forty talents of pure gold and it was all removable".', u'The Athenian statesman thus implies that the metal, obtained from contemporary coinage, could be used again without any impiety.', u"The Parthenon should then be viewed as a grand setting for Phidias' votive statue rather than a cult site.", u'It is said in many writings of the Greeks that there were many treasures stored inside the temple, such as Persian swords and small statue figures made of precious metals.', u'Archaeologist Joan Breton Connelly has recently argued for the coherency of the Parthenon\u2019s sculptural programme in presenting a succession of genealogical narratives that track Athenian identity back through the ages: from the birth of Athena, through cosmic and epic battles, to the final great event of the Athenian Bronze Age, the war of Erechtheus and Eumolpos.', u'She argues a pedagogical function for the Parthenon\u2019s sculptured decoration, one that establishes and perpetuates Athenian foundation myth, memory, values and identity.', u"While some classicists, including Mary Beard, Peter Green, and Garry Wills have doubted or rejected Connelly's thesis, an increasing number of historians, archaeologists, and classical scholars support her work.", u'They include: J.J. Pollitt, Brunilde Ridgway, Nigel Spivey, Caroline Alexander, A.E.', u'Stallings, Rebecca Goldstein, Freeman Dyson, William St Clair, Donald Kagan, Gregory Nagy, and Angelos Chaniotis.', u'== Early history ==\n\n\n=== Older Parthenon ===\n\nThe first endeavour to build a sanctuary for Athena Parthenos on the site of the present Parthenon was begun shortly after the Battle of Marathon (c. 490\u2013488 BC) upon a solid limestone foundation that extended and levelled the southern part of the Acropolis summit.', u'This building replaced a hekatompedon (meaning "hundred-footer") and would have stood beside the archaic temple dedicated to Athena Polias ("of the city").', u'The Older or Pre-Parthenon, as it is frequently referred to, was still under construction when the Persians sacked the city in 480 BC and razed the Acropolis.', u'The existence of both the proto-Parthenon and its destruction were known from Herodotus, and the drums of its columns were plainly visible built into the curtain wall north of the Erechtheon.', u'Further physical evidence of this structure was revealed with the excavations of Panagiotis Kavvadias of 1885\u201390.', u'The findings of this dig allowed Wilhelm D\xf6rpfeld, then director of the German Archaeological Institute, to assert that there existed a distinct substructure to the original Parthenon, called Parthenon I by D\xf6rpfeld, not immediately below the present edifice as had been previously assumed.', u"D\xf6rpfeld's observation was that the three steps of the first Parthenon consisted of two steps of Poros limestone, the same as the foundations, and a top step of Karrha limestone that was covered by the lowest step of the Periclean Parthenon.", u'This platform was smaller and slightly to the north of the final Parthenon, indicating that it was built for a wholly different building, now completely covered over.', u'This picture was somewhat complicated by the publication of the final report on the 1885\u201390 excavations, indicating that the substructure was contemporary with the Kimonian walls, and implying a later date for the first temple.', u'If the original Parthenon was indeed destroyed in 480, it invites the question of why the site was left a ruin for thirty-three years.', u'One argument involves the oath sworn by the Greek allies before the Battle of Plataea in 479 BC declaring that the sanctuaries destroyed by the Persians would not be rebuilt, an oath from which the Athenians were only absolved with the Peace of Callias in 450.', u'The mundane fact of the cost of reconstructing Athens after the Persian sack is at least as likely a cause.', u'However, the excavations of Bert Hodge Hill led him to propose the existence of a second Parthenon, begun in the period of Kimon after 468 BC.', u'Hill claimed that the Karrha limestone step D\xf6rpfeld thought was the highest of Parthenon I was in fact the lowest of the three steps of Parthenon II, whose stylobate dimensions Hill calculated at 23.51 by 66.888 metres (77.13 ft \xd7 219.45 ft).', u'One difficulty in dating the proto-Parthenon is that at the time of the 1885 excavation the archaeological method of seriation was not fully developed; the careless digging and refilling of the site led to a loss of much valuable information.', u'An attempt to discuss and make sense of the potsherds found on the Acropolis came with the two-volume study by Graef and Langlotz published in 1925\u201333.', u'This inspired American archaeologist William Bell Dinsmoor to attempt to supply limiting dates for the temple platform and the five walls hidden under the re-terracing of the Acropolis.', u'Dinsmoor concluded that the latest possible date for Parthenon I was no earlier than 495 BC, contradicting the early date given by D\xf6rpfeld.', u'Further, Dinsmoor denied that there were two proto-Parthenons, and held that the only pre-Periclean temple was what D\xf6rpfeld referred to as Parthenon II.', u'Dinsmoor and D\xf6rpfeld exchanged views in the American Journal of Archaeology in 1935.', u'=== Present building ===\n\nIn the mid-5th century BC, when the Athenian Acropolis became the seat of the Delian League and Athens was the greatest cultural centre of its time, Pericles initiated an ambitious building project that lasted the entire second half of the century.', u'The most important buildings visible on the Acropolis today \u2014 the Parthenon, the Propylaia, the Erechtheion and the temple of Athena Nike \u2014 were erected during this period.', u'The Parthenon was built under the general supervision of the artist Phidias, who also had charge of the sculptural decoration.', u'The architects Ictinos and Callicrates began their work in 447 BC, and the building was substantially completed by 432, but work on the decorations continued until at least 431.', u'Some of the financial accounts for the Parthenon survive and show that the largest single expense was transporting the stone from Mount Pentelicus, about 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) from Athens, to the Acropolis.', u'The funds were in part stolen by Pericles from the treasury of the Delian League, which was moved from the Panhellenic sanctuary at Delos to the Acropolis in 454 BC.', u'== Architecture ==\n\nThe Parthenon is a peripteral octastyle Doric temple with Ionic architectural features.', u'It stands on a platform or stylobate of three steps.', u'In common with other Greek temples, it is of post and lintel construction and is surrounded by columns ("peripteral") carrying an entablature.', u'There are eight columns at either end ("octastyle") and seventeen on the sides.', u'There is a double row of columns at either end.', u'The colonnade surrounds an inner masonry structure, the cella, which is divided into two compartments.', u'At either end of the building the gable is finished with a triangular pediment originally filled with sculpture.', u'The columns are of the Doric order, with simple capitals, fluted shafts and no bases.', u'Above the architrave of the entablature is a frieze of carved pictorial panels (metopes), separated by formal architectural triglyphs, typical of the Doric order.', u'Around the cella and across the lintels of the inner columns runs a continuous sculptured frieze in low relief.', u'This element of the architecture is Ionic in style rather than Doric.', u'Measured at the stylobate, the dimensions of the base of the Parthenon are 69.5 by 30.9 metres (228 by 101 ft).', u'The cella was 29.8 metres long by 19.2 metres wide (97.8 \xd7 63.0 ft), with internal colonnades in two tiers, structurally necessary to support the roof.', u'On the exterior, the Doric columns measure 1.9 metres (6.2 ft) in diameter and are 10.4 metres (34 ft) high.', u'The corner columns are slightly larger in diameter.', u'The Parthenon had 46 outer columns and 23 inner columns in total, each column containing 20 flutes.', u'(A flute is the concave shaft carved into the column form.)', u'The stylobate has an upward curvature towards its centre of 60 millimetres (2.4 in) on the east and west ends, and of 110 millimetres (4.3 in) on the sides.', u'The roof was covered with large overlapping marble tiles known as imbrices and tegulae.', u'The Parthenon is regarded as the finest example of Greek architecture.', u'The temple, wrote John Julius Cooper, "enjoys the reputation of being the most perfect Doric temple ever built.', u'Even in antiquity, its architectural refinements were legendary, especially the subtle correspondence between the curvature of the stylobate, the taper of the naos walls and the entasis of the columns."', u'Entasis refers to the slight swelling, of 1/8 inch, in the centre of the columns to counteract the appearance of columns having a waist, as the swelling makes them look straight from a distance.', u'The stylobate is the platform on which the columns stand.', u'As in many other classical Greek temples, it has a slight parabolic upward curvature intended to shed rainwater and reinforce the building against earthquakes.', u'The columns might therefore be supposed to lean outwards, but they actually lean slightly inwards so that if they carried on, they would meet almost exactly a mile above the centre of the Parthenon; since they are all the same height, the curvature of the outer stylobate edge is transmitted to the architrave and roof above: "All follow the rule of being built to delicate curves", Gorham Stevens observed when pointing out that, in addition, the west front was built at a slightly higher level than that of the east front.', u'It is not universally agreed what the intended effect of these "optical refinements" was; they may serve as a sort of "reverse optical illusion".', u'As the Greeks may have been aware, two parallel lines appear to bow, or curve outward, when intersected by converging lines.', u'In this case, the ceiling and floor of the temple may seem to bow in the presence of the surrounding angles of the building.', u'Striving for perfection, the designers may have added these curves, compensating for the illusion by creating their own curves, thus negating this effect and allowing the temple to be seen as they intended.', u"It is also suggested that it was to enliven what might have appeared an inert mass in the case of a building without curves, but the comparison ought to be according to Smithsonian historian Evan Hadingham with the Parthenon's more obviously curved predecessors than with a notional rectilinear temple.", u'Some studies of the Acropolis, including the Parthenon, conclude that many of its proportions approximate the golden ratio.', u"The Parthenon's fa\xe7ade as well as elements of its fa\xe7ade and elsewhere can be circumscribed by golden rectangles.", u'This view that the golden ratio was employed in the design has been disputed in more recent studies.', u'== Sculpture ==\n\nThe cella of the Parthenon housed the chryselephantine statue of Athena Parthenos sculpted by Phidias and dedicated in 439 or 438 BC.', u'The appearance of this is known from other images.', u'The decorative stonework was originally highly coloured.', u'The temple was dedicated to Athena at that time, though construction continued until almost the beginning of the Peloponnesian War in 432.', u'By the year 438, the sculptural decoration of the Doric metopes on the frieze above the exterior colonnade, and of the Ionic frieze around the upper portion of the walls of the cella, had been completed.', u"The richness of the Parthenon's frieze and metope decoration is in agreement with the function of the temple as a treasury.", u'In the opisthodomus (the back room of the cella) were stored the monetary contributions of the Delian League, of which Athens was the leading member.', u'Only a few of the sculptures remain in situ; most of the surviving sculptures are today (controversially) in the British Museum in London as the Elgin Marbles, and the Athens Acropolis Museum, but a few pieces are also in the Louvre, and museums in Rome, Vienna and Palermo.', u"=== Metopes ===\n\nThe frieze of the Parthenon's entablature contained ninety-two metopes, fourteen each on the east and west sides, thirty-two each on the north and south sides.", u'They were carved in high relief, a practice employed until then only in treasuries (buildings used to keep votive gifts to the gods).', u'According to the building records, the metope sculptures date to the years 446\u2013440 BC.', u'The metopes of the east side of the Parthenon, above the main entrance, depict the Gigantomachy (mythical battles between the Olympian gods and the Giants).', u'The metopes of the west end show Amazonomachy (mythical battle of the Athenians against the Amazons).', u'The metopes of the south side show the Thessalian Centauromachy (battle of the Lapiths aided by Theseus against the half-man, half-horse Centaurs).', u'Metopes 13\u201321 are missing, but drawings from 1674 attributed to Jaques Carrey indicate a series of humans; these have been variously interpreted as scenes from the Lapith wedding, scenes from the early history of Athens and various myths.', u'On the north side of the Parthenon, the metopes are poorly preserved, but the subject seems to be the sack of Troy.', u"The metopes present examples of the Severe Style in the anatomy of the figures' heads, in the limitation of the corporal movements to the contours and not to the muscles, and in the presence of pronounced veins in the figures of the Centauromachy.", u'Several of the metopes still remain on the building, but, with the exception of those on the northern side, they are severely damaged.', u'Some of them are located at the Acropolis Museum, others are in the British Museum, and one is at the Louvre museum.', u'In March 2011, archaeologists announced that they had discovered five metopes of the Parthenon in the south wall of the Acropolis, which had been extended when the Acropolis was used as a fortress.', u'According to Eleftherotypia daily, the archaeologists claimed the metopes had been placed there in the 18th century when the Acropolis wall was being repaired.', u'The experts discovered the metopes while processing 2,250 photos with modern photographic methods, as the white Pentelic marble they are made of differed from the other stone of the wall.', u'It was previously presumed that the missing metopes were destroyed during the Morosini explosion of the Parthenon in 1687.', u'=== Frieze ===\n\nThe most characteristic feature in the architecture and decoration of the temple is the Ionic frieze running around the exterior walls of the cella, which is the inside structure of the Parthenon.', u'The bas-relief frieze was carved in situ; it is dated to 442 BC-438 BC.', u'One interpretation is that it depicts an idealized version of the Panathenaic procession from the Dipylon Gate in the Kerameikos to the Acropolis.', u'In this procession held every year, with a special procession taking place every four years, Athenians and foreigners were participating to honour the goddess Athena, offering sacrifices and a new peplos (dress woven by selected noble Athenian girls called ergastines).', u'Joan Breton Connelly offers a mythological interpretation for the frieze, one that is in harmony with the rest of the temple\u2019s sculptural programme which shows Athenian genealogy through a series of succession myths set in the remote past.', u'She identifies the central panel above the door of the Parthenon as the pre-battle sacrifice of the daughter of King Erechtheus, a sacrifice that ensured Athenian victory over Eumolpos and his Thracian army.', u'The great procession marching toward the east end of the Parthenon shows the post-battle thanksgiving sacrifice of cattle and sheep, honey and water, followed by the triumphant army of Erechtheus returning from their victory.', u'This represents the very first Panathenaia set in mythical times, the model on which historic Panathenaic processions was based.', u'=== Pediments ===\nThe traveller Pausanias, when he visited the Acropolis at the end of the 2nd century AD, only mentioned briefly the sculptures of the pediments (gable ends) of the temple, reserving the majority of his description for the gold and ivory statue of the goddess inside.', u'==== East pediment ====\n\nThe east pediment narrates the birth of Athena from the head of her father, Zeus.', u'According to Greek mythology, Zeus gave birth to Athena after a terrible headache prompted him to summon Hephaestus (the god of fire and the forge) for assistance.', u"To alleviate the pain, he ordered Hephaestus to strike him with his forging hammer, and when he did, Zeus's head split open and out popped the goddess Athena in full armour.", u"The sculptural arrangement depicts the moment of Athena's birth.", u'Unfortunately, the centrepieces of the pediment were destroyed even before Jacques Carrey created otherwise useful documentary drawings in 1674, so all reconstructions are subject to conjecture and speculation.', u'The main Olympian gods must have stood around Zeus and Athena watching the wondrous event, with Hephaestus and Hera probably near them.', u'The Carrey drawings are instrumental in reconstructing the sculptural arrangement beyond the centre figures to the north and south.', u"==== West pediment ====\nThe west pediment faced the Propylaia and depicted the contest between Athena and Poseidon during their competition for the honour of becoming the city's patron.", u'Athena and Poseidon appear at the centre of the composition, diverging from one another in strong diagonal forms, with the goddess holding the olive tree and the god of the sea raising his trident to strike the earth.', u'At their flanks, they are framed by two active groups of horses pulling chariots, while a crowd of legendary personalities from Athenian mythology fills the space out to the acute corners of the pediment.', u'The work on the pediments lasted from 438 to 432 BC, and the sculptures of the Parthenon pediments are some of the finest examples of classical Greek art.', u'The figures are sculpted in natural movement with bodies full of vital energy that bursts through their flesh, as the flesh in turn bursts through their thin clothing.', u'The thin chitons reveal the body underneath as the focus of the composition.', u'The distinction between gods and humans is blurred in the conceptual interplay between the idealism and naturalism bestowed on the stone by the sculptors.', u'The pediments no longer exist.', u'=== Athena Parthenos ===\n\nThe only piece of sculpture from the Parthenon known to be from the hand of Phidias was the statue of Athena housed in the naos.', u'This massive chryselephantine sculpture is now lost and known only from copies, vase painting, gems, literary descriptions and coins.', u"== Later history ==\n\n\n=== Late antiquity ===\n\nA major fire broke out in the Parthenon shortly after the middle of the third century AD which destroyed the Parthenon's roof and much of the sanctuary's interior.", u'Heruli pirates are also credited with sacking Athens in 276, and destroying most of the public buildings there, including the Parthenon.', u'Repairs were made in the fourth century AD, possibly during the reign of Julian the Apostate.', u'A new wooden roof overlaid with clay tiles was installed to cover the sanctuary.', u"It sloped at a greater incline than the original roof and left the building's wings exposed.", u'The Parthenon survived as a temple dedicated to Athena for nearly one thousand years until Theodosius II decreed in 435 AD that all pagan temples in the Byzantine Empire be closed.', u"At some point in the fifth century, Athena's great cult image was looted by one of the emperors and taken to Constantinople, where it was later destroyed, possibly during the siege of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade in 1204 AD.", u'=== Christian church ===\nThe Parthenon was converted into a Christian church in the final decade of the sixth century AD to become the Church of the Parthenos Maria (Virgin Mary), or the Church of the Theotokos (Mother of God).', u"The orientation of the building was changed to face towards the east; the main entrance was placed at the building's western end, and the Christian altar and iconostasis were situated towards the building's eastern side adjacent to an apse built where the temple's pronaos was formerly located.", u"A large central portal with surrounding side-doors was made in the wall dividing the cella, which became the church's nave, from the rear chamber, the church's narthex.", u'The spaces between the columns of the opisthodomus and the peristyle were walled up, though a number of doorways still permitted access.', u"Icons were painted on the walls and many Christian inscriptions were carved into the Parthenon's columns.", u'These renovations inevitably led to the removal and dispersal of some of the sculptures.', u'Those depicting gods were either possibly re-interpreted according to a Christian theme, or removed and destroyed.', u'The Parthenon became the fourth most important Christian pilgrimage destination in the Eastern Roman Empire after Constantinople, Ephesos, and Thessalonica.', u'In 1018, the emperor Basil II went on a pilgrimage to Athens directly after his final victory over the Bulgarians for the sole purpose of worshipping at the Parthenon.', u'In medieval Greek accounts it is called the Temple of Theotokos Atheniotissa and often indirectly referred to as famous without explaining exactly which temple they were referring to, thus establishing that it was indeed well known.', u'At the time of the Latin occupation, it became for about 250 years a Roman Catholic church of Our Lady.', u"During this period a tower, used either as a watchtower or bell tower and containing a spiral staircase, was constructed at the southwest corner of the cella, and vaulted tombs were built beneath the Parthenon's floor.", u'=== Islamic mosque ===\n\nIn 1456, Ottoman Turkish forces invaded Athens and laid siege to a Florentine army defending the Acropolis until June 1458, when it surrendered to the Turks.', u'The Turks may have briefly restored the Parthenon to the Greek Orthodox Christians for continued use as a church.', u'Some time before the close of the fifteenth century, the Parthenon became a mosque.', u'The precise circumstances under which the Turks appropriated it for use as a mosque are unclear; one account states that Mehmed II ordered its conversion as punishment for an Athenian plot against Ottoman rule.', u'The apse became a mihrab, the tower previously constructed during the Roman Catholic occupation of the Parthenon was extended upwards to become a minaret, a minbar was installed, the Christian altar and iconostasis were removed, and the walls were whitewashed to cover icons of Christian saints and other Christian imagery.', u"Despite the alterations accompanying the Parthenon's conversion into a church and subsequently a mosque, its structure had remained basically intact.", u'In 1667 the Turkish traveller Evliya \xc7elebi expressed marvel at the Parthenon\'s sculptures and figuratively described the building as "like some impregnable fortress not made by human agency".', u'He composed a poetic supplication that it, as "a work less of human hands than of Heaven itself, should remain standing for all time".', u"The French artist Jacques Carrey in 1674 visited the Acropolis and sketched the Parthenon's sculptural decorations.", u'Early in 1687, an engineer named Plantier sketched the Parthenon for the Frenchman Graviers d\u2019Orti\xe8res.', u'These depictions, particularly those made by Carrey, provide important, and sometimes the only, evidence of the condition of the Parthenon and its various sculptures prior to the devastation it suffered in late 1687 and the subsequent looting of its art objects.', u'=== Destruction ===\n\nIn 1687, the Parthenon was extensively damaged in the greatest catastrophe to befall it in its long history.', u'As part of the Great Turkish War (1683-1699), the Venetians sent an expedition led by Francesco Morosini to attack Athens and capture the Acropolis.', u'The Ottoman Turks fortified the Acropolis and used the Parthenon as a gunpowder magazine \u2013 despite having been forewarned of the dangers of this use by the 1656 explosion that severely damaged the Propylaea \u2013 and as a shelter for members of the local Turkish community.', u'On 26 September a Venetian mortar round, fired from the Hill of Philopappus, blew up the magazine, and the building was partly destroyed.', u"The explosion blew out the building's central portion and caused the cella's walls to crumble into rubble.", u'Greek architect and archaeologist Kornilia Chatziaslani writes that "...three of the sanctuary\u2019s four walls nearly collapsed and three-fifths of the sculptures from the frieze fell.', u'Nothing of the roof apparently remained in place.', u'Six columns from the south side fell, eight from the north, as well as whatever remained from eastern porch, except for one column.', u'The columns brought down with them the enormous marble architraves, triglyphs and metopes."', u'About three hundred people were killed in the explosion, which showered marble fragments over nearby Turkish defenders and caused large fires that burned until the following day and consumed many homes.', u'Accounts written at the time conflict over whether this destruction was deliberate or accidental; one such account, written by the German officer Sobievolski, states that a Turkish deserter revealed to Morosini the use to which the Turks had put the Parthenon expecting that the Venetians would not target a building of such historic importance.', u'Morosini was said to have responded by directing his artillery to aim at the Parthenon.', u'Subsequently, Morosini sought to loot sculptures from the ruin and caused further damage in the process.', u"Sculptures of Poseidon and Athena's horses fell to the ground and smashed as his soldiers tried to detach them from the building's west pediment.", u'The following year, the Venetians abandoned Athens to avoid a confrontation with a large force the Turks had assembled at Chalcis; at that time, the Venetians had considered blowing up what remained of the Parthenon along with the rest of the Acropolis to deny its further use as a fortification to the Turks, but that idea was not pursued.', u'After the Turks had recaptured the Acropolis they used some of the rubble produced by this explosion to erect a smaller mosque within the shell of the ruined Parthenon.', u'For the next century and a half, portions of the remaining structure were looted for building material and any remaining objects of value.', u'The 18th century was a period of Ottoman stagnation; as a result, many more Europeans found access to Athens, and the picturesque ruins of the Parthenon were much drawn and painted, spurring a rise in philhellenism and helping to arouse sympathy in Britain and France for Greek independence.', u'Amongst those early travellers and archaeologists were James Stuart and Nicholas Revett, who were commissioned by the Society of Dilettanti to survey the ruins of classical Athens.', u'What they produced was the first measured drawings of the Parthenon published in 1787 in the second volume of Antiquities of Athens Measured and Delineated.', u'In 1801, the British Ambassador at Constantinople, the Earl of Elgin, obtained a questionable firman (edict) from the Sultan, whose existence or legitimacy has not been proved until today, to make casts and drawings of the antiquities on the Acropolis, to demolish recent buildings if this was necessary to view the antiquities, and to remove sculptures from them.', u'=== Independent Greece ===\n\nWhen independent Greece gained control of Athens in 1832, the visible section of the minaret was demolished; only its base and spiral staircase up to the level of the architrave remain intact.', u'Soon all the medieval and Ottoman buildings on the Acropolis were destroyed.', u"However, the image of the small mosque within the Parthenon's cella has been preserved in Joly de Lotbini\xe8re's photograph, published in Lerebours's Excursions Daguerriennes in 1842: the first photograph of the Acropolis.", u'The area became a historical precinct controlled by the Greek government.', u'Today it attracts millions of tourists every year, who travel up the path at the western end of the Acropolis, through the restored Propylaea, and up the Panathenaic Way to the Parthenon, which is surrounded by a low fence to prevent damage.', u'=== Dispute over the marbles ===\n\nThe dispute centres around the Parthenon Marbles removed by Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin, from 1801 to 1803, which are in the British Museum.', u'A few sculptures from the Parthenon are also in the Louvre in Paris, in Copenhagen, and elsewhere, but more than half are in the Acropolis Museum in Athens.', u'A few can still be seen on the building itself.', u'The Greek government has campaigned since 1983 for the British Museum to return the sculptures to Greece.', u'The British Museum has steadfastly refused to return the sculptures, and successive British governments have been unwilling to force the Museum to do so (which would require legislation).', u'Nevertheless, talks between senior representatives from Greek and British cultural ministries and their legal advisors took place in London on 4 May 2007.', u'These were the first serious negotiations for several years, and there were hopes that the two sides may move a step closer to a resolution.', u'== Restoration ==\nIn 1975, the Greek government began a concerted effort to restore the Parthenon and other Acropolis structures.', u'After some delay, a Committee for the Conservation of the Acropolis Monuments was established in 1983.', u'The project later attracted funding and technical assistance from the European Union.', u'An archaeological committee thoroughly documented every artifact remaining on the site, and architects assisted with computer models to determine their original locations.', u'Particularly important and fragile sculptures were transferred to the Acropolis Museum.', u'A crane was installed for moving marble blocks; the crane was designed to fold away beneath the roofline when not in use.', u'In some cases, prior re-construction was found to be incorrect.', u'These were dismantled, and a careful process of restoration began.', u'Originally, various blocks were held together by elongated iron H pins that were completely coated in lead, which protected the iron from corrosion.', u'Stabilizing pins added in the 19th century were not so coated, and corroded.', u'Since the corrosion product (rust) is expansive, the expansion caused further damage by cracking the marble.', u'==

{'sentences': [u'Rome (/\u02c8ro\u028am/ ROHM; Italian: Roma [\u02c8ro\u02d0ma], Latin: R\u014dma) is a city and special comune (named Roma Capitale) in Italy.', u'Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region.', u"With 2.9 million residents in 1,285 km2 (496.1 sq mi), it is also the country's largest and most populated comune and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits.", u'The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents.', u'The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river.', u'The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.', u"Rome's history spans more than two and a half thousand years.", u'While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at only around 753 BC, the site has been inhabited for much longer, making it one of the oldest continuously occupied sites in Europe.', u"The city's early population originated from a mix of Latins, Etruscans and Sabines.", u'Eventually, the city successively became the capital of the Roman Kingdom, the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, and is regarded as one of the birthplaces of Western civilisation and by some as the first ever metropolis.', u'It is referred to as "Roma Aeterna" (The Eternal City) and "Caput Mundi" (Capital of the World), two central notions in ancient Roman culture.', u'After the fall of the Western Empire, which marked the beginning of the Middle Ages, Rome slowly fell under the political control of the Papacy, which had settled in the city since the 1st century AD, until in the 8th century it became the capital of the Papal States, which lasted until 1870.', u"Beginning with the Renaissance, almost all the popes since Nicholas V (1422\u201355) pursued coherently along four hundred years an architectonic and urbanistic programme aimed to make of the city the world's artistic and cultural centre.", u'Due to that, Rome became first one of the major centres of the Italian Renaissance, and then the birthplace of both the Baroque style and Neoclassicism.', u'Famous artists, painters, sculptors and architects made Rome the centre of their activity, creating masterpieces throughout the city.', u'In 1871 Rome became the capital of the Kingdom of Italy, and in 1946 that of the Italian Republic.', u'Rome has the status of a global city.', u'Rome ranked in 2014 as the 14th-most-visited city in the world, 3rd most visited in the European Union, and the most popular tourist attraction in Italy.', u'Its historic centre is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.', u"Monuments and museums such as the Vatican Museums and the Colosseum are among the world's most visited tourist destinations with both locations receiving millions of tourists a year.", u"Rome hosted the 1960 Summer Olympics and is the seat of United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).", u'== Etymology ==\nAccording to the founding myth of the city by the Ancient Romans themselves, the long-held tradition of the origin of the name "Roma" is believed to have come from the city\'s founder and first king, Romulus.', u'However, it is a possibility that the name Romulus was actually derived from Rome itself.', u'As early as the 4th century, there have been alternate theories proposed on the origin of the name Roma.', u'Several hypotheses have been advanced focusing on its uncertain linguistic roots.', u':\nFrom Rumon or Rumen, archaic name of the Tiber, which in turn has the same root as the Greek verb \u1fe5\u03ad\u03c9 (rh\xe8o) and the Latin verb ruo, which both mean "flow";\nFrom the Etruscan word ruma, whose root is *rum- "teat", with possible reference either to the totem wolf that adopted and suckled the cognately named twins Romulus and Remus, or to the shape of the Palatine and Aventine Hills;\nFrom the Greek word \u1fe4\u03ce\u03bc\u03b7 (rh\u014dm\u0113), which means strength.', u'== History ==\n\n\n=== Earliest history ===\n\nThere is archaeological evidence of human occupation of the Rome area from approximately 14,000 years ago, but the dense layer of much younger debris obscures Palaeolithic and Neolithic sites.', u'Evidence of stone tools, pottery and stone weapons attest to about 10,000 years of human presence.', u'Several excavations support the view that Rome grew from pastoral settlements on the Palatine Hill built above the area of the future Roman Forum.', u'Between the end of the bronze age and the beginning of the Iron age, each hill between the sea and the Capitol was topped by a village (on the Capitol Hill, a village is attested since the end of the 14th century BC).', u'However, none of them had yet an urban quality.', u'Nowadays, there is a wide consensus that the city was gradually born through the aggregation ("synoecism") of several villages around the largest one, placed above the Palatine.', u'This aggregation, signalling the passage from a proto-urban to an urban situation, was allowed by the increase of agricultural productivity above the subsistence level, which allowed the establishment of secondary and tertiary activities: in turn, these boosted the development of trade with the Greek colonies of southern Italy (mainly Ischia and Cumae).', u'All these happenings, which according to the archeological excavations took place more or less around the mid of the 8th century BC, can be considered as the "birth" of the city.', u'Despite recent excavations at the Palatine hill, the view that Rome has been indeed founded with an act of will as the legend suggests in the middle of the 8th century BC (the date of the tradition of Romulus) remains a fringe hypothesis.', u'==== Legend of the founding of Rome ====\n\nTraditional stories handed down by the ancient Romans themselves explain the earliest history of their city in terms of legend and myth.', u'The most familiar of these myths, and perhaps the most famous of all Roman myths, is the story of Romulus and Remus, the twins who were suckled by a she-wolf.', u'They decided to build a city, but after an argument, Romulus killed his brother and the city took his name.', u'According to the Roman annalists, this happened on 21 April 753 BC.', u'This legend had to be reconciled with a dual tradition, set earlier in time, that had the Trojan refugee Aeneas escape to Italy and found the line of Romans through his son Iulus, the namesake of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.', u'This was accomplished by the Roman poet Virgil in the first century BC.', u'=== Monarchy, republic, empire ===\n\nAfter the legendary foundation by Romulus, Rome was ruled for a period of 244 years by a monarchical system, initially with sovereigns of Latin and Sabine origin, later by Etruscan kings.', u'The tradition handed down seven kings: Romulus, Numa Pompilius, Tullus Hostilius, Ancus Marcius, Tarquinius Priscus, Servius Tullius and Tarquinius Superbus.', u'In 509 BC the Romans expelled the last king from their city and established an oligarchic republic.', u'Rome then began a period characterised by internal struggles between patricians (aristocrats) and plebeians (small landowners), and by constant warfare against the populations of central Italy: Etruscans, Latins, Volsci, Aequi, Marsi.', u'After becoming master of Latium, Rome led several wars (against the Gauls, Osci-Samnites and the Greek colony of Taranto, allied with Pyrrhus, king of Epirus) whose result was the conquest of the Italian peninsula, from the central area up to Magna Graecia.', u'The third and second century BC saw the establishment of Roman hegemony over the Mediterranean and the East, through the three Punic Wars (264\u2013146 BC) fought against the city of Carthage and the three Macedonian Wars (212\u2013168 BC) against Macedonia.', u'Then were established the first Roman provinces: Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica, Hispania, Macedonia, Greece (Achaia) and Africa.', u'From the beginning of the 2nd century BC, power was contested between two groups of aristocrats: the optimates, representing the conservative part of the Senate, and the populares, which relied on the help of the plebs (urban lower class) to gain power.', u'In the same period, the bankruptcy of the small farmers and the establishment of large slave estates provoked the migration to the city of a large number of people.', u'The continuous warfare made necessary a professional army, which was more loyal to its generals than to the republic.', u'Due to that, in the second half of the second century and during the first century BC there were conflicts both abroad and internally: after the failed attempt of social reform of the populares Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus, and the war against Jugurtha, there was a first civil war between Gaius Marius and Sulla.', u'To this followed a major slave revolt under Spartacus, and then the establishment of the first Triumvirate with Caesar, Pompey and Crassus.', u'The conquest of Gaul made Caesar immensely powerful and popular, which led to a second civil war against the Senate and Pompey.', u'After his victory, Caesar established himself as dictator for life.', u"His assassination led to a second Triumvirate among Octavian (Caesar's grandnephew and heir), Mark Antony and Lepidus, and to another civil war between Octavian and Antony.", u'The former in 27 BC became princeps civitatis and got the title of Augustus, founding the principate, a diarchy between the princeps and the senate.', u'Rome was established as a de facto empire, which reached its greatest expansion in the second century under the Emperor Trajan, Rome was confirmed as caput Mundi, i.e.', u'the capital of the world, an expression which had already been given in the Republican period.', u'During its first two centuries, the empire saw as rulers, emperors of the Julio-Claudian, Flavian (who also built eponymous amphitheatre, known as the Colosseum) and Antonine dynasties.', u'This time was also characterised by the spread of the Christian religion, preached by Jesus Christ in Judea in the first half of the first century (under Tiberius) and popularized by his apostles through the empire and beyond.', u'The Antonine age is considered the apogee of the Empire, whose territory ranged from the Atlantic Ocean to the Euphrates and from Britain to Egypt.', u'In the third century, at the end of the Antonine dynasty, with the Severan dynasty the principatus was substituted by a military government, which was soon followed by a destabilising period of military anarchy known as the Crisis of the Third Century.', u'At the same time the economy deteriorated, inflation rose and the historical enemies of Rome, the Germanic tribes in the West and the Persian Empire in the East, continued to bear pressure on the frontiers.', u'Emperor Diocletian (284) attempted to alleviate the economic and military problems by introducing the dominate (an absolute monarchy where the emperor was deified), imposing price controls and decentralising the administration: the emperor divided the empire into twelve dioceses, ruling under the title of Augustus the eastern half (with residence in Nicomedia) and naming Maximian Augustus of the western half, whose capital was moved to Mediolanum.', u'The succession was regulated with the creation of the Tetrarchy: each Augustus, in fact, had to appoint a junior emperor, named Caesar, who would rule part of the Roman territory on behalf of his Augustus and who would become, at the end, the new emperor.', u'After the abdication of Diocletian and Maximian in 305 and many dynastic conflicts, this system collapsed, and the new ruler, Constantine, centralised power again and, with the Edict of Milan in 313, gave freedom of worship for Christians, pledging himself to give stability to the new religion.', u'He built several churches, gave the civil power of Rome to Pope Sylvester I and founded in the eastern part a new capital city; Constantinople.', u'Christianity became the official religion of the empire, thanks to an edict issued in 380 by Theodosius, who was the last emperor of a unified empire: after his death, in fact, his sons, Arcadius and Honorius, divided the empire into a western and an eastern part.', u'The capital of the western Roman Empire became Ravenna.', u'Rome, which had lost its central role in the administration of the empire, was sacked in 410 by the Visigoths led by Alaric I, but also embellished by the construction of sacred buildings by the popes (with the collaboration of the emperors).', u'The city, impoverished and depopulated, suffered a new looting in 455, by Genseric, king of the Vandals.', u'The weak emperors of the fifth century could not stop the decay, until the deposition of Romulus Augustus on 22 August 476 marked the end of the Western Roman Empire and, for many historians, the beginning of the Middle Ages.', u'=== Middle Ages ===\n\nThe Bishop of Rome, called the Pope, was important since the early days of Christianity because of the martyrdom of both the apostles Peter and Paul there.', u'The Bishops of Rome were also seen (and still are seen by Catholics) as the successors of Peter; he being the first Bishop of Rome.', u'The city thus became of increasing importance as the centre of the Catholic Church.', u'After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD, Rome was first under the control of Odoacer and then became part of the Ostrogothic Kingdom before returning to East Roman control after the Gothic War, which devastated the city.', u'Its population declined from more than a million in 210 AD to 500,000 in 273 to 35,000 after the Gothic War, reducing the sprawling city to groups of inhabited buildings interspersed among large areas of ruins, vegetation, vineyards and market gardens.', u'After the Lombard invasion of Italy, the city remained nominally Byzantine, but in reality the popes pursued a policy of equilibrium between the Byzantines, the Franks and the Lombards.', u'In 729, the Lombard king Liutprand donated to the church the north Latium town of Sutri, starting the temporal power of the church.', u'In 756, Pepin the Short, after having defeated the Lombards, gave to the Pope temporal jurisdiction over the Roman Duchy and the Exarchate of Ravenna, thus creating the Papal States.', u'Since this period three powers tried to rule the city: the pope, the nobility, together with the chiefs of militias, the judges, the Senate and the populace; and the Frankish king, as king of the Lombards, patricius and Emperor.', u'These three parties (theocratic, republican and imperial) were a characteristic of Roman life during the entire Middle Ages.', u'On the Christmas night of 800, Charlemagne was crowned in Rome as emperor of the Holy Roman Empire by Pope Leo III: on that occasion the city hosted for the first time the two powers whose struggle for the universal power was to be a constant of the Middle Ages.', u"In 846, Muslim Arabs unsuccessfully stormed the city's walls, but managed to loot St. Peter's and St. Paul's basilica, both outside the city wall.", u'After the decay of Carolingian power, Rome fell prey to feudal anarchy: several noble families kept fighting against the pope, the emperor and each other.', u'These were the times of Theodora and her daughter Marozia, concubines and mothers of several popes, and of Crescentius, a powerful feudal lord, who fought against the Emperors Otto II and III.', u'The scandals of this period pushed the papacy to reform itself: the election of the pope was reserved to the cardinals, and a reform of the clergy was attempted.', u'The driving force behind this renewal was the monk Ildebrando da Soana, who once elected pope under the name of Gregory VII became involved into the Investiture Controversy against Emperor Henry IV.', u'Subsequently, Rome was sacked and burned by the Normans of Robert Guiscard who had entered the city in support of the Pope, who was besieged in Castel S. Angelo.', u'During this period, the city was autonomously ruled by a senatore or patrizio: in the 12th century.', u'This administration, as often in the Italian cities, evolved into the commune, a new form of social organisation, expression of the new wealthy classes.', u'Pope Lucius II had already to fight against the Roman commune, and the struggle was continued by his successor pope Eugenius III: then the commune, allied with the nobility, was supported by Arnaldo da Brescia, a monk who was a religious and social reformer.', u"After the pope's death, Arnaldo was taken prisoner by Adrianus IV, which marked the end of the comune's autonomy.", u'Under Pope Innocent III, whose reign marked the apogee of the papacy, the commune liquidated the senate, and replaced it with a Senatore, who was subject to the pope.', u'In this period the papacy played a role of secular importance in Western Europe, often acting as arbitrators between Christian monarchs and exercising additional political powers.', u'In 1266 Charles of Anjou, who was heading south to fight the Hohenstaufen on behalf of the pope, was appointed Senator.', u'Charles founded the Sapienza, the university of Rome.', u'In that period the pope died, and the cardinals, summoned in Viterbo, could not agree on his successor: the people of the city, angered, unroofed the building where they had met, imprisoning them until they had nominated the new pope: this happening marked the birth of the conclave.', u'In this period the city was also shattered by continuous fights among the noble families: Annibaldi, Caetani, Colonna, Orsini, Conti, nested in their fortresses built above ancient Roman edifices, fought each other to control the papacy.', u"Pope Boniface VIII, born Caetani, was the last pope to fight for the church's universal domain: he proclaimed a crusade against the Colonna and in 1300, called for the first Jubilee of Christianity, which brought to Rome millions of pilgrims.", u'However, his hopes were crushed by the French king Philip the Fair, who took him prisoner and slashed him in Anagni, causing his death.', u'Afterwards, a new pope faithful to the French was elected, and the papacy was briefly relocated to Avignon (1309\u20131377).', u'During this period the city was neglected, until the power fell in the hand of a plebeian man, Cola di Rienzo.', u'An idealist and a lover of ancient Rome, Cola dreamed about a rebirth of the Roman Empire: after assuming the power with the title of Tribuno, his reforms were rejected by the populace.', u'Forced to flee, Cola could come back among the suite of cardinal Albornoz, in charge of restoring the church power in Italy.', u'Back in power for a short time, he was lynched by the populace, and Albornoz could take possession of the city, that in 1377 under Gregory XI became again the seat of the papacy.', u'The return of the pope to Rome in that year unleashed the western Schism (1377\u20131418), and during the next forty years, the city was prey of the fights which shattered the church.', u'=== Early modern ===\n\nIn 1418, the Council of Constance settled the Western Schism, and a Roman pope, Martin V, was elected.', u'This brought to Rome a century of internal peace, which marked the beginning of the Renaissance.', u'The ruling popes until the first half of the 16th century, from Nicholas V, founder of the Vatican Library, to Pius II, humanist and literate, from Sixtus IV, a warrior pope, to Alexander VI, immoral and nepotist, from Julius II, soldier and patron, to Leo X, who gave his name to this period ("the century of Leo X"), all devoted their energy to the greatness and the beauty of the Eternal City, to the power of their stock, and to the patronage of the arts.', u'During those years the centre of the Italian Renaissance moved to Rome from Florence.', u"Majestic works, as the new Saint Peter's Basilica, the Sistine Chapel and Ponte Sisto (the first bridge to be built across the Tiber since antiquity, although on Roman foundation) were created.", u'To accomplish that, the Popes engaged the best artists of the time, including Michelangelo, Perugino, Raphael, Ghirlandaio, Luca Signorelli, Botticelli, and Cosimo Rosselli.', u'The period was also infamous for papal corruption, with many Popes fathering children, and engaging in nepotism and simony.', u'The corruption of the Popes and the huge expenses for their building projects led, in part, to the Reformation and, in turn, the Counter-Reformation.', u'Alexander VI, for example, was well known for his decadence, extravagance and immoral life.', u'Under extravagant and rich popes, Rome was transformed into a centre of art, poetry, music, literature, education and culture.', u'Rome became able to compete with other major European cities of the time in terms of wealth, grandeur, the arts, learning and architecture.', u"The Renaissance period changed Rome's face dramatically, with works like the Piet\xe0 by Michelangelo and the frescoes of the Borgia Apartments.", u'Rome reached the highest point of splendour under Pope Julius II (1503\u20131513) and his successors Leo X and Clement VII, both members of the Medici family.', u'In this twenty-year period, Rome became one of the greatest centres of art in the world.', u"The old St. Peter's Basilica built by Emperor Constantine the Great (which by then was in a dilapidated state) was demolished and a new one begun.", u'The city hosted artists like Ghirlandaio, Perugino, Botticelli and Bramante, who built the temple of San Pietro in Montorio and planned a great project to renovate the Vatican.', u"Raphael, who in Rome became one of the most famous painters of Italy, created frescoes in the Villa Farnesina, the Raphael's Rooms, plus many other famous paintings.", u'Michelangelo started the decoration of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and executed the famous statue of the Moses for the tomb of Julius II.', u'Rome lost in part its religious character, becoming increasingly a true Renaissance city, with a great number of popular feasts, horse races, parties, intrigues and licentious episodes.', u'Its economy was rich, with the presence of several Tuscan bankers, including Agostino Chigi, who was a friend of Raphael and a patron of arts.', u'Before his early death, Raphael also promoted for the first time the preservation of the ancient ruins.', u'The fight between France and Spain in Europe caused the first plunder of the city in less than five hundred years after the previous sack.', u'In 1527, the Landsknechts of Emperor Charles V sacked the city, putting to an abrupt end the golden age of the Renaissance in Rome.', u"Beginning with the Council of Trent in 1545, the Church began the Counter-Reformation as an answer to the Reformation, a large-scale questioning of the Church's authority on spiritual matters and governmental affairs.", u'(This loss of confidence then led to major shifts of power away from the Church.)', u"Under the popes from Pius IV to Sixtus V, Rome became the centre of the reformed Catholicism and saw the instalment of new monuments which celebrated the papacy's restored greatness.", u"The popes and cardinals of the 17th and early 18th centuries continued the movement by having the city's landscape enriched with baroque buildings.", u'This was another nepotistic age: the new noble families (Barberini, Pamphili, Chigi, Rospigliosi, Altieri, Odescalchi) were protected by their respective popes, who built for their relatives huge baroque buildings.', u"During the Age of Enlightenment, new ideas reached also the Eternal City, where the papacy supported archaeological studies and improved the people's welfare.", u'But not everything went well for the Church during the Counter-Reformation.', u'There were setbacks in the attempts to restrain the anti-Church policies of European powers of the time, the most notable setback perhaps being in 1773 when Pope Clement XIV was forced by secular powers to have the Jesuit order suppressed.', u'=== Late modern and contemporary ===\nThe rule of the Popes was interrupted by the short-lived Roman Republic (1798\u20131800), which was built under the influence of the French Revolution.', u"The Papal States were restored in June 1800, but during Napoleon's reign Rome was annexed as a D\xe9partement of the French Empire: first as D\xe9partement du Tibre (1808\u201310) and then as D\xe9partement Rome (1810\u201314).", u'After the fall of Napoleon, the Church State under the pope was reinstated through the Congress of Vienna of 1814.', u'In 1849 another Roman Republic arose within the framework of the revolutions of 1848.', u'Two of the most influential figures of the Italian unification, Giuseppe Mazzini and Giuseppe Garibaldi, fought for the short-lived republic.', u'Rome then became the focus of hopes of Italian reunification, as the rest of Italy was reunited as the Kingdom of Italy, with a temporary capital at Florence.', u"In 1861 Rome was declared capital of Italy even though it was still under the Pope's control.", u'During the 1860s, the last vestiges of the Papal States were under French protection, thanks to the foreign policy of Napoleon III.', u'It was only when this was lifted in 1870, owing to the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, that Italian troops were able to capture Rome entering the city through a breach near Porta Pia.', u'Afterwards, Pope Pius IX declared himself as prisoner in the Vatican, and in 1871 the capital of Italy was finally moved from Florence to Rome.', u'Soon after World War I, Rome witnessed the rise of Italian Fascism, led by Benito Mussolini, who marched on the city in 1922, eventually declaring a new Italian Empire and allying Italy with Nazi Germany.', u'Mussolini pulled down large parts of the city centre in order to build wide avenues and squares which were supposed to celebrate the fascist regime and the resurgence of classical Rome.', u"The interwar period saw a rapid growth in the city's population, which surpassed one million inhabitants.", u'In World War II, due to its art treasuries and the presence of Vatican, Rome largely escaped the tragic destiny of other European cities.', u'However, on 19 July 1943 the San Lorenzo district was bombed by Anglo-American forces, resulting in about 3,000 immediate deaths and 11,000 wounded of which another 1,500 died.', u'After the fall of Mussolini and the Italian Armistice on 8 September 1943, the city was occupied by the Germans and declared an open city until its liberation on 4 June 1944.', u'Rome developed momentously after the war, as one of the driving forces behind the "Italian economic miracle" of post-war reconstruction and modernisation in the 1950s and early 1960s.', u'During this period, the years of la dolce vita ("the sweet life"), Rome became a fashionable city, with popular classic films such as Ben Hur, Quo Vadis, Roman Holiday and La Dolce Vita filmed in the city\'s iconic Cinecitt\xe0 film studios.', u'The rising trend in population growth continued until the mid-1980s, when the comune had more than 2.8 million residents.', u'After that, population started to decline slowly as inhabitants began to move to nearby suburbs of Rome.', u'== Government ==\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nRome constitutes a comune speciale, named "Roma Capitale", and is the largest both in terms of land area and population among the 8,101 comuni of Italy.', u'It is governed by a mayor and a city council.', u'The seat of the comune is the Palazzo Senatorio on the Capitoline Hill, the historic seat of the city government.', u'The local administration in Rome is commonly referred to as "Campidoglio", the Italian name of the hill.', u'==== Administrative and historical subdivisions ====\n\nSince 1972 the city has been divided into administrative areas, called municipi (sing.', u'municipio) (until 2001 named circoscrizioni).', u'They were created for administrative reasons to increase decentralisation in the city.', u'Each municipio is governed by a president and a council of four members who are elected by its residents every five years.', u'The municipi frequently cross the boundaries of the traditional, non-administrative divisions of the city.', u'The municipi where originally 20, then 19.', u'In 2013 their number has been reduced to 15.', u'Rome is also divided into differing types of non-administrative units.', u'The historic centre is divided into 22 rioni, all of which are located within the Aurelian Walls except Prati and Borgo.', u'These originate from the Regiones of ancient Rome, which evolved in the Middle Ages into the medieval rioni.', u'In the Renaissance, under Pope Sixtus V, they reached again the number of fourteen, and their boundaries were finally defined under Pope Benedict XIV in 1743.', u'A new subdivision of the city under Napoleon was ephemeral, and there were no sensible changes in the organisation of the city until 1870, when Rome became the third capital of Italy.', u'The needs of the new capital led to an explosion both in the urbanisation and in the population within and outside the Aurelian walls.', u'In 1874 a fifteenth rione, Esquilino, was created on the newly urbanised zone of Monti.', u'At the beginning of the 20th century other rioni where created (the last one was Prati \u2013 the only one outside the Walls of Pope Urban VIII \u2013 in 1921).', u'Afterward, for the new administrative subdivisions of the city the name "quartiere" was used.', u'Today all the rioni are part of the first Municipio, which therefore coincides completely with the historical city (Centro Storico).', u'=== Metropolitan and regional government ===\nRome is the principal town of the Metropolitan City of Rome, operative since 1 January 2015.', u"The Metropolitan City replaced the old province, which included the city's metropolitan area and extends further north until Civitavecchia.", u'The Metropolitan City of Rome is the largest by area in Italy.', u'At 5,352 square kilometres (2,066 sq mi), its dimensions are comparable to the region of Liguria.', u'Moreover, the city is also the capital of the Lazio region.', u'=== National government ===\nRome is the national capital of Italy and is the seat of the Italian Government.', u'The official residences of the President of the Italian Republic and the Italian Prime Minister, the seats of both houses of the Italian Parliament and that of the Italian Constitutional Court are located in the historic centre.', u'The state ministries are spread out around the city; these include the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is located in Palazzo della Farnesina near the Olympic stadium.', u'== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nRome is in the Lazio region of central Italy on the Tiber river (Italian: Tevere).', u'The original settlement developed on hills that faced onto a ford beside the Tiber Island, the only natural ford of the river in this area.', u'The Rome of the Kings was built on seven hills: the Aventine Hill, the Caelian Hill, the Capitoline Hill, the Esquiline Hill, the Palatine Hill, the Quirinal Hill, and the Viminal Hill.', u'Modern Rome is also crossed by another river, the Aniene, which flows into the Tiber north of the historic centre.', u'Although the city centre is about 24 kilometres (15 mi) inland from the Tyrrhenian Sea, the city territory extends to the shore, where the south-western district of Ostia is located.', u'The altitude of the central part of Rome ranges from 13 metres (43 ft) above sea level (at the base of the Pantheon) to 139 metres (456 ft) above sea level (the peak of Monte Mario).', u'The Comune of Rome covers an overall area of about 1,285 square kilometres (496 sq mi), including many green areas.', u'=== Topography ===\n\nThroughout the history of Rome, the urban limits of the city were considered to be the area within the city walls.', u'Originally, these consisted of the Servian Wall, which was built twelve years after the Gaulish sack of the city in 390 BC.', u'This contained most of the Esquiline and Caelian hills, as well as the whole of the other five.', u'Rome outgrew the Servian Wall, but no more walls were constructed until almost 700 years later, when, in 270 AD, Emperor Aurelian began building the Aurelian Walls.', u'These were almost 19 kilometres (12 mi) long, and were still the walls the troops of the Kingdom of Italy had to breach to enter the city in 1870.', u'The city\'s urban area is cut in two by its ring-road, the Grande Raccordo Anulare ("GRA"), finished in 1962, which circles the city centre at a distance of about 10 km (6 mi).', u'Although when the ring was completed most part of the inhabited area lay inside it (one of the few exceptions was the former village of Ostia, which lies along the tyrrhenian coast), in the meantime quarters have been built which extend up to 20 km (12 mi) beyond it.', u'The comune covers an area roughly three times the total area within the Raccordo and is comparable in area to the entire metropolitan cities of Milan and Naples, and to an area six times the size of the territory of these cities.', u'It also includes considerable areas of abandoned marsh land which is suitable neither for agriculture nor for urban development.', u'As a consequence, the density of the comune is not that high, its territory being divided between highly urbanised areas and areas designated as parks, nature reserves, and for agricultural use.', u'== Climate ==\n\nRome enjoys a Mediterranean climate (K\xf6ppen climate classification: Csa), with cool, humid winters and hot, dry summers.', u'Its average annual temperature is above 20 \xb0C (68 \xb0F) during the day and 10 \xb0C (50 \xb0F) at night.', u'In the coldest month \u2013 January, the average temperature is 12 \xb0C (54 \xb0F) during the day and 3 \xb0C (37 \xb0F) at night.', u'In the warmest months \u2013 July and August, the average temperature is 30 \xb0C (86 \xb0F) during the day and 18 \xb0C (64 \xb0F) at night.', u'December, January and February are the coldest months, with a daily mean temperature of 8 \xb0C (46 \xb0F).Temperatures during these months generally vary between 10 and 15 \xb0C (50 and 59 \xb0F) during the day and between 3 and 5 \xb0C (37 and 41 \xb0F) at night, with colder or warmer spells occurring frequently.', u'Snowfall is rare but not unheard of, with light snow or flurries occurring almost every winter, generally without accumulation, and major snowfalls once every 20 or 25 years (the last one in 2012).', u'The average relative humidity is 75%, varying from 72% in July to 77% in November.', u'Sea temperatures vary from a low of 13 \xb0C (55 \xb0F) in February and March to a high of 24 \xb0C (75 \xb0F) in August.', u'== Demographics ==\n\nIn 550 BC Rome was the second largest city in Italy, with Tarentum being the largest.', u'It had an area of about 285 hectares (700 acres) and an estimated population of 35,000.', u'Other sources suggest the population was just under 100,000 from 600\u2013500 BC.', u'When the Republic was founded in 509 BC the census recorded a population of 130,000.', u'The republic included the city itself and the immediate surroundings.', u'Other sources suggest a population of 150,000 in 500 BC.', u'It surpassed 300,000 in 150 BC.', u'The size of the city at the time of the Emperor Augustus is a matter of speculation, with estimates based on grain distribution, grain imports, aqueduct capacity, city limits, population density, census reports, and assumptions about the number of unreported women, children and slaves providing a very wide range.', u'Glenn Storey estimates 450,000 people, Whitney Oates estimates 1.2 million, Neville Morely provides a rough estimate of 800,000 and excludes earlier suggestions of 2 million.', u"After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the city's population declined to less than 50,000 people.", u'It continued to stagnate or shrink until the Renaissance.', u'When the Kingdom of Italy annexed Rome in 1870, the city had a population of about 200,000.', u'This increased to 600,000 by the eve of World War I.', u'The Fascist regime of Mussolini tried to block an excessive demographic rise of the city, but failed to prevent it from reaching one million people by the early 1930s.', u'Population growth continued after the Second World War, helped by a post-war economic boom.', u'A construction boom also created a large number of suburbs during the 1950s and 1960s.', u'In mid-2010, there were 2,754,440 residents in the city proper, while some 4.2 million people lived in the greater Rome area (which can be approximately identified with its administrative metropolitan city, with a population density of about 800inhab./km2 stretching over more than 5,000 km\xb2).', u'Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled 17.00% of the population compared to pensioners who number 20.76%.', u'This compares with the Italian average of 18.06% (minors) and 19.94% (pensioners).', u'The average age of a Roman resident is 43 compared to the Italian average of 42.', u'In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Rome grew by 6.54%, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.56%.', u'The current birth rate of Rome is 9.10 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.', u'The urban area of Rome extends beyond the administrative city limits with a population of around 3.9 million.', u'Between 3.2 and 4.2 million people live in the Rome metropolitan area.', u'=== Ethnic groups ===\nAccording to the latest statistics conducted by ISTAT, approximately 9.5% of the population consists of non-Italians.', u'About half of the immigrant population consists of those of various other European origins (chiefly Romanian, Polish, Ukrainian, and Albanian) numbering a combined total of 131,118 or 4.7% of the population.', u'The remaining 4.8% are those with non-European origins, chiefly Filipinos (26,933), Bangladeshis (12,154), and Chinese (10,283).', u'The Esquilino rione, off Termini Railway Station, has evolved into a largely immigrant neighbourhood.', u"It is perceived as Rome's Chinatown.", u'Immigrants from more than a hundred different countries reside there.', u'A commercial district, Esquilino contains restaurants featuring many kinds of international cuisine.', u'There are wholesale clothes shops.', u'Of the 1,300 or so commercial premises operating in the district 800 are Chinese-owned; around 300 are run by immigrants from other countries around the world; 200 are owned by Italians.', u'== Religion ==\n\nMuch like the rest of Italy, Rome is predominantly Roman Catholic, and the city has been an important centre of religion and pilgrimage for centuries, the base of the ancient Roman Religion with the pontifex maximus and later the seat of the Vatican and the pope.', u'Before the arrival of the Christians in Rome, the Religio Romana (literally, the "Roman Religion") was the major religion of the city in classical antiquity.', u"The first gods held sacred by the Romans were Jupiter, the most high, and Mars, god of war, and father of Rome's twin founders, Romulus and Remus, according to tradition.", u'Other gods and goddesses such as Vesta and Minerva were honoured.', u'Rome was also the base of several mystery cults, such as Mithraism.', u"Later, after St Peter and St Paul were martyred in the city, and the first Christians began to arrive, Rome became Christian, and the Old St. Peter's Basilica was constructed in 313 AD.", u'Despite some interruptions (such as the Avignon papacy), Rome has for centuries been the home of the Roman Catholic Church and the Bishop of Rome, otherwise known as the Pope.', u"Despite the fact that Rome is home to the Vatican City and St. Peter's Basilica, Rome's cathedral is the Basilica of St. John Lateran, located to the south-east of the city-centre.", u'There are around 900 churches in Rome in total, aside from the cathedral itself, some others of note include: the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls, the Basilica di San Clemente, San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane and the Church of the Gesu.', u'There are also the ancient Catacombs of Rome underneath the city.', u'Numerous highly important religious educational institutions are also in Rome, such as the Pontifical Lateran University, Pontifical Biblical Institute, Pontifical Gregorian University, and Pontifical Oriental Institute.', u"In recent years, there has been a significant growth in Rome's Muslim community, mainly due to immigration from North African and Middle Eastern countries into the city.", u'As a result of this increase of the local practitioners of the Islamic faith, the comune promoted the building of the Mosque of Rome, which is the largest mosque in Western Europe, that was designed by architect Paolo Portoghesi and inaugurated on 21 June 1995.', u'Since the end of the Roman Republic, Rome is also the centre of an important Jewish community, which was once based in Trastevere, and later in the Roman Ghetto.', u'There lies also the major synagogue in Rome, the Tempio Maggiore.', u"=== Vatican City ===\n\nThe territory of Vatican City is part of the Mons Vaticanus (Vatican Hill), and of the adjacent former Vatican Fields, where St. Peter's Basilica, the Apostolic Palace, the Sistine Chapel, and museums were built, along with various other buildings.", u'The area was part of the Roman rione of Borgo until 1929.', u'Being separated from the city on the west bank of the Tiber river, the area was a suburb that was protected by being included within the walls of Leo IV, later expanded by the current fortification walls of Paul III/Pius IV/Urban VIII.', u'When the Lateran Treaty of 1929 that created the Vatican state was being prepared, the boundaries of the proposed territory were influenced by the fact that much of it was all but enclosed by this loop.', u'For some tracts of the frontier, there was no wall, but the line of certain buildings supplied part of the boundary, and for a small part of the frontier a modern wall was constructed.', u"The territory includes Saint Peter's Square, separated from the territory of Italy only by a white line along the limit of the square, where it borders Piazza Pio XII.", u"St. Peter's Square is reached through the Via della Conciliazione, which runs from the Tiber River to St. Peter's.", u'This grand approach was designed by architects Piacentini and Spaccarelli, for want of Benito Mussolini and in accordance with the church, after the conclusion of the Lateran Treaty.', u'According to the Lateran Treaty, certain properties of the Holy See located in Italian territory, most notably the Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo and the major basilicas, enjoy extraterritorial status similar to that of foreign embassies.', u'=== Pilgrimage ===\nRome has been a major Christian pilgrimage site since the Middle Ages.', u'People from all over the Christian world visit Vatican City, within the city of Rome, the seat of the papacy.', u'The Pope was the most influential figure during the Middle Ages.', u'The city became a major pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages and the focus of struggles between the Papacy and the Holy Roman Empire starting with Charlemagne, who was crowned its first emperor in Rome in 800 by Pope Leo III.', u'Apart from brief periods as an independent city during the Middle Ages, Rome kept its status as Papal capital and "holy city" for centuries, even when the Papacy briefly relocated to Avignon (1309\u20131377).', u'Catholics believe that the Vatican is the last resting place of St. Peter.', u'Pilgrimages to Rome can involve visits to a large number of sites, both within the Vatican City and in Italian territory.', u"A popular stopping point is the Pilate's stairs: these are, according to the Christian tradition, the steps that led up to the praetorium of Pontius Pilate in Jerusalem, which Jesus Christ stood on during his Passion on his way to trial.", u'The stairs were, reputedly, brought to Rome by St. Helena in the 4th Century.', u'For centuries, the Scala Santa has attracted Christian pilgrims who wished to honour the Passion of Jesus.', u"Object of pilgrimage are also several catacombs built in the Roman age, in which Christians prayed, buried their dead and performed worship during periods of persecution, and various national churches (among them San Luigi dei francesi and Santa Maria dell'Anima), or churches associated with individual religious orders, such as the Jesuit Churches of Jesus and Sant`Ignazio.", u'Traditionally, pilgrims in Rome and Roman citizens thanking God for a grace should visit by foot the seven pilgrim churches (Italian: Le sette chiese) in 24 hours.', u'This custom, mandatory for each pilgrim in the Middle Ages, was codified in the 16th century by Saint Philip Neri.', u'The seven churches are the four major Basilicas (St Peter in Vatican, St Paul outside the Walls, St John in Lateran and Santa Maria Maggiore), while the other three are San Lorenzo fuori le mura (a palaeochristian Basilica), Santa Croce in Gerusalemme (a church founded by Helena, the mother of Constantine, which hosts fragments of wood attributed to the holy cross) and San Sebastiano fuori le mura (which lies on the Appian Way and is built above Roman catacombs).', u"== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nRome's architecture over the centuries has greatly developed, especially from the Classical and Imperial Roman styles to modern Fascist architecture.", u"Rome was for a period one of the world's main epicentres of classical architecture, developing new forms such as the arch, the dome and the vault.", u'The Romanesque style in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries was also widely used in Roman architecture, and later the city became one of the main centres of Renaissance, Baroque and neoclassic architecture.', u'==== Ancient Rome ====\n\nOne of the symbols of Rome is the Colosseum (70\u201380 AD), the largest amphitheatre ever built in the Roman Empire.', u'Originally capable of seating 60,000 spectators, it was used for gladiatorial combat.', u"A list of important monuments and sites of ancient Rome includes the Roman Forum, the Domus Aurea, the Pantheon, Trajan's Column, Trajan's Market, the Catacombs, the Circus Maximus, the Baths of Caracalla, Castel Sant'Angelo, the Mausoleum of Augustus, the Ara Pacis, the Arch of Constantine, the Pyramid of Cestius, and the Bocca della Verit\xe0.", u'==== Medieval ====\nThe middle age boroughs of the city, lying mainly around the Capitol, have been largely pulled down between the end of the 19th century and the fascist period, but many notable buildings still stay.', u'Basilicas dating from the Palaeochristian age include Santa Maria Maggiore and San Paolo Fuori le Mura (the latter largely rebuilt in the 19th century), both housing precious 4th century AD mosaics.', u'Later notable medieval mosaic and fresco art can be also found in the churches of Santa Maria in Trastevere, Santi Quattro Coronati, and Santa Prassede.', u'Lay buildings include a number of towers, the largest being the Torre delle Milizie and the Torre dei Conti, both next the Roman Forum, and the huge staircase leading to the basilica of Santa Maria in Ara Coeli.', u'==== Renaissance and Baroque ====\nRome was a major world centre of the Renaissance, second only to Florence, and was profoundly affected by the movement.', u'Among others, a masterpiece of Renaissance architecture in Rome is the Piazza del Campidoglio by Michelangelo.', u'During this period, the great aristocratic families of Rome used to build opulent dwellings as the Palazzo del Quirinale (now seat of the President of the Italian Republic), the Palazzo Venezia, the Palazzo Farnese, the Palazzo Barberini, the Palazzo Chigi (now seat of the Italian Prime Minister), the Palazzo Spada, the Palazzo della Cancelleria, and the Villa Farnesina.', u"Many of the famous city's squares \u2013 some huge, majestic and often adorned with obelisks, some small and picturesque \u2013 got their present shape during the Renaissance and Baroque.", u"The principal ones are Piazza Navona, Piazza di Spagna, Campo de' Fiori, Piazza Venezia, Piazza Farnese, Piazza della Rotonda and Piazza della Minerva.", u'One of the most emblematic examples of Baroque art is the Fontana di Trevi by Nicola Salvi.', u'Other notable 17th-century baroque palaces are the Palazzo Madama, now the seat of the Italian Senate and the Palazzo Montecitorio, now the seat of the Chamber of Deputies of Italy.', u'==== Neoclassicism ====\n\nIn 1870, Rome became the capital city of the new Kingdom of Italy.', u'During this time, neoclassicism, a building style influenced by the architecture of antiquity, became a predominant influence in Roman architecture.', u'During this period, many great palaces in neoclassical styles were built to host ministries, embassies, and other governing agencies.', u'One of the best-known symbols of Roman neoclassicism is the Monument of Vittorio Emanuele II or "Altar of the Fatherland", where the Grave of the Unknown Soldier, that represents the 650,000 Italians that fell in World War I, is located.', u'==== Fascist architecture ====\n\nThe Fascist regime that ruled in Italy between 1922 and 1943 had its showcase in Rome.', u'Mussolini let build new avenues and piazzas, obtained through the destruction of roads, houses, churches and palaces erected during the papal rule.', u'The main enterprises during his government were: the "isolation" of the Capitoline Hill; Via dei Monti, later renamed Via del\'Impero, and finally Via dei Fori Imperiali; Via del Mare, later renamed Via del Teatro di Marcello; the "isolation" of the Mausoleum of Augustus, with the erection of Piazza Augusto Imperatore; Via della Conciliazione.', u'Architectonically, Fascism in a first stage favoured the most modern movements, like the Rationalism.', u'Parallel to it, in the 1920s another style emerged, named "Stile Novecento", characterised by its links with ancient Roman architecture.', u'One important realisation in the latter style is the Foro Mussolini, now Foro Italico, by Enrico Del Debbio.', u'Next to it, the most important Fascist site in Rome is the EUR district, designed in 1938 by Marcello Piacentini.', u'This new quarter emerged as a compromise between Rationalist and Novecento architects, the former being led by Giuseppe Pagano.', u'The EUR was originally conceived for the 1942 world exhibition, and was called "E.42" ("Esposizione 42").', u'The most representative buildings of EUR are the Palazzo della Civilt\xe0 Italiana (1938\u20131943), the iconic design of which has been labelled the cubic of Square Colosseum, and the Palazzo dei Congressi, example of Rationalist style.', u'The world exhibition, however, never took place because Italy entered the Second World War in 1940, and the realised buildings were partly destroyed in 1943 during the fighting between Italian and German army after the armistice and later abandoned.', u'The quarter was restored in the 1950s, when the Roman authorities found that they already had the seed of an off-centre business district of the type that other capitals were still planning (London Docklands and La D\xe9fense in Paris).', u'Also the Palazzo della Farnesina, the current seat of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was designed in 1935 in pure Fascist style.', u'=== Parks and gardens ===\n\nPublic parks and nature reserves cover a large area in Rome, and the city has one of the largest areas of green space among European capitals.', u'The most notable part of this green space is represented by the large number of villas and landscaped gardens created by the Italian aristocracy.', u'While most of the parks surrounding the villas were destroyed during the building boom of the late 19th century, some of them remain.', u'The most notable of these are Villa Borghese, Villa Ada, and Villa Doria Pamphili.', u'Villa Doria Pamphili is west of the Gianicolo hill comprising some 1.8 square kilometres (0.7 sq mi).', u'Also on the Gianicolo hill there is Villa Sciarra, with playgrounds for children and shaded walking areas.', u'In the nearby area of Trastevere the Orto Botanico (Botanical Garden) is a cool and shady green space.', u"The old Roman hippodrome (Circus Maximus) is another large green space: it has few trees, but is overlooked by the Palatine and the Rose Garden ('roseto comunale').", u'Nearby is the lush Villa Celimontana, close to the gardens surrounding the Baths of Caracalla.', u'The Villa Borghese garden is the best known large green space in Rome, with famous art galleries among its shaded walks.', u'Overlooking Piazza del Popolo and the Spanish Steps are the gardens of Pincio and Villa Medici.', u'Noteworthy is also the Pine wood of Castelfusano, near Ostia.', u'Rome also has a number of regional parks of much more recent origin including the Pineto Regional Park and the Appian Way Regional Park.', u'There are also nature reserves at Marcigliana and at Tenuta di Castelporziano.', u'=== Fountains and aqueducts ===\n\nRome is a city famous for its numerous fountains, built in all different styles, from Classical and Medieval, to Baroque and Neoclassical.', u'The city has had fountains for more than two thousand years, and they have provided drinking water and decorated the piazzas of Rome.', u'During the Roman Empire, in 98 AD, according to Sextus Julius Frontinus, the Roman consul who was named curator aquarum or guardian of the water of the city, Rome had nine aqueducts which fed 39 monumental fountains and 591 public basins, not counting the water supplied to the Imperial household, baths and owners of private villas.', u'Each of the major fountains was connected to two different aqueducts, in case one was shut down for service.', u'During the 17th and 18th century the Roman popes reconstructed other ruined Roman aqueducts and built new display fountains to mark their termini, launching the golden age of the Roman fountain.', u'The fountains of Rome, like the paintings of Rubens, were expressions of the new style of Baroque art.', u'They were crowded with allegorical figures, and filled with emotion and movement.', u'In these fountains, sculpture became the principal element, and the water was used simply to animate and decorate the sculptures.', u'They, like baroque gardens, were "a visual representation of confidence and power".', u'=== Statues ===\n\nRome is well known for its statues but, in particular, the talking statues of Rome.', u'These are usually ancient statues which have become popular soapboxes for political and social discussion, and places for people to (often satirically) voice their opinions.', u'There are two main talking statues: the Pasquino and the Marforio, yet there are four other noted ones: il Babuino, Madama Lucrezia, il Facchino and Abbot Luigi.', u'Most of these statues are ancient Roman or classical, and most of them also depict mythical gods, ancient people or legendary figures; il Pasquino represents Menelaus, Abbot Luigi is an unknown Roman magistrate, il Babuino is supposed to be Silenus, Marforio represents Oceanus, Madama Lucrezia is a bust of Isis, and il Facchino is the only non-Roman statue, created in 1580, and not representing anyone in particular.', u'They are often, due to their status, covered with placards or graffiti expressing political ideas and points of view.', u"Other statues in the city, which are not related to the talking statues, include those of the Ponte Sant'Angelo, or several monuments scattered across the city, such as that to Giordano Bruno in the Campo de'Fiori.", u'=== Obelisks and columns ===\n\nThe city hosts eight ancient Egyptian and five ancient Roman obelisks, together with a number of more modern obelisks; there was also formerly (until 2005) an ancient Ethiopian obelisk in Rome.', u"The city contains some of obelisks in piazzas, such as in Piazza Navona, St Peter's Square, Piazza Montecitorio, and Piazza del Popolo, and others in villas, thermae parks and gardens, such as in Villa Celimontana, the Baths of Diocletian, and the Pincian Hill.", u"Moreover, the centre of Rome hosts also Trajan's and Antonine Column, two ancient Roman columns with spiral relief.", u'=== Bridges ===\n\nThe city of Rome contains numerous famous bridges which cross the Tiber.', u'The only bridge to remain unaltered until today from the classical age is Ponte dei Quattro Capi, which connects the Isola Tiberina with the left bank.', u"The other surviving \u2013 albeit modified \u2013 ancient Roman bridges crossing the Tiber are Ponte Cestio, Ponte Sant'Angelo and Ponte Milvio.", u'Considering Ponte Nomentano, also built during ancient Rome, which crosses the Aniene, currently there are five ancient Roman bridges still remaining in the city.', u'Other noteworthy bridges are Ponte Sisto, the first bridge built in the Renaissance above Roman foundations; Ponte Rotto, actually the only remaining arch of the ancient Pons Aemilius, collapsed during the flood of 1598 and demolished at the end of the 19th century; and Ponte Vittorio Emanuele II, a modern bridge connecting Corso Vittorio Emanuele and Borgo.', u"Most of the city's public bridges were built in Classical or Renaissance style, but also in Baroque, Neoclassical and Modern styles.", u"According to the Encyclop\xe6dia Britannica, the finest ancient bridge remaining in Rome is the Ponte Sant'Angelo, which was completed in 135 AD, and was decorated with ten statues of the angels, designed by Bernini in 1688.", u'=== Catacombs ===\n\nRome has extensive amount of ancient catacombs, or underground burial places under or near the city, of which there are at least forty, some discovered only in recent decades.', u'Though most famous for Christian burials, they include pagan and Jewish burials, either in separate catacombs or mixed together.', u'The first large-scale catacombs were excavated from the 2nd century onwards.', u'Originally they were carved through tuff, a soft volcanic rock, outside the boundaries of the city, because Roman law forbade burial places within city limits.', u'Currently maintenance of the catacombs is in the hands of the Papacy which has invested in the Salesians of Don Bosco the supervision of the Catacombs of St. Callixtus on the outskirts of Rome.', u'== Economy ==\n\nBeing the capital city of Italy, Rome hosts all the principal institutions of the nation, like the Presidency of the Republic, the government (and its single Ministeri), the Parliament, the main judicial Courts, and the diplomatic representatives of all the countries for the states of Italy and the Vatican City (curiously, Rome also hosts, in the Italian part of its territory, the Embassy of Italy for the Vatican City, a unique case of an Embassy within the boundaries of its own country).', u'Many international institutions are located in Rome, notably cultural

in 2014 as 32nd in the Global Cities Index, being the highest-ranking city in Italy.', u'With a 2005 GDP of \u20ac94.376 billion (US$121.5 billion), the city produces 6.7% of the national GDP (more than any other single city in Italy), and its unemployment rate, lowered from 11.1% to 6.5% between 2001 and 2005, is now one of the lowest rates of all the European Union capital cities.', u'Rome grows +4.4% annually and continues to grow at a higher rate in comparison to any other city in the rest of the country.', u"This means that were Rome a country, it would be the world's 52nd richest country by GDP, near to the size to that of Egypt.", u'Rome also had a 2003 GDP per capita of \u20ac29,153 (US$37,412), which was second in Italy, (after Milan), and is more than 134.1% of the EU

GDP amounting to $167.8 billion, and $38,765 per capita.', u'Although the economy of Rome is characterised by the absence of heavy industry and it is largely dominated by services, high-technology companies (IT, aerospace, defence, telecommunications), research, construction and commercial activities (especially banking), and the huge development of tourism are very dynamic and extremely important to its economy.', u"Rome's international airport, Fiumicino, is the largest in Italy, and the city hosts the head offices of the vast majority of the major Italian companies, as well as the headquarters of three of the world's 100 largest companies: Enel, Eni, and Telecom Italia.", u'Universities, national radio and television and the movie industry in Rome are also important parts of the economy: Rome is also the hub of the Italian film industry, thanks to the Cinecitt\xe0 studios, working since the 1930s.', u'The city is also a centre for banking and insurance as well as electronics, energy, transport, and aerospace industries.', u"Numerous international companies and agencies headquarters, government ministries, conference centres, sports venues, and museums are

term also refers to the music they produced.', u'Many of the composers had a direct connection to the Vatican and the papal chapel, though they worked at several churches; stylistically they are often contrasted with the Venetian School of composers, a concurrent movement which was much more progressive.', u'By far the most famous composer of the Roman School is Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, whose name has been associated for four hundred years with smooth, clear, polyphonic perfection.', u'However, there were other composers working in Rome, and in a variety of styles and forms.', u'=== Tourism ===\n\nRome today is one of the most important tourist destinations of the world, due to the incalculable immensity of its archaeological and artistic treasures, as well as for the charm of its unique traditions, the beauty of its panoramic views, and the majesty of its magnificent "villas" (parks).', u'Among the most significant resources are the many museums \u2013 Musei Capitolini, the Vatican Museums and the Galleria Borghese and others dedicated to modern and contemporary art \u2013 aqueducts, fountains, churches, palaces, historical buildings, the monuments and ruins of the Roman Forum, and the Catacombs.', u'Rome is the third most visited city in the EU, after London and Paris, and receives an average of 7\u201310 million tourists a year, which sometimes doubles on holy years.', u'The Colosseum (4 million tourists) and the Vatican Museums (4.2 million tourists) are the 39th and 37th (respectively) most visited places in the world, according to a recent study.',

Academy in Rome, and The Swedish Institute at Rome.', u"Rome contains numerous ancient sites, including the Forum Romanum, Trajan's Market, Trajan's Forum, the Colosseum, and the Pantheon, to name but a few.", u"The Colosseum, arguably one of Rome's most iconic archaeological sites, is regarded as a wonder of the world.", u'Rome contains a vast and impressive collection of art, sculpture, fountains, mosaics, frescos, and paintings, from all different periods.', u'Rome first became a major artistic centre during ancient Rome, with forms of important Roman art such as architecture, painting, sculpture and mosaic work.', u"Metal-work, coin die and gem engraving, ivory carvings, figurine glass, pottery, and book illustrations are considered to be 'minor' forms of Roman artwork.", u'Rome later became a major centre of Renaissance art, since the popes spent vast sums of money for the constructions of grandiose basilicas, palaces, piazzas and public buildings in general.', u"Rome became one of Europe's major centres of Renaissance artwork, second only to Florence, and able to compare to other major cities and cultural centres, such as Paris and Venice.", u'The city was affected greatly by the baroque, and Rome became the home of numerous artists and architects, such as Bernini, Caravaggio, Carracci, Borromini and Cortona.', u'In the late 18th century and early 19th century, the city was one of the centres of the Grand Tour, when wealthy, young English and other European aristocrats visited the city to learn about ancient Roman culture, art, philosophy and architecture.', u'Rome hosted a great number of neoclassical and rococo artists, such as Pannini and Bernardo Bellotto.', u'Today, the city is a major artistic centre, with numerous art institutes and

huge translucent container inside which is suspended a steel and teflon structure resembling a cloud and which contains meeting rooms and an auditorium with two piazzas open to the neighbourhood on either side.', u'=== Fashion ===\nRome is also widely recognised as a world fashion capital.', u'Although not as important as Milan, Rome is the fourth most important centre for fashion in the world, according to the 2009 Global Language Monitor after Milan, New York and Paris, and beating London.', u'Major luxury fashion houses and jewellery chains, such as Valentino, Bulgari, Fendi, Laura Biagiotti and Brioni, are headquartered or were founded in the city.', u'Also, other major labels, such as Chanel, Prada, Dolce & Gabbana, Armani and Versace have luxury boutiques in Rome, primarily along its prestigious and upscale Via dei Condotti.', u"=== Cuisine ===\n\nRome's cuisine has evolved through centuries and periods of social, cultural, and political changes.", u'Rome became a major gastronomical centre during the ancient Age.', u"Ancient Roman cuisine was highly influenced by Ancient Greek culture, and after, the empire's enormous expansion exposed Romans to many new, provincial culinary habits and cooking techniques.", u'Later, during the Renaissance, Rome became well known as a centre of high-cuisine, since some of the best chefs of the time, worked for the popes.', u"An example of this could be Bartolomeo Scappi, who was a chef, working for Pius IV in the Vatican kitchen, and he acquired fame in 1570 when his cookbook Opera dell'arte del cucinare was published.", u'In the book he lists approximately 1000 recipes of the Renaissance cuisine and describes cooking techniques and tools, giving the first known picture of a fork.', u'In the modern age, the city developed its own peculiar cuisine, based on products of the nearby Campagna, as lamb and vegetables (globe artichokes are common).', u'In parallel, Roman Jews -present in the city since the 1st century BC- developed their own cuisine, the cucina giudaico-romanesca.', u'Examples of Roman dishes include "Saltimbocca alla Romana" \u2013 a veal cutlet, Roman-style; topped with raw ham and sage and simmered with white wine and butter; "Carciofi alla romana" \u2013 artichokes Roman-style; outer leaves removed, stuffed with mint, garlic, breadcrumbs and braised; "Carciofi alla giudia" \u2013

production facility in continental Europe and the centre of the Italian cinema, where a large number of today's biggest box office hits are filmed.", u'The 99-acre (40 ha) studio complex is 9.0 kilometres (5.6 mi) from the centre of Rome and is part of one of the biggest production communities in the world, second only to Hollywood, with well over 5,000 professionals \u2013 from period costume makers to visual effects specialists.', u"More than 3,000 productions have been made on its lot, from recent features like The Passion of the Christ, Gangs of New York, HBO's Rome, The Life Aquatic and Dino De Laurentiis' Decameron, to such cinema classics as Ben-Hur, Cleopatra, and the films of Federico Fellini.", u'Founded in 1937 by Benito Mussolini, the studios were bombed by the Western Allies during the Second World War.', u'In the 1950s, Cinecitt\xe0 was the filming location for several large American film productions, and subsequently became the studio most closely associated with Federico Fellini.', u'Today Cinecitt\xe0 is the only studio in the world with pre-production, production, and full post-production facilities on one lot, allowing directors and producers to walk in with their script and "walk out" with a completed film.', u'=== Language ===\n\nAlthough associated today only with Latin, ancient Rome was in fact multilingual.', u'In highest antiquity Sabine tribes shared the area of what is today Rome with Latin tribes.', u'The Sabine language was one of the Italic group of ancient Italian languages, along with Etruscan, which would have been the main language of the last three kings who ruled the city till the founding of the Republic in 509 BC.', u"Urganilla, or Plautia Urgulanilla, wife of Emperor Claudius, is thought to have been a speaker of Etruscan many centuries after this date, according to Suetonius' entry on Claudius.", u'However Latin, in various evolving forms, was the main language of classical Rome, but as the city had immigrants, slaves, residents, ambassadors from many parts of the world it was also multilingual.', u'Many educated Romans also spoke Greek, and there was a large Greek, Syriac and Jewish population in parts of Rome from well before the Empire.', u'Latin evolved during the Middle Ages into a new language, the volgare.', u'The latter emerged as the confluence of various regional dialects, among which the Tuscan dialect predominated, but the population of Rome also developed its own dialect, the Romanesco.', u'The Romanesco spoken during the Middle Ages was a southern Italian dialect, very close to the Neapolitan.', u'The influence of the Florentine culture during the renaissance, and, above all, the immigration to Rome of many Florentines following the two Medici Popes (Leo X and Clement VII), caused a major shift in the dialect, which began to resemble more the Tuscan varieties.', u'This remained largely confined to Rome until the 19th century, but then expanded to other zones of Lazio (Civitavecchia, Latina), from the beginning of the 20th century, thanks to the rising population of Rome and to better transportation systems.', u'As a consequence of education and media like radio and television, Romanesco became more and more similar to standard Italian.', u'Dialectal literature in the traditional form Romanesco includes the works of such authors as Giuseppe Gioachino Belli (one of the most important Italian poets altogether), Trilussa, and Cesare Pascarella.', u'Contemporary Romanesco is mainly represented by popular actors such as Aldo Fabrizi, Alberto Sordi, Nino Manfredi, Anna Magnani, Gigi Proietti, Enrico Montesano, and Carlo Verdone.', u"Rome's historic contribution to language in a worldwide sense is much more extensive however.", u'Through the process of Romanisation, the peoples of Gallia, the Iberian Peninsula, Italy and Dacia developed languages which derive directly from Latin and were adopted in large areas of the world both through colonisation and cultural influence.', u'Moreover, also modern English, because of the Norman Conquest, borrowed a large percentage of its vocabulary from the Latin language.', u'The Roman or Latin alphabet is the most widely used writing system in the world used by the greatest number of languages.', u'Rome has long hosted artistic communities, foreign resident communities and a large number of foreign religious students or pilgrims and so has always been a multilingual city.', u'Today because of mass tourism many languages are used in servicing tourism, especially English which is widely known in tourist areas, and the city hosts large numbers of immigrants and so has many multilingual immigrant areas.', u'== Sports ==\n\nThe Stadio Olimpico is mostly used as a shared home stadium for Serie A football clubs S.S. Lazio and A.S. Roma, who contest the Derby della Capitale.', u'Association football is the most popular sport in Rome, as in the rest of the country.', u'The city hosted the final games of the 1934 and 1990 FIFA World Cup.', u'The latter took place in the Olympic Stadium, which is also the home stadium for local Serie A clubs S.S. Lazio, founded in 1900, and A.S. Roma, founded in 1927, whose rivalry has become a staple of Roman sports culture.', u'Footballers who play for these teams and are also born in the city tend to become especially popular, as has been the case with players such as Francesco Totti and Daniele De Rossi (both for A.S. Roma), and Alessandro Nesta (for S.S. Lazio).', u'Atletico Roma is a minor team that played in First Division until 2012; its home stadium was Stadio Flaminio.', u'Rome hosted the 1960 Summer Olympics, with great success, using many ancient sites such as the Villa Borghese and the Thermae of Caracalla as venues.', u'For the Olympic Games many new structures were created, notably the new large Olympic Stadium (which was also enlarged and renewed to host qualification and the final match of the 1990 FIFA World Cup), the Villaggio Olimpico (Olympic Village, created to host the athletes and redeveloped after the games as a residential district), ecc.', u'Rome made a bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics but it was withdrawn before the deadline for applicant files.', u'Further, Rome hosted the 1991 EuroBasket and is home to the internationally recognized basketball team Virtus Roma.', u'Rugby union is gaining wider acceptance.', u'Until 2011 the Stadio Flaminio was the home stadium for the Italy national rugby union team, which has been playing in the Six Nations Championship since 2000.', u'The team now plays home games at the Stadio Olimpico because the Stadio Flaminio needs works of renovation in order to improve both its capacity and safety.', u'Rome is home to local rugby union teams such as Rugby Roma (founded in 1930 and winner of five Italian championships, the latter in 1999\u20132000), Unione Rugby Capitolina and S.S. Lazio 1927 (rugby union branch of the multisport club S.S. Lazio).', u'Every May, Rome hosts the ATP Masters Series tennis tournament on the clay courts of the Foro Italico.', u'Cycling was popular in the post-World War II period, although its popularity has faded.', u"Rome has hosted the final portion of the Giro d'Italia twice, in 1989 and 2000.", u'Rome is also home to other sports teams, including volleyball (M. Roma Volley), handball or waterpolo.', u'== Transport ==\n\nRome is at the centre of the radial network of roads that roughly follow the lines of the ancient Roman roads which began at the Capitoline Hill and connected Rome with its empire.', u'Today Rome is circled, at a distance of about 10 km (6 mi) from the Capitol, by the ring-road (the Grande Raccordo Anulare or GRA).', u'Due to its location in the centre of the Italian peninsula, Rome is the principal railway node for central Italy.', u"Rome's main railway station, Termini, is one of the largest railway stations in Europe and the most heavily used in Italy, with around 400 thousand travellers passing through every day.", u'The second-largest station in the city, Roma Tiburtina, has been redeveloped as a high-speed rail terminus.', u'Rome is served by three airports.', u"The intercontinental Leonardo da Vinci International Airport is Italy's chief airport, is located within the nearby Fiumicino, south-west of Rome.", u'The older Rome Ciampino Airport is a joint civilian and military airport.', u'It is commonly referred to as "Ciampino Airport", as it is located beside Ciampino, south-east of Rome.', u'A third airport, the Roma-Urbe Airport, is a small, low-traffic airport located about 6 km (4 mi) north of the city centre, which handles most helicopter and private flights.', u'Although the city has its own quarter on the Mediterranean Sea (Lido di Ostia), this has only a marina and a small channel-harbour for fisher boats.', u'The main harbour which serves Rome is Port of Civitavecchia, located about 62 kilometres (39 miles) northwest of the city.', u'The city suffers from traffic problems largely due to this radial street pattern, making it difficult for Romans to move easily from the vicinity of one of the radial roads to another without going into the historic centre or using the ring-road.', u"These problems are not helped by the limited size of Rome's metro system when compared to other cities of similar size.", u'In addition, Rome has only 21 taxis for every 10,000 inhabitants, far below other major European cities.', u'Chronic congestion caused by cars during the 1970s and 1980s led to restrictions being placed on vehicle access to the inner city-centre during the hours of daylight.', u'Areas where these restriction apply are known as Limited Traffic Zones (Zona a Traffico Limitato (ZTL) in Italian).', u'More recently, heavy night-time traffic in Trastevere, Testaccio and San Lorenzo has led to the creation of night-time ZTLs in those districts.', u'A 3-line metro system called the Metropolitana operates in Rome.', u'Construction on the first branch started in the 1930s.', u'The line had been planned to quickly connect the main railway station with the newly planned E42 area in the southern suburbs, where the 1942 World Fair was supposed to be held.', u'The event never took place because of war, but the area was later partly redesigned and renamed EUR (Esposizione Universale di Roma: Rome Universal Exhibition) in the 1950s to serve as a modern business district.', u'The line was finally opened in 1955, and it is now the south part of the B Line.', u'The A line opened in 1980 from Ottaviano to Anagnina stations, later extended in stages (1999\u20132000) to Battistini.', u'In the 1990s, an extension of the B line was opened from Termini to Rebibbia.', u'This underground network is generally reliable (although it may become very congested at peak times and during events, especially the A line) as it is relatively short.', u'The A and B lines intersect at Roma Termini station.', u'A new branch of the B line (B1) opened on 13 June 2012 after an estimated building cost of \u20ac500 million.', u'B1 connects to line B at Piazza Bologna and has four stations over a distance of 3.9 km (2 mi).', u'A third line, the C line, is under construction with an estimated cost of \u20ac3 billion and will have 30 stations over a distance of 25.5 km (16 mi).', u'It will partly replace the existing Termini-Pantano rail line.', u'It will feature full automated, driverless trains.', u'The first section with 15 stations connecting Pantano with the quarter of Centocelle in the eastern part of the city, opened on 9 November 2014.', u'The end of the work was scheduled in 2015, but archaeological findings often delay underground construction work.', u'A fourth line, D line, is also planned.', u'It will have 22 stations over a distance of 20 km (12 mi).', u"The first section was projected to open in 2015 and the final sections before 2035, but due to the city's financial crisis the project has been put on hold.", u'Above-ground public transport in Rome is made up of a bus, tram and urban train network (FR lines).', u'The bus, tram, metro and urban railways network is run by Atac S.p.A. (which originally stood for the Municipal Bus and Tramways Company, Azienda Tramvie e Autobus del Comune in Italian).', u'The bus network has in excess of 350 bus lines and over eight thousand bus stops, whereas the more-limited tram system has 39 km (24 mi) of track and 192 stops.', u'There is also one trolleybus line, opened in 2005, and additional trolleybus lines are planned.', u'== International entities, organisations and involvement ==\n\nAmong the global cities, Rome is unique in having a sovereign state located entirely within its city limits, the Vatican City.', u'The Vatican is an enclave of the Italian capital city and a sovereign possession of the Holy See which is the Diocese of Rome and the supreme government of the Roman Catholic Church.', u'Rome hosts foreign embassies to both Italy and the Holy See.', u'Several international Roman Colleges and Pontifical Universities are located in Rome.', u'The Pope is the Bishop of Rome and its official seat is the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran (of which the President of the French Republic is ex officio the "first and only honorary canon", a title held by the heads of the French state since King Henry IV of France).', u'Another body, the Sovereign Military Order of Malta (SMOM), took refuge in Rome in 1834, due to the conquest of Malta by Napoleon in 1798.', u'It is sometimes classified as having sovereignty but does not claim any territory in Rome or anywhere else, hence leading to dispute over its actual sovereign status.', u'Rome is the seat of the so-called Polo Romano made up by three main international agencies of the United Nations: the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).', u'Rome has traditionally been involved in the process of European political integration.', u'The Treaties of the EU are located in Palazzo della Farnesina, seat of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, due the fact that the Italian government is the depositary of the treaties.', u'In 1957 the city hosted the signing of the Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community (predecessor to the European Union), and also played host to the official signing of the proposed European Constitution in July 2004.', u'Rome is the seat of the European Olympic Committee and of the NATO Defense College.', u'The city is the place where the Statute of the International Criminal Court and the European Convention on Human Rights were formulated.', u'The city hosts also other important international entities such as the IDLO (International Development Law Organisation), the ICCROM (International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property) and the UNIDROIT (International Institute for the Unification of Private Law).', u'== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\n\nRome is since 9 April 1956 exclusively and reciprocally twinned only with:\n Paris, France\n(French) Seule Paris est digne de Rome; seule Rome est digne de Paris.', u'(Italian) Solo Parigi \xe8 degna di Roma; solo Roma \xe8 degna di Parigi.', u'"Only Paris is worthy of Rome; only Rome is worthy of Paris."', u'=== Other relationships ===\nRome\'s other partner cities are:\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nC40 Cities Climate Leadership Group\nList of museums in Rome\nList of shopping areas and markets in Rome\nList of tallest buildings in Rome\nList of theatres and opera houses in Rome\nOutline of Italy\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nDe Muro, P., Monni, S., Tridico, P.

definition of net taxable income for most sub-federal jurisdictions mostly follows the federal definition.', u'The rate of tax at the federal level is graduated; that is, the tax rates on higher amounts of income are higher than on lower amounts.', u'Some states and localities impose an income tax at a graduated rate, and some at a flat rate on all taxable income.', u'Federal tax rates in 2013 varied from 10% to 39.6%.', u'Individuals are eligible for a reduced rate of federal income tax on capital gains and qualifying dividends.', u'The tax rate and some deductions are different for individuals depending on filing status.', u'Married individuals may compute tax as a couple or separately.', u'Single individuals may be eligible for reduced tax rates if they are head of a household in which they live with a dependent.', u'Taxable income is defined in a comprehensive manner in the Internal Revenue Code and tax regulations issued by the Department of Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service.', u'Taxable income is gross income as adjusted minus deductions.', u'Most states and localities follow these definitions at least in part, though some make adjustments to determine income taxed in that jurisdiction.', u'Taxable income for a company or business may not be the same as its book income.', u'Gross income includes all income earned or received from whatever source.', u'This includes salaries and wages, tips, pensions, fees earned for services, price of goods sold, other business income, gains on sale of other property, rents received, interest and dividends received, alimony received, proceeds from selling crops, and many other types of income.', u'Some income, however, is exempt from income tax.', u'This includes interest on municipal bonds.', u'Adjustments (usually reductions) to gross income of individuals are made for alimony paid, contributions to many types of retirement or health savings plans, certain student loan interest, half of self-employment tax, and a few other items.', u'The cost of goods sold in a business is a direct reduction of gross income.', u'Business deductions: Taxable income of all taxpayers is reduced by deductions for expenses related to their business.', u'These include salaries, rent, and other business expenses paid or accrued, as well as allowances for depreciation.', u'The deduction of expenses may result in a loss.', u'Generally, such loss can reduce other taxable income, subject to some limits.', u'Personal deductions: Individuals are allowed several nonbusiness deductions.', u'A flat amount per person is allowed as a deduction for personal exemptions.', u'For 2015 this amount is $4,000.', u'Taxpayers are allowed one such deduction for themselves and one for each person they support.', u'Standard deduction: In addition, individuals get a deduction from taxable income for certain personal expenses.', u'Alternatively, the individual may claim a standard deduction.', u'For 2015, the standard deduction is $6,300 for single individuals, $12,600 for a married couple, and $9,250 for a head of household.', u'The standard deduction is higher for individuals over age 65 or who are blind.', u'Itemized deductions: Those who choose to claim actual itemized deductions may deduct the following, subject to many conditions and limitations:\nMedical expenses in excess of 10% of adjusted gross income,\nState, local, and foreign taxes,\nHome mortgage interest,\nContributions to charities,\nLosses on nonbusiness property due to casualty, and\nDeductions for expenses incurred in the production of income in excess of 2% of adjusted gross income.', u'Capital gains: and qualified dividends may be taxed as part of taxable income.', u'However, the tax is limited to a lower tax rate.', u'Capital gains include gains on selling stocks and bonds, real estate, and other capital assets.', u'The gain is the excess of the proceeds over the adjusted basis (cost less depreciation deductions allowed) of the property.', u'This limit on tax also applies to dividends from U.S. corporations and many foreign corporations.', u'There are limits on how much net capital loss may reduce other taxable income.', u'Tax credits: All taxpayers are allowed a credit for foreign taxes and for a percentage of certain types of business expenses.', u'Individuals are also allowed credits related to education expenses, retirement savings, child care expenses, some health care premiums, and a credit for each child.', u'Each of the credits is subject to specific rules and limitations.', u'Some credits are treated as refundable payments.', u'Alternative Minimum Tax: All taxpayers are also subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax if their income exceeds certain exclusion amounts.', u'This tax applies only if it exceeds regular income tax, and is reduced by some credits.', u'Tax returns: Most individuals must file income tax returns to self assess income tax in each year their income exceeds the standard deduction plus one personal exemption.', u'Some taxpayers must file an income tax return because they satisfy one of the following conditions:\nTaxpayer owes any special taxes such as the Alternative Minimum Tax\nTaxpayer received any HSA, Archer MSA, or Medicare Advantage MSA distributions\nTaxpayer had net earnings from self-employment of at least $400\nTaxpayer had wages of $108.28 or more from a church or qualified church-controlled organization that is exempt from employer social security and Medicare taxes\nOther taxpayers must file income tax returns each year to self assess income tax.', u'These returns may be filed electronically.', u"Generally, an individual's tax return covers the calendar year.", u'Corporations may elect a different tax year.', u'Most states and localities follow the federal tax year, and require separate returns.', u'Tax payment: Taxpayers must pay income tax due without waiting for an assessment.', u'Many taxpayers are subject to withholding taxes when they receive income.', u'To the extent withholding taxes do not cover all taxes due, all taxpayers must make estimated tax payments.', u'Tax penalties: Failing to make payments on time, or failing to file returns, can result in substantial penalties.', u'Certain intentional failures may result in jail time.', u'Tax returns may be examined and adjusted by tax authorities.', u'Taxpayers have rights to appeal any change to tax, and these rights vary by jurisdiction.', u'Taxpayers may also go to court to contest tax changes.', u'Tax authorities may not make changes after a certain period of time (generally three years).', u'== Federal income tax rates for individuals ==\n\nFederal income brackets and tax rates for individuals are adjusted annually for inflation.', u'The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) accounts for changes to the CPI and publishes the new rates as "Tax Rate Schedules".', u'=== Marginal tax rates ===\n\n\n==== Marginal tax rates since 2008 ====\n\n\n==== Marginal tax rates for 2016 ====\nBeginning in 2013, an additional tax of 3.8% applies to net investment income in excess of certain thresholds.', u"An individual pays tax at a given bracket only for each dollar within that tax bracket's range.", u'The top marginal rate does not apply in certain years to certain types of income.', u'Significantly lower rates apply after 2003 to capital gains and qualifying dividends (see below).', u'=== Example of a tax computation ===\nIncome tax for year 2016:\nSingle taxpayer, no children, under 65 and not blind, taking standard deduction;\n$40,000 gross income \u2013 $6,300 standard deduction \u2013 $4,050 personal exemption = $29,650 taxable income\n$9,275 \xd7 10% = $927.50 (taxation of the first income bracket)\n$29,650 \u2013 $9,275 = $20,375.00 (amount in the second income bracket)\n$20,375.00 \xd7 15% = $3,056.25 (taxation of the amount in the second income bracket)\n\nTotal income tax is $927.50 + $3,056.25 = $3,983.75 (~9.96% effective tax)\nNote, however, that taxpayers with taxable income of less than $100,000 must use IRS provided tax tables.', u'Under that table for 2015, the income tax in the above example would be $3,998.00.', u"In addition to income tax, a wage earner would also have to pay Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax (FICA) (and an equal amount of FICA tax must be paid by the employer):\n$40,000 (adjusted gross income)\n$40,000 \xd7 6.2% = $2,480 (Social Security portion)\n$40,000 \xd7 1.45% = $580 (Medicare portion)\n\nTotal FICA tax paid by employee = $3,060 (7.65% of income)\nTotal federal tax of individual = $3,983.75 + $3,060.00 = $7,043.75 (~17.63% of income)\nTotal federal tax including employer's contribution:\nTotal FICA tax contributed by employer = $3,060 (7.65% of income)\nTotal federal tax of individual including employer's contribution = $3,983.75 + $3,060.00 + $3,060.00 = $10,103.25 (~25.28% of income)\n\n\n=== Effective income tax rates ===\nEffective tax rates are typically lower than marginal rates due to various deductions, with some people actually having a negative liability.", u'The individual income tax rates in the following chart include capital gains taxes, which have different marginal rates than regular income.', u"Only the first $118,500 of someone's income is subject to social insurance (Social Security) taxes in 2016.", u'The table below also does not reflect changes, effectively with 2013 law, which increased the average tax paid by the top 1% to the highest levels since 1979, at an effective rate of 33% while most other taxpayers have remained at the near the lowest levels since 1979.', u'== Taxable income ==\nIncome tax is imposed as a tax rate times taxable income.', u'Taxable income is defined as gross income less allowable deductions.', u'Taxable income as determined for federal tax purposes may be modified for state tax purposes.', u'=== Gross income ===\n\nThe Internal Revenue Code states that "gross income means all income from whatever source derived," and gives specific examples.', u'Gross income is not limited to cash received.', u'"It includes income realized in any form, whether money, property, or services."', u'Gross income includes wages and tips, fees for performing services, gain from sale of inventory or other property, interest, dividends, rents, royalties, pensions, alimony, and many other types of income.', u'Items must be included in income when received or accrued.', u'The amount included is the amount the taxpayer is entitled to receive.', u'Gains on property are the gross proceeds less amounts returned, cost of goods sold, or tax basis of property sold.', u'Certain types of income are exempt from income tax.', u'Among the more common types of exempt income are interest on municipal bonds, a portion of Social Security benefits, life insurance proceeds, gifts or inheritances, and the value of many employee benefits.', u'Gross income is reduced by adjustments and deductions.', u'Among the more common adjustments are reductions for alimony paid and IRA and certain other retirement plan contributions.', u'Adjusted gross income is used in calculations relating to various deductions, credits, phase outs, and penalties.', u'=== Business deductions ===\n\nMost business deductions are allowed regardless of the form in which the business is conducted.', u'Thus, an individual small business owner is allowed most of the same business deductions as a publicly traded corporation.', u'A business is an activity conducted regularly with an intent to make a profit.', u'Only a few business related deductions are unique to a particular form of doing business.', u'The deduction of investment expenses by individuals, however, has several limitations, along with other itemized (personal) deductions.', u'The amount and timing of deductions for income tax purposes is determined under tax rules, not accounting rules.', u'See Accounting periods and methods, below.', u'Tax rules are based on principles similar in many ways to accounting rules, but there are significant differences.', u'Deductions for most meals and entertainment costs are limited to 50% of the costs, and costs of starting up a business (sometimes called pre-operating costs) are deductible ratably over 60 months.', u'Deductions for lobbying and political expenses are limited.', u'Some other limitations apply.', u'Expenses that are likely to produce future benefits must be capitalized.', u'The capitalized costs are then deductible as depreciation (see MACRS) or amortization over the period future benefits are expected.', u'Examples include costs of machinery and equipment and costs of making or building property.', u'IRS tables specify lives of assets by class of asset or industry in which used.', u'When an asset the cost of which was capitalized is sold, exchanged, or abandoned, the proceeds (if any) are reduced by the remaining unrecovered cost to determine gain or loss.', u'The gain or loss may be ordinary (as in the case of inventory) or capital (as in the case of stocks and bonds), or a combination (for some buildings and equipment).', u'Most personal, living, and family expenses are not deductible.', u'However, see Personal deductions, below.', u'Business deductions allowed for Federal income tax are almost always allowed in determining state income tax.', u'Only some states, though, allow itemized deductions for individuals.', u'Some states also limit deductions by corporations for investment related expenses.', u'Many states allow different amounts for depreciation deductions.', u'State limitations on deductions may differ significantly from Federal limitations.', u'Business deductions in excess of business income result in losses that may offset other income.', u'However, losses from passive activities may be deferred to the extent they exceed income from other passive activities.', u'Passive activities include most rental activities (except for real estate professionals) and business activities in which the taxpayer does not materially participate.', u"In addition, losses may not, in most cases, be deducted in excess of the taxpayer's amount at risk (generally tax basis in the entity plus share of debt).", u'=== Personal deductions ===\nIndividuals are allowed a special deduction called a personal exemption for dependents.', u'This is a fixed amount allowed each taxpayer, plus an additional fixed amount for each child or other dependents the taxpayer supports.', u'The amount of this deduction is $4,000 for 2015.', u'The amount is indexed annually for inflation.', u'The amount of exemption is phased out at higher incomes through 2009 and after 2012 (no phase out in 2010\u20132012).', u'Citizens and individuals who have U.S. tax residence may deduct a flat amount as a standard deduction.', u'Alternatively, they may claim an itemized deduction for actual amounts incurred for specific categories of nonbusiness expenses.', u'Expenses incurred to produce tax exempt income and several other items are not deductible.', u'Home owners may deduct the amount of interest and property taxes paid on their principal and second homes.', u'Local and state income taxes are deductible, or the individual may elect to deduct state and local sales tax.', u'Contributions to charitable organizations are deductible by individuals and corporations, but the deduction is limited to 50% and 10% of gross income respectively.', u'Medical expenses in excess of 10% of adjusted gross income are deductible, as are uninsured casualty losses.', u'Other income producing expenses in excess of 2% of adjusted gross income are also deductible.', u'For years before 2010, the allowance of itemized deductions was phased out at higher incomes.', u'The phase out expired for 2010.', u'== Capital gains ==\n\nTaxable income includes capital gains.', u'However, individuals are taxed at a lower rate on long term capital gains and qualifying dividends (see below).', u'A capital gain is the excess of the sales price over the tax basis (usually, the cost) of capital assets, generally those assets not held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business.', u'Capital losses (where basis is more than sales price) are deductible, but deduction for long term capital losses is limited to the total capital gains for the year, plus for individuals up to $3,000 of ordinary income ($1,500 if married filing separately).', u"An individual may exclude $250,000 ($500,000 for a married couple filing jointly) of capital gains on the sale of the individual's primary residence, subject to certain conditions and limitations.", u'Gains on depreciable property used in a business are treated as ordinary income to the extent of depreciation previously claimed.', u'In determining gain, it is necessary to determine which property is sold and the amount of basis of that property.', u'This may require identification conventions, such as first-in-first-out, for identical properties like shares of stock.', u'Further, tax basis must be allocated among properties purchased together unless they are sold together.', u'Original basis, usually cost paid for the asset, is reduced by deductions for depreciation or loss.', u'Certain capital gains are deferred; that is, they are taxed at a time later than the year of disposition.', u'Gains on property sold for installment payments may be recognized as those payments are received.', u'Gains on property exchanged for like kind property are not recognized, and the tax basis of the new property is based on the tax basis of the old property.', u'Before 1986 and from 2004 onward, individuals have been subject to a reduced rate of federal tax on capital gains (called long-term capital gains) on certain property held more than 12 months.', u'This reduced rate (15% or 20%, depending on regular tax bracket) applies for regular tax and the Alternative Minimum Tax.', u'The reduced rate also applies to dividends from corporations organized in the United States or a country with which the United States has an income tax treaty.', u'* Capital gains up to $250,000 ($500,000 if filed jointly) on real estate used as primary residence are exempt.', u'After 2012, an additional tax bracket of 39.6% applies to ordinary income.', u'The tax rate on long-term capital gains and dividends beginning 2013 for those in the 39.6% bracket is 20% plus a 3.8% surcharge for high-income filers.', u'== Partnerships and LLCs ==\nBusiness entities treated as partnerships are not subject to income tax at the entity level.', u'Instead, their members include their shares of income, deductions, and credits in computing their own tax.', u"The character of the partner's share of income (such as capital gains) is determined at the partnership level.", u'Many types of business entities, including limited liability companies (LLCs), may elect to be treated as a corporation or as a partnership.', u'Distributions from partnerships are not taxed as dividends.', u'== Corporate tax ==\n\nCorporate tax is imposed in the United States at the federal, most state, and some local levels on the income of entities treated for tax purposes as corporations.', u'Shareholders of a corporation wholly owned by U.S. citizens and resident individuals may elect for the corporation to be taxed similarly to partnerships (see S Corporation).', u'Corporate income tax is based on taxable income, which is defined similarly to individual taxable income.', u'Shareholders (including other corporations) of corporations (other than S Corporations) are taxed on dividend distributions from the corporation.', u'They are also subject to tax on capital gains upon sale or exchange of their shares for money or property.', u'However, certain exchanges, such as in reorganizations, are not taxable.', u'Multiple corporations may file a consolidated return at the federal and some state levels with their common parent.', u'=== Corporate tax rates ===\nFederal corporate income tax is imposed at graduated rates from 15% to 35%.', u'The lower rate brackets are phased out at higher rates of income, with all income subject to tax at 34% to 35% where taxable income exceeds $335,000.', u'Additional tax rates imposed at the state and local level vary widely by jurisdiction, from under 1% to over 16%.', u'State and local income taxes are allowed as tax deductions in computing federal taxable income.', u'=== Deductions for corporations ===\nCorporations are not allowed the personal deductions allowed to individuals, such as deductions for exemptions and the standard deduction.', u'However, most other deductions are allowed.', u'In addition, corporations are allowed certain deductions unique to corporate status.', u'These include a partial deduction for dividends received from other corporations, deductions related to organization costs, and certain other items.', u'Some deductions of corporations are limited at federal or state levels.', u'Limitations apply to items due to related parties, including interest and royalty expenses.', u'== Estates and trusts ==\nEstates and trusts may be subject to income tax at the estate or trust level, or the beneficiaries may be subject to income tax on their share of income.', u'Where the all income must be distributed, the beneficiaries are taxed similarly to partners in a partnership.', u'Where income may be retained, the estate or trust is taxed.', u'It may get a deduction for later distributions of income.', u'Estates and trusts are allowed only those deductions related to producing income, plus $1,000.', u'They are taxed at graduated rates that increase rapidly to the maximum rate for individuals.', u'The tax rate for trust and estate income in excess of $11,500 was 35% for 2009.', u'Estates and trusts are eligible for the reduced rate of tax on dividends and capital gains through 2011.', u'== Retirement savings and fringe benefit plans ==\nEmployers get a deduction for amounts contributed to a qualified employee retirement plan or benefit plan.', u'The employee does not recognize income with respect to the plan until he or she receives a distribution from the plan.', u'The plan itself is organized as a trust and is considered a separate entity.', u'For the plan to qualify for tax exemption, and for the employer to get a deduction, the plan must meet minimum participation, vesting, funding, and operational standards.', u'Examples of qualified plans include:\nPension plans (defined benefit pension plan),\nProfit sharing plans (defined contribution plan),\nEmployee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOPs),\nStock purchase plans,\nHealth insurance plans,\nEmployee benefit plans,\nCafeteria plans.', u'Employees or former employees are generally taxed on distributions from retirement or stock plans.', u'Employees are not taxed on distributions from health insurance plans to pay for medical expenses.', u'Cafeteria plans allow employees to choose among benefits (like choosing food in a cafeteria), and distributions to pay those expenses are not taxable.', u'In addition, individuals may make contributions to Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs).', u'Those not currently covered by other retirement plans may claim a deduction for contributions to certain types of IRAs.', u'Income earned within an IRA is not taxed until the individual withdraws it.', u'== Credits ==\n\nThe federal and state systems offer numerous tax credits for individuals and businesses.', u'Among the key federal credits for individuals are:\nChild credit: a credit up to $1,000 per qualifying child.', u'Child and dependent care credit: a credit up to $6,000, phased out at incomes above $15,000.', u'Earned Income Tax Credit: this refundable credit is granted for a percentage of income earned by a low income individual.', u'The credit is calculated and capped based on the number of qualifying children, if any.', u'This credit is indexed for inflation and phased out for incomes above a certain amount.', u'For 2015, the maximum credit was $6,422.', u'Credit for the elderly and disabled: A nonrefundable credit up to $1,125\nTwo mutually exclusive credits for college expenses.', u'Businesses are also eligible for several credits.', u'These credits are available to individuals and corporations, and can be taken by partners in business partnerships.', u'Among the federal credits included in a "general business credit" are:\nCredit for increasing research expenses.', u'Work Incentive Credit or credit for hiring people in certain enterprise zones or on welfare.', u'A variety of industry specific credits.', u'In addition, a federal foreign tax credit is allowed for foreign income taxes paid.', u'This credit is limited to the portion of federal income tax arising due to foreign source income.', u'The credit is available to all taxpayers.', u'Business credits and the foreign tax credit may be offset taxes in other years.', u'States and some localities offer a variety of credits that vary by jurisdiction.', u'States typically grant a credit to resident individuals for income taxes paid to other states, generally limited in proportion to income taxed in the other state(s).', u'== Alternative minimum tax ==\n\nTaxpayers must pay the higher of the regular income tax or the alternative minimum tax (AMT).', u'Taxpayers who have paid AMT in prior years may claim a credit against regular tax for the prior AMT.', u'The credit is limited so that regular tax is not reduced below current year AMT.', u'AMT is imposed at a nearly flat rate (20% for corporations, 26% or 28% for individuals, estates, and trusts) on taxable income as modified for AMT.', u'Key differences between regular taxable income and AMT taxable income include:\nThe standard deduction and personal exemptions are replaced by a single deduction, which is phased out at higher income levels,\nNo deduction is allowed individuals for state taxes,\nMost miscellaneous itemized deductions are not allowed for individuals,\nDepreciation deductions are computed differently, and\nCorporations must make a complex adjustment to more closely reflect economic income.', u'== Accounting periods and methods ==\nThe United States tax system allows individuals and entities to choose their tax year.', u'Most individuals choose the calendar year.', u'There are restrictions on choice of tax year for some closely held entities.', u'Taxpayers may change their tax year in certain circumstances, and such change may require IRS approval.', u'Taxpayers must determine their taxable income based on their method of accounting for the particular activity.', u'Most individuals use the cash method for all activities.', u'Under this method, income is recognized when received and deductions taken when paid.', u'Taxpayers may choose or be required to use the accrual method for some activities.', u'Under this method, income is recognized when the right to receive it arises, and deductions are taken when the liability to pay arises and the amount can be reasonably determined.', u'Taxpayers recognizing cost of goods sold on inventory must use the accrual method with respect to sales and costs of the inventory.', u'Methods of accounting may differ for financial reporting and tax purposes.', u'Specific methods are specified for certain types of income or expenses.', u'Gain on sale of property other than inventory may be recognized at the time of sale or over the period in which installment sale payments are received.', u'Income from long term contracts must be recognized ratably over the term of the contract, not just at completion.', u'Other special rules also apply.', u'== Tax exempt entities ==\n\nU.S. tax law exempts certain types of entities from income and some other taxes.', u'These provisions arose during the late 19th century.', u'Charitable organizations and cooperatives may apply to the IRS for tax exemption.', u'Exempt organizations are still taxed on any business income.', u'An organization which participates in lobbying, political campaigning, or certain other activities may lose its exempt status.', u'Special taxes apply to prohibited transactions and activities of tax-exempt entities.', u'== Special taxes ==\nThere are many federal tax rules designed to prevent people from abusing the tax system.', u'Provisions related to these taxes are often complex.', u'Such rules include:\nAccumulated earnings tax on corporation accumulations in excess of business needs,\nPersonal holding company taxes,\nPassive foreign investment company rules, and\nControlled foreign corporation provisions.', u'== Special industries ==\nTax rules recognize that some types of businesses do not earn income in the traditional manner and thus require special provisions.', u'For example, insurance companies must ultimately pay claims to some policy holders from the amounts received as premiums.', u'These claims may happen years after the premium payment.', u'Computing the future amount of claims requires actuarial estimates until claims are actually paid.', u"Thus, recognizing premium income as received and claims expenses as paid would seriously distort an insurance company's income.", u'Special rules apply to some or all items in the following industries:\nInsurance companies (rules related to recognition of income and expense; different rules apply to life insurance and to property and casualty insurance)\nShipping (rules related to the revenue recognition cycle)\nExtractive industries (rules related to expenses for exploration and development and for recovery of capitalized costs)\nIn addition, mutual funds (regulated investment companies) are subject to special rules allowing them to be taxed only at the owner level.', u'The company must report to each owner his/her share of ordinary income, capital gains, and creditable foreign taxes.', u'The owners then include these items in their own tax calculation.', u'The fund itself is not taxed, and distributions are treated as a return of capital to the owners.', u'Similar rules apply to real estate investment trusts and real estate mortgage investment conduits.', u'== International aspects ==\n\nThe United States imposes tax on all citizens of the United States, including those who are residents of other countries, and U.S. corporations.', u'Federal income tax is imposed on citizens, residents, and U.S. corporations based on their worldwide income.', u'To mitigate double taxation, a credit is allowed for foreign income taxes.', u'This foreign tax credit is limited to that part of current year tax caused by foreign source income.', u'Determining such part involves determining the source of income and allocating and apportioning deductions to that income.', u'States tax resident individuals and corporations on their worldwide income, but few allow a credit for foreign taxes.', u'In addition, Federal income tax may be imposed on non-resident non-citizens, including corporations, on U.S. source income.', u'Federal tax applies to interest, dividends, royalties, and certain other income of nonresident aliens and foreign corporations at a flat rate of 30%.', u'This rate is often reduced under tax treaties.', u'Foreign persons are taxed on income from a U.S. business and gains on U.S. realty similarly to U.S. persons.', u'Nonresident aliens who are present in the United States for a period of 183 days in a given year are subject to U.S. capital gains tax on certain net capital gains realized during that year from sources within the United States.', u'The states tax non-resident individuals only on income earned within the state (wages, etc.', u'), and tax individuals and corporations on business income apportioned to the state.', u'The United States has income tax treaties with over 65 countries.', u'These treaties reduce the chance of double taxation by allowing each country to fully tax its citizens and residents and reducing the amount the other country can tax them.', u'Generally the treaties provide for reduced rates of tax on investment income and limits as to which business income can be taxed.', u'The treaties each define which taxpayers can benefit from the treaty.', u'== Social Insurance taxes ==\n\nThe United States social insurance system is funded by a tax similar to an income tax.', u'Social Security tax of 6.2% is imposed on wages paid to employees.', u'The tax is imposed on both the employer and the employee.', u'For 2011 and 2012, the employee tax has been reduced from 6.2% to 4.2%.', u'The maximum amount of wages subject to the tax for 2009, 2010, and 2011 was/is $106,800.', u'This amount is indexed for inflation.', u'A companion Medicare Tax of 1.45% of wages is imposed on employers and employees, with no limitation.', u'A self-employment tax in like amounts (totaling 15.3%, 13.3% for 2011 and 2012) is imposed on self-employed persons.', u'== Withholding of tax ==\n\nPersons paying wages or making certain payments to foreign persons are required to withhold income tax from such payments.', u'Income tax withholding on wages is based on declarations by employees and tables provided by the IRS.', u'Persons paying interest, dividends, royalties, and certain other amounts to foreign persons must also withhold income tax at a flat rate of 30%.', u'This rate may be reduced by a tax treaty.', u'These withholding requirements also apply to non-U.S. financial institutions.', u'Additional backup withholding provisions apply to some payments of interest or dividends to U.S. persons.', u'The amount of income tax withheld is treated as a payment of tax by the person receiving the payment on which tax was withheld.', u'Employers and employees must also pay Social Security tax, the employee portion of which is also be withheld from wages.', u'Withholding of income and Social Security taxes are often referred to as payroll tax.', u'== Tax returns ==\nIndividuals (with income above a minimum level), corporations, partnerships, estates, and trusts must file annual reports, called tax returns, with federal and appropriate state tax authorities.', u'These returns vary greatly in complexity level depending on the type of filer and complexity of their affairs.', u'On the return, the taxpayer reports income and deductions, calculates the amount of tax owed, reports payments and credits, and calculates the balance due.', u'Federal individual, estate, and trust income tax returns are due by April 15 for most taxpayers.', u"Corporate and partnership Federal returns are due two and one half months following the corporation's year end.", u"Tax exempt entity returns are due four and one half months following the entity's year end.", u'All federal returns may be extended, with most extensions available upon merely filing a single page form.', u'Due dates and extension provisions for state and local income tax returns vary.', u'Income tax returns generally consist of the basic form with attached forms and schedules.', u"Several forms are available for individuals and corporations, depending on complexity and nature of the taxpayer's affairs.", u'Many individuals are able to use the one page Form 1040-EZ, which requires no attachments except wage statements from employers (Forms W-2).', u'Individuals claiming itemized deductions must complete Schedule A.', u'Similar schedules apply for interest (B), dividends (B), business income (C), capital gains (D), farm income (F), and self-employment tax (SE).', u'All taxpayers must file those forms for credits, depreciation, AMT, and other items that apply to them.', u'Electronic filing of tax returns may be done for taxpayers by registered tax preparers.', u'If a taxpayer discovers an error on a return, or determines that tax for a year should be different, the taxpayer should file an amended return.', u'These returns constitute claims for refund if taxes are determined to have been overpaid.', u'== Tax examinations ==\n\nThe IRS, state, and local tax authorities may examine a tax return and propose changes.', u'Changes to tax returns may be made with minimal advance involvement by taxpayers, such as changes to wage or dividend income to correct errors.', u'Other examination of returns may require extensive taxpayer involvement, such as an audit by the IRS.', u'These audits often require that taxpayers provide the IRS or other tax authority access to records of income and deductions.', u'Audits of businesses are usually conducted by IRS personnel at the business location.', u'Changes to returns are subject to appeal by the taxpayer, including going to court.', u'IRS changes are often first issued as proposed adjustments.', u'The taxpayer may agree to the proposal, or may advise the IRS why it disagrees.', u'Proposed adjustments are often resolved by the IRS and taxpayer agreeing to what the adjustment should be.', u'For those adjustments to which agreement is not reached, the IRS issues a 30-day letter advising of the adjustment.', u'The taxpayer may appeal this preliminary assessment within 30 days within the IRS.', u'The Appeals Division reviews the IRS field team determination and taxpayer arguments, and often proposes a solution that the IRS team and the taxpayer find acceptable.', u'Where agreement is still not reached, the IRS issues an assessment as a notice of deficiency or 90-day letter.', u'The taxpayer then has three choices: file suit in United States Tax Court without paying the tax, pay the tax and sue for refund in regular court, or pay the tax and be done.', u'Recourse to court can be costly and time consuming, but is often successful.', u'IRS computers routinely make adjustments to correct mechanical errors in returns.', u'In addition, the IRS conducts an extensive document matching computer program that compares taxpayer amounts of wages, interest, dividends, and other items to amounts reported by taxpayers.', u'These programs automatically issue 30-day letters advising of proposed changes.', u'Only a very small percentage of tax returns are actually examined.', u'These are selected by a combination of computer analysis of return information and random sampling.', u'The IRS has long maintained a program to identify patterns on returns most likely to require adjustment.', u'Procedures for examination by state and local authorities vary by jurisdiction.', u'=== Tax collection ===\nTaxpayers are required to pay all taxes owed based on the self-assessed tax returns, as adjusted.', u'The IRS collection process allows taxpayers to in certain circumstances, and provides time payment plans that include interest and a "penalty" that is merely added interest.', u'Where taxpayers do not pay tax owed, the IRS has strong means to enforce collection.', u'These include the ability to levy bank accounts and seize property.', u'Generally, significant advance notice is given before levy or seizure.', u'However, in certain rarely used jeopardy assessments the IRS may immediately seize money and property.', u'The IRS Collection Divisions are responsible for most collection activities.', u'== Statute of limitations ==\nThe IRS is precluded from assessing additional tax after a certain period of time.', u'In the case of federal income tax, this period is generally three years from the later of the due date of the original tax return or the date the original return was filed.', u'The IRS has an additional three more years to make changes if the taxpayer has substantially understated gross income.', u'The period under which the IRS may make changes is unlimited in the case of fraud, or in the case of failure to file a return.', u'== Penalties ==\n\nTaxpayers who fail to file returns, file late, or file returns that are wrong, may be subject to penalties.', u'These penalties vary based on the type of failure.', u'Some penalties are computed like interest, some are fixed amounts, and some are based on other measures.', u'Penalties for filing or paying late are generally based on the amount of tax that should have been paid and the degree of lateness.', u'Penalties for failures related to certain forms are fixed amounts, and vary by form from very small to huge.', u'Intentional failures, including tax fraud, may result in criminal penalties.', u'These penalties may include jail time or forfeiture of property.', u'Criminal penalties are assessed in coordination with the United States Department of Justice.', u'== History ==\n\n\n=== Constitutional ===\n\nArticle I, Section 8, Clause 1 of the United States Constitution (the "Taxing and Spending Clause"), specifies Congress\'s power to impose "Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises", but Article I, Section 8 requires that, "Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States."', u'The Constitution specifically stated Congress\' method of imposing direct taxes, by requiring Congress to distribute direct taxes in proportion to each state\'s population "determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons".', u'It has been argued that head taxes and property taxes (slaves could be taxed as either or both) were likely to be abused, and that they bore no relation to the activities in which the federal government had a legitimate interest.', u'The fourth clause of section 9 therefore specifies that, "No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken."', u'Taxation was also the subject of Federalist No.', u'33 penned secretly by the Federalist Alexander Hamilton under the pseudonym Publius.', u'In it, he asserts that the wording of the "Necessary and Proper" clause should serve as guidelines for the legislation of laws regarding taxation.', u'The legislative branch is to be the judge, but any abuse of those powers of judging can be overturned by the people, whether as states or as a larger group.', u'The courts have generally held that direct taxes are limited to taxes on people (variously called "capitation", "poll tax" or "head tax") and property.', u'All other taxes are commonly referred to as "indirect taxes," because they tax an event, rather than a person or property per se.', u'What seemed to be a straightforward limitation on the power of the legislature based on the subject of the tax proved inexact and unclear when applied to an income tax, which can be arguably viewed either as a direct or an indirect tax.', u'=== Early federal income taxes ===\nThe first income tax suggested in the United States was during the War of 1812.', u'The idea for the tax was based on the British Tax Act of 1798.', u'The British tax law applied progressive rates to income.', u'The British tax rates ranged from 0.833% on income starting at \xa360 to 10% on income above \xa3200.', u'The tax proposal was developed in 1814.', u'Because the treaty of Ghent was signed in 1815, ending hostilities and the need for additional revenue, the tax was never imposed in the United States.', u'In order to help pay for its war effort in the American Civil War, Congress imposed its first personal income tax in 1861.', u'It was part of the Revenue Act of 1861 (3% of all incomes over US $800).', u'This tax was repealed and replaced by another income tax in 1862.', u'In 1894, Democrats in Congress passed the Wilson-Gorman tariff, which imposed the first peacetime income tax.', u'The rate was 2% on income over $4000, which meant fewer than 10% of households would pay any.', u'The purpose of the income tax was to make up for revenue that would be lost by tariff reductions.', u"In 1895 the United States Supreme Court, in its ruling in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., held a tax based on receipts from the use of property to be unconstitutional.", u'The Court held that taxes on rents from real estate, on interest income from personal property and other income from personal property (which includes dividend income) were treated as direct taxes on property, and therefore had to be apportioned (divided among the states based on their populations).', u'Since apportionment of income taxes is impractical, this had the effect of prohibiting a federal tax on income from property.', u'However, the Court affirmed that the Constitution did not deny Congress the power to impose a tax on real and personal property, and it affirmed that such would be a direct tax.', u'Due to the political difficulties of taxing individual wages without taxing income from property, a federal income tax was impractical from the time of the Pollock decision until the time of ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment (below).', u'=== Ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment ===\n\nIn response, Congress proposed the Sixteenth Amendment (ratified by the requisite number of states in 1913), which states:\n\nThe Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.', u"The Supreme Court in Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad, 240 U.S. 1 (1916), indicated that the amendment did not expand the federal government's existing power to tax income (meaning profit or gain from any source) but rather removed the possibility of classifying an income tax as a direct tax on the basis of the source of the income.", u'The Amendment removed the need for the income tax to be apportioned among the states on the basis of population.', u'Income taxes are required, however, to abide by the law of geographical uniformity.', u'Some tax protesters and others opposed to income taxes cite what they contend is evidence that the Sixteenth Amendment was never properly ratified, based in large part on materials sold by William J. Benson.', u'In December 2007, Benson\'s "Defense Reliance Package" containing his non-ratification argument which he offered for sale on the Internet, was ruled by a federal court to be a "fraud perpetrated by Benson" that had "caused needless confusion and a waste of the customers\' and the IRS\' time and resources".', u'The court stated: "Benson has failed to point to evidence that would create a genuinely disputed fact regarding whether the Sixteenth Amendment was properly ratified or whether United States Citizens are legally obligated to pay federal taxes."', u'See also Tax protester Sixteenth Amendment arguments.', u'=== Modern interpretation of the power to tax incomes ===\nThe modern interpretation of the Sixteenth Amendment taxation power can be found in Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co. 348 U.S. 426 (1955).', u'In that case, a taxpayer had received an award of punitive damages from a competitor for antitrust violations and sought to avoid paying taxes on that award.', u'The Court observed that Congress, in imposing the income tax, had defined gross income, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, to include:\n\ngains, profits, and income derived from salaries, wages or compensation for personal service ... of whatever kind and in whatever form paid, or from professions, vocations, trades, businesses, commerce, or sales, or dealings in property, whether real or personal, growing out of the ownership or use of or interest in such property; also from interest, rent, dividends, securities, or the transaction of any business carried on for gain or profit, or gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever.', u'(Note: The Glenshaw Glass case was an interpretation of the definition of "gross income" in section 22 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.', u'The successor to section 22 of the 1939 Code is section 61 of the current Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.)', u'The Court held that "this language was used by Congress to exert in this field the full measure of its taxing power", id., and that "the Court has given a liberal construction to this broad phraseology in recognition of the intention of Congress to tax all gains except those specifically exempted."', u'The Court then enunciated what is now understood by Congress and the Courts to be the definition of taxable income, "instances of undeniable accessions to wealth, clearly realized, and over which the taxpayers have complete dominion."', u'Id.', u'at 431.', u'The defendant in that case suggested that a 1954 rewording of the tax code had limited the income that could be taxed, a position which the Court rejected, stating:\n\nThe definition of gross income has been simplified, but no effect upon its present broad scope was intended.', u'Certainly punitive damages cannot reasonably be classified as gifts, nor do they come under any other exemption provision in the Code.', u'We would do violence to the plain meaning of the statute and restrict a clear legislative attempt to bring the taxing power to bear upon all receipts constitutionally taxable were we to say that the payments in question here are not gross income.', u'Tax statutes passed after the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913 are sometimes referred to as the "modern" tax statutes.', u'Hundreds of Congressional acts have been passed since 1913, as well as several codifications (i.e., topical reorganizations) of the statutes (see Codification).', u'In Central Illinois Public Service Co. v. United States, 435 U.S. 21 (1978), the U.S. Supreme Court confirmed that wages and income are not identical as far as taxes on income are concerned, because income not only includes wages, but any other gains as well.', u'The Court in that case noted that in enacting taxation legislation, Congress "chose not to return to the inclusive language of the Tariff Act of 1913, but, specifically, \'in the interest of simplicity and ease of administration,\' confined the obligation to withhold [income taxes] to \'salaries, wages, and other forms of compensation for personal services\'" and that "committee reports ... stated consistently that \'wages\' meant remuneration \'if paid for services performed by an employee for his employer\'".', u'Other courts have noted this distinction in upholding the taxation not only of wages, but also of personal gain derived from other sources, recognizing some limitation to the reach of income taxation.', u'For example, in Conner v. United States, 303 F. Supp.', u'1187 (S.D.', u'Tex.', u"1969), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 439 F.2d 974 (5th Cir.", u'1971), a couple had lost their home to a fire, and had received compensation for their loss from the insurance company, partly in the form of hotel costs reimbursed.', u'The court acknowledged the authority of the IRS to assess taxes on all forms of payment, but did not permit taxation on the compensation provided by the insurance company, because unlike a wage or a sale of goods at a profit, this was not a gain.', u'As the Court noted, "Congress has taxed income, not compensation".', u'By contrast, other courts have interpreted the Constitution as providing even broader taxation powers for Congress.', u'In Murphy v. IRS, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the federal income tax imposed on a monetary settlement recovery that the same court had previously indicated was not income, stating: "[a]lthough the \'Congress cannot make a thing income which is not so in fact,\'... it can label a thing income and tax it, so long as it acts within its constitutional authority, which includes not only the Sixteenth Amendment but also Article I, Sections 8 and 9."', u'Similarly, in Penn Mutual Indemnity Co. v. Commissioner, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit indicated that Congress could properly impose the federal income tax on a receipt of money, regardless of what that receipt of money is called:\n\nIt could well be argued that the tax involved here [an income tax] is an "excise tax" based upon the receipt of money by the taxpayer.', u'It certainly is not a tax on property and it certainly is not a capitation tax; therefore, it need not be apportioned.', u'... Congress has the power to impose taxes generally, and if the particular imposition does not run afoul of any constitutional restrictions then the tax is lawful, call it what you will.', u'=== Income tax rates in history ===\n\n\n==== History of top rates ====\n\nIn 1913, the top tax rate was 7% on incomes above $500,000 (equivalent to $12 million in 2015 dollars) and a total of $28.3 million was collected.', u'During World War I, the top rate rose to 77% and the income threshold to be in this top bracket increased to $1,000,000 (equivalent to $18.5 million in 2015 dollars).', u'Under Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, top tax rates were reduced in 1921, 1924, 1926, and 1928.', u'Mellon argued that lower rates would spur economic growth.', u'By 1928, the top rate was scaled down to 24% along with the income threshold for paying this rate lowered to $100,000 (equivalent to $1.38 million in 2015 dollars).', u'During the Great Depression and World War II, the top income tax rate rose from pre-war levels.', u'In 1939, the top rate was 75% applied to incomes above $5,000,000 (equivalent to $85.2 million in 2015 dollars).', u'During 1944 and 1945, the top rate was its all-time high at 94% applied to income above $200,000 (equivalent to $2.69 million in 2015 dollars).', u'The highest marginal tax rate for individuals for U.S. federal income tax purposes for tax years 1952 and 1953 was 92%.', u'From 1964-2013, the threshold for paying top income tax rate has generally been between $200,000 and $400,000 (unadjusted for inflation).', u'The one exception is the period from 1982 to 1992 when the topmost income tax brackets were removed.', u'From 1981 until 1986 the top marginal rate was lowered to 50% on $86,000 and up (equivalent to $224 thousand in 2015 dollars).', u'From 1988 to 1990, the threshold for paying the top rate was even lower, with incomes above $29,750 (equivalent to $59.6 thousand in 2015 dollars) paying the top rate of 28% in those years.', u'Top tax rates were increased in 1992 and 1994, culminating in a 39.6% top individual rate applicable to all classes of income.', u'Top individual tax rates were lowered in 2004 to 35% and tax rates on dividends and capital gains lowered to 15%, with the Bush administration claiming lower rates would spur economic growth.', u"Based on the summary of federal tax income data in 2009, with a tax rate of 35%, the highest earning 1% of people paid 36.7% of the United States' income tax revenue.", u'In 2012, President Obama announced plans to raise the two top tax rates from 35% to 39.6% and from 33% to 36%.', u'==== Federal income tax rates ====\nFederal and state income tax rates have varied widely since 1913.', u'For example, in 1954, the federal income tax was based on layers of 24 income brackets at tax rates ranging from 20% to 91% (for a chart, see Internal Revenue Code of 1954).', u'Below is a table of historical marginal income tax rates for married filing jointly tax payers at stated income levels.', u'These income numbers are not the amounts used in the tax laws at the time.', u'== Sources of U.S. income tax laws ==\nUnited States income tax law comes from a number of sources.', u'These sources have been divided by one author into three tiers as follows:\nTier 1\nUnited States Constitution\nInternal Revenue Code (IRC) (legislative authority, written by the United States Congress through legislation)\nTreasury regulations\nFederal court opinions (judicial authority, written by courts as interpretation of legislation)\nTreaties (executive authority, written in conjunction with other countries)\n\nTier 2\nAgency interpretative regulations (executive authority, written by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Department of the Treasury), including:\nFinal, Temporary and Proposed Regulations promulgated under IRC \xa7 7805;\nTreasury Notices and Announcements;\n\nPublic Administrative Rulings (IRS Revenue Rulings, which provide informal guidance on specific questions and are binding on all taxpayers)\n\nTier 3\nLegislative History\nPrivate Administrative Rulings (private parties may approach the IRS directly and ask for a Private Letter Ruling on a specific issue \u2013 these rulings are binding only on the requesting taxpayer).', u'Where conflicts exist between various sources of tax authority, an authority in Tier 1 outweighs an authority in Tier 2 or 3.', u'Similarly, an authority in Tier 2 outweighs an authority in Tier 3.', u'Where conflicts exist between two authorities in the same tier, the "last-in-time rule" is applied.', u'As the name implies, the "last-in-time rule" states that the authority that was issued later in time is controlling.', u'Regulations and case law serve to interpret the statutes.', u'Additionally, various sources of law attempt to do the same thing.', u'Revenue Rulings, for example, serves as an interpretation of how the statutes apply to a very specific set of facts.', u'Treaties serve in an international realm.', u'== The complexity of the U.S. income tax laws ==\nUnited States tax law attempts to define a comprehensive system of measuring income in a complex economy.', u'Many provisions defining income or granting or removing benefits require significant definition of terms.', u'Further, many state income tax laws do not conform with federal tax law in material respects.', u'These factors and others have resulted in substantial complexity.', u'Even venerable legal scholars like Judge Learned Hand have expressed amazement and frustration with the complexity of the U.S. income tax laws.', u'In the article, Thomas Walter Swan, 57 Yale Law Journal No.', u'2, 167, 169 (December 1947), Judge Hand wrote:\n\nIn my own case the words of such an act as the Income Tax ... merely dance before my eyes in a meaningless procession: cross-reference to cross-reference, exception upon exception\u2014couched in abstract terms that offer [me] no handle to seize hold of [and that] leave in my mind only a confused sense of some vitally important, but successfully concealed, purport, which it is my duty to extract, but which is within my power, if at all, only after the most inordinate expenditure of time.', u'I know that these monsters are the result of fabulous industry and ingenuity, plugging up this hole and casting out that net, against all possible evasion; yet at times I cannot help recalling a saying of William James about certain passages of Hegel: that they were no doubt written with a passion of rationality; but that one cannot help wondering whether to the reader they have any significance save that the words are strung together with syntactical correctness.', u'Complexity is a separate issue from flatness of rate structures.', u'Also, in the United States, income tax laws are often used by legislatures as policy instruments for encouraging numerous undertakings deemed socially useful \u2014 including the buying of life insurance, the funding of employee health care and pensions, the raising of children, home ownership, development of alternative energy sources and increased investment in conventional energy.', u"Special tax provisions granted for any purpose increase complexity, irrespective of the system's flatness or lack thereof.", u'== State, local and territorial income taxes ==\n\nIncome tax is also levied by most U.S. states and many localities on individuals, corporations, estates, and trusts.', u'These taxes are in addition to federal income tax and are deductible for federal tax purposes.', u'State and local income tax rates vary from 1% to 16% of taxable income.', u'Some state and local income tax rates are flat (single rate) and some are graduated.', u'State and local definitions of what income is taxable vary highly.', u'Some states incorporate the federal definitions by reference.', u'Taxable income is defined separately and differently for individuals and corporations in some jurisdictions.', u'Some states impose alternative or additional taxes based on a second measure of income or capital.', u'States and localities tend to tax all income of residents.', u'States and localities only tax nonresidents on income allocated or apportioned to the jurisdiction.', u'Generally, nonresident individuals are taxed on wages earned in the state based on the portion of days worked in the state.', u'Many states require partnerships to pay tax for nonresident partners.', u'Tax returns are filed separately for states and localities imposing income tax, and may be due on dates that differ from federal due dates.', u'Some states permit related corporations to file combined or consolidated returns.', u'Most states and localities imposing income tax require estimated payments where tax exceeds certain thresholds, and require withholding tax on payment of wages.', u'Puerto Rico is treated as a separate taxing entity from the USA; its income tax rates are set independently, and only some residents there pay federal income taxes (though everyone must pay all other federal taxes).', u'The unincorporated territories Guam, American Samoa, and the Virgin Islands also impose income tax separately, under a "mirror" tax law based on federal income tax law.', u'== Controversies ==\n\n\n=== Proposals for changes of income taxation ===\nProposals have been made frequently to change tax laws, often with the backing of specific interest groups.', u'Organizations making such proposals include Citizens for Tax Justice, Americans for Tax Reform, Americans for Tax Fairness, Citizens for an Alternative Tax System, Americans For Fair Taxation, and FreedomWorks.', u'Various proposals have been put forth for tax simplification in Congress including the Fair Tax Act and various Flat tax plans.', u'=== Alternatives ===\nProponents of a consumption tax argue that the income tax system creates perverse incentives by encouraging taxpayers to spend rather than save: a taxpayer is only taxed once on income spent immediately, while any interest earned on saved income is itself taxed.', u'To the extent that this is considered unjust, it may be remedied in a variety of ways, e.g.', u'excluding investment income from taxable income, making investments deductible and therefore only taxing them when gains are realized, or replacing the income tax by other forms of tax, such as a sales tax.', u'=== Taxation vs. the states ===\nSome economists believe income taxation offers the federal government a technique to diminish the power of the states, because the federal government is then able to distribute funding to states with conditions attached, often giving the states no choice but to submit to federal demands.', u'=== Tax protestors ===\nNumerous tax protester arguments have been raised asserting that the federal income tax is unconstitutional, including discredited claims that the Sixteenth Amendment was not properly ratified.', u'All such claims have been repeatedly rejected by the federal courts as frivolous.', u'=== Distribution ===\n\nIn the United States, a progressive tax system is employed which equates to higher income earners paying a larger percentage of their income in taxes.', u'According to the IRS, the top 1% of income earners for 2008 paid 38% of income tax revenue, while earning 20% of the income reported.', u'The top 5% of income earners paid 59% of the total income tax revenue, while earning 35% of the income reported.', u'The top 10% paid 70%, earning 46% and the top 25% paid 86%, earning 67%.', u'The top 50% paid 97%, earning 87% and leaving the bottom 50% paying 3% of the taxes collected and earning 13% of the income reported.', u'From 1979 to 2007 the average federal income tax rate fell 110% for the second lowest quintile, 56% for the middle quintile, 39% for the fourth quintile, 8% for the highest quintile, and 15% for the top 1%, with the bottom quintile moving from a tax rate of zero to negative liability.', u'Despite this, individual income tax revenue only dropped from 8.7 to 8.5% of GDP over that time, and total federal revenue was 18.5% of GDP in both 1979 and 2007, above the postwar average of 18%.', u'Tax code changes have dropped millions of lower earning people from the federal income tax rolls in recent decades.', u'Those with zero or negative liability who were not claimed as dependents by a payer increased from 14.8% of the population in 1984 to 49.5% in 2009.', u'While there is consensus that overall federal taxation is progressive, there is dispute over whether progressivity has increased or decreased in recent decades, and by how much.', u'The total effective federal tax rate for the top 0.01% of income earners declined from around 75% to around 35% between 1960 and 2005.', u'Total effective federal tax rates fell from 19.1% to 12.5% for the three middle quintiles between 1979 and 2010, from 27.1% to 24% for the top quintile, from 7.5% to 1.5% for the bottom quintile, and from 35.1% to 29.4% for the top 1%.', u'A 2008 OECD study ranked 24 OECD nations by progressiveness of taxes and separately by progressiveness of cash transfers, which include pensions, unemployment and other benefits.', u'The United States had the highest concentration coefficient in income tax, a measure of progressiveness, before adjusting for income inequality.', u'The United States was not at the top of either measure for cash transfers.', u'Adjusting for income inequality, Ireland had the highest concentration coefficient for income taxes.', u'In 2008, overall income tax rates for the US were below the OECD average.', u'=== Effects on income inequality ===\n\nAccording to the CBO, U.S. federal tax policies substantially reduce income inequality measured after taxes.', u'Taxes became less progressive (i.e., they reduced income inequality relatively less) measured from 1979 to 2011.', u'The tax policies of the mid-1980s were the least progressive period since 1979.', u'Government transfer payments contributed more to reducing inequality than taxes.', u'== See also ==\nHylton v.

{'sentences': [u'An address is a collection of information, presented in a mostly fixed format, used to give the location of a building, apartment, or other structure or a plot of land, generally using political boundaries and street names as references, along with other identifiers such as house or apartment numbers.', u'Some addresses also contain special codes, such as a post code, to aid routing of mail.', u'== Functions ==\nAddresses have several functions:\nproviding a means of physically locating a building, especially in a city where there are many buildings and streets;\nidentifying buildings as the end points of a postal system;\nsignalling social status;\nas parameters in statistics collection, especially in census-taking and the insurance industry;\naddresses are the most accepted representation of a location.', u'Addresses may have drawbacks:\nThey are a non-standardised means of representing a location;\nThey do not contain the coordinates of the location they represent.', u'== History ==\nUntil the advent of modern postal systems around the 18th-19th century, most houses and buildings were not numbered.', u'Streets may have been named for landmarks, such as a city gate or market, or for the professions of their inhabitants.', u'In many cities in Asia, most minor streets were never named.', u'This is still the case today in much of Japan.', u'A local postman would be familiar with the area and thus able to deliver mail, but as postal systems developed, it became necessary to number buildings to aid in mail delivery.', u'== Current addressing schemes ==\n\n\n=== House numbering or naming ===\n\nIn most English-speaking countries, the usual method of house numbering is an alternating numbering scheme progressing in one direction along a street, with odd numbers on one side (often west or south or the left-hand side leading away from a main road) and even numbers on the other side, although there is significant variation on this basic pattern.', u'Many older towns and cities in the UK have "up and down" numbering where the numbers progress sequentially along one side of the road, and then sequentially back down the other side.', u'Cities in North America, particularly those planned on a grid plan, often incorporate block numbers, quadrants (explained below), and cardinal directions into their street numbers, so that in many such cities, addresses roughly follow a Cartesian coordinate system.', u'Some other cities around the world have their own schemes.', u'Although house numbering is the principal identification scheme in many parts of the world, it is also common for houses in the United Kingdom and Ireland to be identified by name, rather than number, especially in villages.', u'In these cases, the street name will usually follow the house name.', u'Such an address might read: "Smith Cottage, Frog Lane, Barchester, Barsetshire, BZ9 9BA" or "Dunroamin, Emo, Co. Laois, Ireland" (fictional examples).', u'=== Quadrants ===\nIn cities with Cartesian-coordinate-based addressing systems, the streets that form the north-south and east-west dividing lines constitute the x and y axes of a Cartesian coordinate plane and thus divide the city into quadrants.', u'The quadrants are typically identified in the street names, although the manner of doing so varies from city to city.', u'For example, in one city, all streets in the northeast quadrant may have "NE" prefixed or suffixed to their street names, while in another, the intersection of North Calvert Street and East 27th Street can be only in the northeast quadrant.', u'=== Street-naming conventions ===\nStreet names may follow a variety of themes.', u'In many North American cities, such as, San Francisco USA, and Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, streets are simply numbered sequentially across the street grid.', u'Washington, D.C. has its numbered streets running north-south and lettered or alphabetically named streets running east-west, while diagonal avenues are typically named after states.', u'In Salt Lake City, and many other Utah cities, streets are in a large grid and are numbered in increments of 100 based on their location relative to the center of the city in blocks.', u'A similar system is in use in Detroit with the Mile Road System.', u'In some housing developments in North America and elsewhere, street names may all follow the same theme (for example, bird species), or start with the same letter.', u'Streets in Continental Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America are often named after famous people or significant dates.', u'=== Postal codes ===\nPostal codes are a relatively recent development in addressing, designed to speed the sorting and processing of mail by assigning unique numeric or alphanumeric codes to each geographical locality.', u"=== Postal alternatives to physical addresses ===\nFor privacy and other purposes, postal services have made it possible to receive mail without revealing one's physical address or even having a fixed physical address.", u'Examples are post office boxes, service addresses and poste restante (general delivery).', u'== Address format ==\n\nIn most of the world, addresses are written in order from most specific to general, i.e.', u'finest to coarsest information, starting with the addressee and ending with the largest geographical unit.', u'For example:\nIn English-speaking countries, the postal code usually comes last.', u'In much of Europe, the code precedes the town name, thus: "1010 Lausanne".', u'Often, the country code is still placed in front of the postal code: "CH-1010 Lausanne".', u'However, this is no longer demanded by postal authorities and has even been forbidden in certain countries.', u'If a house number is provided, it is written on the same line as the street name; a house name is written on the previous line.', u'When addresses are written inline, line breaks are replaced by commas.', u'Conventions on the placing of house numbers differ: either before or after the street name.', u'Similarly, there are differences in the placement of postal codes: in the UK, they are written on a separate line at the end of the address; in Australia, Canada and the United States, they usually appear immediately after the state or province, on the same line; in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany and The Netherlands they appear before the city, on the same line.', u'East Asian addressing systems, including Chinese, Japanese and Korean addressing systems, when written in their native scripts, use the opposite ordering, starting with the province/prefecture, ending with the addressee.', u'However both have the same order as western countries when written in the Latin alphabet.', u'The Hungarian system also goes from large to small units, except the name of the addressee is put into the first line.', u'The Universal Postal Convention strongly recommends the following:\n"The addressee\u2019s address shall be worded in a precise and complete manner.', u'It shall be written very legibly in roman letters and arabic numerals.', u'If other letters and numerals are used in the country of destination, it shall be recommended that the address be given also in these letters and numerals.', u'The name of the place of destination and the name of the country of destination shall be written in capital letters together with the correct postcode number or delivery zone number or post office box number, if any.', u'The name of the country of destination shall be written preferably in the language of the country of origin.', u'To avoid any difficulty in the countries of transit, it is desirable for the name of the country of destination to be added in an internationally known language.', u'Designated operators may recommend that, on items addressed to countries where the recommended position of the postcode is in front of the name of the location of destination, the postcode should be preceded by the EN ISO 3166\u20131 Alpha 2 country code followed by a hyphen.', u'This shall in no way detract from the requirement for the name of the destination country to be printed in full."', u'== Mailing address format by country ==\n\n\n=== Argentina ===\nIn Argentina, an address must be mailed this way:\nThe postal code has been changed from a four digit format to an eight digit format, which is shown in the example.', u'The new format adds a district or province letter code at the beginning, which allows it to be identified.', u'As the system has been changed recently, the four digit format can still be used: in that case it is necessary to add the name of the province or district.', u'=== Australia ===\nIn common with the rest of the English-speaking world, addresses in Australia put the street number\u2014which may be a range\u2014before the street name, and the placename before the postcode.', u'Unlike addresses in most other comparable places, the city is not included in the address, but rather a much more fine-grained locality is used, usually referred to in Australia as a suburb or town \u2013 although these words are understood in a different way than in other countries.', u'Because the suburb or town serves to locate the street or delivery type, the postcode serves only as routing information rather than to distinguish previous other parts of an address.', u'As an example, there are around 8000 localities in Victoria (cf.', u'List of localities in Victoria (Australia) and List of Melbourne suburbs), yet around 700 unique geographic postcodes.', u'For certain large volume receivers or post offices, the "locality" may be an institution or street name.', u'It is always considered incorrect to include the city or metropolis name in an address (unless this happens to be the name of the suburb), and doing so may delay delivery.', u'Australia Post recommends that the last line of the address should be set in capital letters.', u'In Australia, subunits are essential and should be separated from the street by two spaces; apartments, flats and units are typically separated with a forward slash instead.', u'As in the US, the state/territory is crucial information as many placenames are reused in different states/territories; it is usually separated from the suburb with two spaces and abbreviated.', u'In printed matter, the postcode follows after two spaces; in handwritten matter, the postcode should be written in the boxes provided.', u'In addition to PO Boxes, other delivery types (which are typically abbreviated) may include:\nAustralian Post Addressing Guidelines\n\n\n=== Austria ===\nIn Austria, the address is generally formatted as follows:\nThe postal code always consists of four digits.', u'=== Bangladesh ===\nIn Bangladesh, the format used for rural and urban addresses is different.', u'Urban Addresses\nThe postal code always consists of four digits.', u"Rural Addresses\n\n\n=== Belarus ===\nSome neighbourhoods may be planned in such a way that some, or most, apartment buildings don't face a named street.", u'In this case, a number of expedients can be used.', u'In older neighbourhoods, a "main" building may have the same number as one or more "subsidiary" buildings accessible via driveways behind the main building.', u'They will be addressed as vul.', u'Lenina, d. 123 (123 Lenin St) An address may also cover one or more subsidiary buildings behind the main building, addressed as vul.', u'Lenina, d. 123, bud.', u'2 (123 Lenin St, unit 2, where bud.', u"(abbreviation for \u0431\u0443\u0434\u044b\u043d\u0430\u043a, budynak) means a '(subsidiary) building').", u"In newer areas with more regular street plans, apartment buildings that don't face a named street may be designated with Cyrillic letters appended to the building number, e.g.", u'123-\u0430, 123-\u0431, etc., in Cyrillic alphabetical order.', u'In some microraion neighbourhoods, with few, if any, buildings facing named streets, the name (or more likely number of the microraion (planned housing development)) would be used instead of the street name; thus someone may live at 4-th microrayon, d. 123, kv.', u'56, i.e.', u'123 - 4th Microraion, apt.', u'56.', u'Source: Belposhta\n\n\n=== Belgium ===\nThe address starts with the most specific information (addressee individual identification) and ends with the most general information (postcode and town for domestic mail or country for cross border mail.)', u'Spatial information of a physical address (including building, wing, stairwell, floor and door) may be useful for internal path of delivery, but is not allowed in the delivery point location line (i.e.', u'the line containing street, number and box number).', u'If needed, this information will appear on a line above the delivery point location line.', u'The street number is placed after the thoroughfare name (unlike in France), separated by a space.', u'Separators such as punctuation (point, comma or other signs) or \u2018n\xb0\u2019, or \u2018nr\u2019 are not allowed.', u'Extension designation (box numbers), if present, appears in the delivery point location line, preceded by the word for "box" (bus in Dutch, bte in French).', u'Symbols such as b, Bt, #, -, / are not allowed as separators between the street number element and the box number element.', u'Example of a correctly formatted postal address:\nThe Belgian addressing guidelines are registered with the Universal Postal Union (UPU and see the link http://www.upu.int/en/activities/addressing/postal-addressing-systems-in-member-countries.html).', u'These guidelines indicate exactly how to combine the various address components in order to obtain a correctly formatted postal address.', u'The complete set of addressing guidelines can be found on the website of the Belgian postal operator (bpost).', u'The correct representation of an address is not limited to the correct structure of address components but also relates to the content of addresses and their position on envelopes (see http://www.bpost.be/site/fr/residential/letters-cards/send/best_practices.html (in French)).', u"It is also possible to validate a Belgian postal address on bpost's website and to receive feedback on the content and the format of an address.", u"More information can be found on bpost's website (see http://www.bpost.be/validationadresse/ (in French)).", u'=== Brazil ===\nIn Brazil, an address must be mailed this way:\nStates can have their name written entirely, abbreviated in some way, or totally abbreviated to two letters (SP = S\xe3o Paulo, RJ = Rio de Janeiro, etc.).', u'Only towns with 60,000 inhabitants and above have postal codes individualized for streets, roads, avenues, etc.', u'One way can have several postal codes (by odd/even numbers side or by segment).', u'These postcodes range from -000 to -899.', u'Other towns have only a generic postcode with the suffix -000.', u'Recipients of bulk mail (large companies, condos, etc.)', u'have specific postcodes, with a suffix ranging from -900 to -959.', u'P.O.', u'boxes are mailed to Correios offices, with suffixes ranging from -970 to -979.', u'Some rural settlements have communitarian postboxes with suffix -990.', u'=== Canada ===\nAddressing guidelines can differ between English- and French-speaking populations in Canada.', u'Here are some formatting rules that are used in common:\nCardinal directions like North, North West, etc.', u'can be abbreviated in either English or French, and appear after the street name.', u'Ordinal numbered streets (e.g.', u'6th, 2nd) can be written in either English or French.', u'Postal codes come in a letter-number-letter-space-number-letter-number format, for example: A1A 1A1.', u'There should be two spaces between the province abbreviation and the postal code.', u'If sending a parcel from outside Canada, the word "CANADA" must be placed at the very bottom.', u'If there is an apartment number it should be written before the house number and separated by a hyphen.', u'The postal code is then separated by two spaces and should be written on the same line as the city and province.', u'See the example below for a comparison of the English and French address formats.', u"English (from Canada Post):\n\nNICOLE MARTIN\n123 SHERBROOKE ST\nTORONTO ON  L3R 9P6\n\nFrench (from OQLF):\n\nMonsieur Jean-Pierre Lamarre\n101-3485, rue de la Montagne\nMontr\xe9al (Qu\xe9bec)  H3G 2A6\n\nSee Canada Post's Addressing Guidelines for accurate, up-to-date information on the addressing guidelines most commonly used in Canada.", u"See the Office qu\xe9b\xe9cois de la langue fran\xe7aise's Adressage webpage (in French only) for more information about how to write an address according to guidelines used in Quebec and other French-speaking areas.", u'=== Chile ===\nChilean urban addresses require only the street name, house number, apartment number (if necessary) and municipality; however, more information is frequently included, such as neighbourhood, city, region.', u'Postal codes are rarely included by people.', u'All postal codes have seven digits, the first three indicating the municipality, the next four identifying a block or in large and scarcely populated areas a quadrant within the municipal territory.', u'The territories of most of the larger cities comprise several adjacent municipalities, so it is important to mention it.', u'Smaller cities often consist of only one municipality with several unofficial neighbourhoods that are usually mentioned even for official addressing purposes.', u'Several large and mostly rural municipalities contain more than one small town, in such cases, the recipient address must mention either the town, the postal code or both.', u'=== China ===\nThe Postal area when written in Chinese characters (preferably Simplified Chinese characters), has the order of the largest unit first, ending with the addressee, i.e.', u'country, province, municipality, town, street or road, building name, floor/level, house/flat number, company name, addressee.', u'This is the most common language used when posting within China.', u'The whole address is commonly written as a string of characters with no particular format regarding where a new line would start, similar to one long sentence, with any new lines appearing depending on the space available on the envelope.', u'Generally, the district is omitted when posting within China.', u'=== Croatia ===\nCroatia uses five-digit postal code numbers.', u'The Croatian postal service recommends using 2-letter ISO country codes as prefixes before international and domestic postal codes, though the practice is not mandatory.', u'=== Czech Republic ===\nCommon format in Czech Republic:\nPostal codes are in the format "### ##" (i.e.', u'158 00 = Prague 58) or "CZ-#####" (especially for international sendings).', u'At pre-printed Czech postcards and envelopes, the postal code is filled into frames at separate last row.', u"If the envelope doesn't have pre-printed rows and frames, the postal code should be before the town (or post office) name.", u'In private mails, the first line is usually constituted by a courtesy title (pan, pan\xed, sle\u010dna, \u017e\xe1k\u2026) For private mails addressed to the workplace, the order is inverse (name + company) as in official mails (company + name).', u'The basic system of house numbering are conscription house numbers (\u010d\xedsla popisn\xe1, \u010dp.', u'or \u010d. p.).', u'In case of temporary or recreational house, an evidentional house number (\u010d\xedslo eviden\u010dn\xed, ev.', u'\u010d. or \u010de., or distinguished by initial 0 or E prefix) is used instead.', u'In most of bigger cities and also in some towns and big villages with street names, there is double system of house numbering.', u'As the first number is used the conscription or evidentional number (which corresponds to the chronologic order of cadastral registration of the house), as the second number (past a slash) is used the orientational number (orienta\u010dn\xed \u010d\xedslo, \u010d.', u'or., \u010d.', u'o.)', u'which expresses position on the street.', u'Sometimes, only one of the two numbers is used or the numbers are used in inversed order and it can be difficult to distinguish which number is which.', u'Generally, orientation numbers (if exists) are preferred for mail services.', u'Ex.', u': Josef Nov\xe1k, Brn\u011bnsk\xe1 2256/16, 123 07 Jitrnice\nHow to correctly label the consignment\n\n\n=== Denmark ===\n\nIn Denmark, apartment buildings will usually have two or three apartments per floor.', u'Thus, if the addressee lives in an apartment, the address should contain the floor they live on, and a side (t.v., mf.', u'or t.h., meaning "to the left", "in the middle" and "to the right", respectively) or an alphanumeric character (1,2,3... or A,B,C...= starting from left seen from the top most step just before the floor).', u'Also, for postal codes 2000 and up, there is a 1:1 relationship between postal code and town.', u"=== Estonia ===\n\n\n=== Finland ===\nIf a person's name is written before the company name in the address field of a letter, then that person is considered the recipient.", u'In this case, no other employee is allowed to open the letter but the indicated recipient.', u"If the company name is before the person's name, then the company is the recipient and any employee is allowed to open the letter.", u'* apartment number can formulated as "as 5" (as = asunto, \'apartment\' in English) or as "C 55" (the letter A, B, C ... indicates the correct staircase in apartment blocks with several entrances)\nFinland uses a five-digit postal code.', u'Note that some of the larger companies and organizations have their own postal codes.', u'=== France ===\nIn France, the address is generally formatted as follows:\nThe postal code always consists of five digits.', u'Organisations, government agencies, and companies which receive large amounts of mail often have a special "CEDEX" address which goes after the last line (for instance, "75001 PARIS CEDEX").', u'=== Germany ===\nIn Germany, the address is generally formatted as follows:\nThe postal code always consists of five digits.', u'Organizations that receive large amounts of mail may be assigned a bulk customer postal code.', u'These are different from regular postal codes in that they do not have a street name line.', u'Some bulk customer postal codes are shared between several organizations.', u'There are a few places that have house numbers but no street names (e.g.', u'Baltrum) as well as addresses that have a street name but no house number.', u'Some (but not all) private post companies are also able to deliver to Deutsche Post-operated P.O.', u'boxes.', u"Post codes follow the structure of DPAG's mail routing, not administrative boundaries.", u'Each post code is used exclusively for street addresses, P.O.', u'boxes or bulk recipients.', u'Sub-building information, such as apartment numbers, is rarely used - a name on the post box is usually the only method of identification of an addressee within a building.', u"=== Greece ===\nHellenic Post recommends the following format for Greek addresses:\nThe most widespread format, shown above, gives at the last line the recipient's five-digit post code (with a single space between the third and fourth digits) and the name of the town or village that is the base of a post office, in capital letters and separated from the postcode by two spaces.", u'When sending mail abroad, or when sending mail from abroad to Greece, Hellenic Post recommends the following format:\nLike mail for delivery within the country, mail sent from abroad must contain the postcode in the same manner, but the postcode must be preceded by the international prefix of the country of delivery (for Greece, GR).', u'Below the destination, the country of delivery must be written in capital letters, either in English or French (for Greece, GR\xc8CE or GREECE).', u'=== Hong Kong ===\nThe official languages of Hong Kong are English and Cantonese Chinese.', u'For domestic mail within Hong Kong, the address may be written entirely in either English or Chinese.', u'For overseas mail going out from Hong Kong, the address may be written in the language of the destination country, provided that the city name and the country name are in English.', u'However, for an overseas mail from Hong Kong to China, Macao, Taiwan or Singapore, the address may be written entirely in Chinese.', u"While traditional Chinese characters are commonly used in Hong Kong, simplified Chinese characters are also understood by Hong Kong's postmen.", u'Note that Hong Kong does not use any postal codes, though many rural properties have a property identification code, e.g.', u'HKT-12345.', u'An address written in English should begin with the smallest unit and end with the largest unit, as in the following example for a domestic mail within Hong Kong.', u'An address written in Chinese should begin with the largest unit and end with the smallest unit, as in the following example for a piece of domestic mail within Hong Kong.', u'Traditional Chinese characters are used in this example.', u'For mail to Hong Kong from overseas, "Hong Kong" should be added at the end of an address written in English, and "\u9999\u6e2f" should be added at the beginning of an address written in Chinese.', u'=== Hungary ===\nIn Hungarian mail addresses, the town name precedes the street address.', u'The postal code consists of four digits.', u'=== Iceland ===\n\n\n=== India ===\nThe format used for rural and urban addresses is different.', u'Rural Addresses\nUrban Addresses\nThe state is optional in both cases, but is typically used.', u'=== Indonesia ===\nIn Indonesia, the address format is like this:\nGenerally "Jalan" or "Jl."', u"means 'street' and should go before the street name, e.g.", u'Jalan Cemara.', u'More info about Indonesia administrative divisions see Administrative divisions of Indonesia.', u'=== Iran ===\nPostal addresses in Iran has a standard which should be used by mail or parcel senders.', u'This standard is registered and qualified in Universal Postal Union (UPU).', u'According to the below table, Iran has 4 types of standard address:\n\n\n=== Iraq ===\n\n\n=== Ireland ===\n\nIn July 2015 Ireland introduced Eircodes, a seven digit alphanumeric code, consisting of a 3 character routing key and a 4 character unique identifier for the property.', u'Example A65 F4E2.', u"Up until the introduction of Eircode's Dublin was the only county with a form of postal district identifier, these have been incorporated into the Eircode scheme; example Dublin 2 is routing code D02.", u'Rural addresses are specified by the county, nearest post town, and the townland.', u'Urban addresses are specified by county, city or town name, street name, house number, and apartment or flat number where relevant.', u'A house name may be used instead of a number.', u'The Eircode is appended to the bottom of the address.', u'=== Israel ===\nBasic format\nExample of common address with apartment number\nExample of common address with building entrance and apartment number\nOr\n\n\n=== Italy ===\nAn internal address, in Italy, must be composed of three to five rows.', u'Up to six rows can be used if the mail is sent abroad:\nLine ordering may not be changed.', u'=== Japan ===\n\nA Japanese postal address, when written in Japanese phonetic and Chinese characters, starts with the largest geographical division, continues with progressively smallers subdivisions before ending with the addressee, i.e.', u'country, prefecture, town, ch\u014dme, banchi, building number, building name, floor number, company name, addressee.', u'This is the most common addressing format used when mailing within Japan.', u"It is common practice to add the appropriate honorific to the addressee's name, e.g.", u'\u69d8 for a private individual or \u5fa1\u4e2d for a company or institution.', u'When written in the Latin alphabet, the address begins with the smallest geographical area and ends with the largest one as in the following example.', u'Macrons (as on \u014d and \u016b) may be omitted.', u'Japanese-style envelopes are vertically aligned and the address is written from top to bottom, then right to left.', u'Western-style envelopes are horizontally aligned and the address is written from left to right, top to bottom.', u'=== South Korea ===\n\nSouth Korea uses a system similar to Western addressing, but previously used a system similar to Japanese addressing.', u'South Korean addresses start with the largest unit (country, province), like those other East Asian countries.', u'=== Latvia ===\nIn Latvia, the address in generally formatted as follows:\nNotes:\nEvery address element should be written on a separate line, starting with the more detailed element.', u'In Latvian, addressee\u2019s name should be provided in dative, i.g., \u201cAndrim Liepam\u201d.', u'There are two generally accepted official salutation forms you can use in front of the addressee\'s name: "A.god."', u'(with a man\'s name) or "\u013b.cien."', u"(with a man's or woman's name).", u'Indicate a full street name, house and flat number (if applicable).', u'Separate house and flat number with a hyphen.', u'It is allowed to use abbreviation of parish ("pag."', u'- abbreviation of "pagasts") and amalgamated municipality ("nov." - abbreviation of "novads").', u'The postal code consists of two capital letters (LV) and four digits separated with a hyphen.', u'For cross-border mail after the postal code you need to indicate the country of destination in block letters.', u'Further references: Latvijas Pasts\n\n\n=== Macau ===\nThe official languages of Macau are Portuguese and Cantonese.', u'For domestic mail within Macau, the address may be written entirely in either Portuguese or Chinese.', u'For overseas mail going out from Macau, the address may be written in the language of the destination country, provided that the city name and the country name are in English.', u'However, for an overseas mail from Macau to China, Hong Kong, Taiwan or Singapore, the address may be written entirely in Chinese.', u"While traditional Chinese characters are commonly used in Macau, simplified Chinese characters are also understood by Macau's postmen.", u'Note that Macau does not use any postal codes.', u'An address written in Portuguese should begin with the street name and end with the area in Macau, as in the following example for a domestic mail within Macau.', u'An address written in Chinese should begin with the largest unit and end with the smallest unit, as in the following example for a piece of domestic mail within Macau.', u'Traditional Chinese characters are used in this example.', u'For mail to Macau from overseas, "Macau" should be added at the end of an address written in Portuguese, and "Macao" at the end of an address written in English; "\u6fb3\u9580" should be added at the beginning of an address written in Chinese.', u'=== Malaysia ===\n\nPos Malaysia recommends the following formats:\nNotes:\nThe Country line MALAYSIA is always omitted when mailing from within Malaysia.', u'The State line is strictly optional, the mailing system will not be affected if the State line is omitted.', u'The Post office/Mail centre field is the name of the town/city which post office/mail centre jurisdiction covers the mailing address, and in several cases, may not be the actual town/city which the address is geographically located.', u'It is recommended to have the Post office/Mail centre written in block letters, e.g.', u'KUALA LUMPUR.', u'The postcode is always in the 5-digit format and must correspond to the respective post office / mail centre.', u'Pos Malaysia allows usage of P.O.', u'Box for both residential and business addresses.', u'Whenever a P.O.', u'Box address is used, its respective postcode and post office/mail centre must be written on the last line of an address.', u'If both postcodes are present (original and P.O.', u'Box), mail will be sent to the P.O.', u'Box on its first attempt.', u'=== Mexico ===\nCorreos de M\xe9xico recommends the following formats:\n\n\n=== Netherlands ===\nIn the Netherlands, the address is generally formatted as follows:\nThe postal code is a unique street identifier, and always consists of four numbers followed by a space and then two capital letters.', u'PostNL, which is appointed by the Dutch government to carry out the UPD (Dutch for Universal Postal Service), recommends putting two spaces between postal code and town.', u'Also, the name of the town should be written in capitals.', u'Because the Dutch postal code uniquely identifies a street, a shortened format may also be used.', u'This method only needs

{'sentences': [u'Spain (/\u02c8spe\u026an/; Spanish: Espa\xf1a [es\u02c8pa\u0272a]), officially the Kingdom of Spain (Spanish: Reino de Espa\xf1a), is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast.', u'Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean.', u'It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla.', u'Along with France and Morocco, it is one of only three countries to have both Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlines.', u'With an area of 505,990 km2 (195,360 sq mi), Spain is the largest country in Southern Europe, the second largest country in Western Europe and the European Union, and the fourth largest country in the European continent.', u'By population, Spain is the sixth largest in Europe and the fifth in the European Union, after Italy.', u"Spain's capital and largest city is Madrid, other major urban areas include Barcelona, Valencia, Seville, Bilbao and M\xe1laga.", u'Modern humans first arrived in the Iberian Peninsula around 35,000 years ago.', u'Iberian cultures along with ancient Phoenician, Greek and Carthaginian settlements developed on the peninsula until it came under Roman rule around 200 BCE, after which the region was named Hispania, based on the earlier Phoenician name Span or Spania.', u'In the Middle Ages, the area was conquered by Germanic tribes and later by the Moors.', u'Spain emerged as a unified country in the 15th century, following the marriage of the Catholic Monarchs and the completion of the centuries-long reconquest, or Reconquista, of the peninsula from the Moors in 1492.', u"In the early modern period, Spain became one of history's first global colonial empires, leaving a vast cultural and linguistic legacy that includes over 500 million Spanish speakers, making Spanish the world's second most spoken first language, after Chinese and before English.", u'Spain is a democracy organised in the form of a parliamentary government under a constitutional monarchy.', u"It is a middle power and a developed country with the world's fourteenth largest economy by nominal GDP and sixteenth largest by purchasing power parity.", u'It is a member of the United Nations (UN), the European Union (EU), the Council of Europe (CoE), the Organization of Ibero-American States (OEI), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO) and many other international organisations.', u'== Etymology ==\nThe origins of the Roman name Hispania, from which the modern name Espa\xf1a was derived, are uncertain due to inadequate evidence, although it is documented that the Phoenicians and Carthaginians referred to the region as Spania, the most widely accepted etymology is a Semitic - Phoenician.', u'Down the centuries there have been a number of accounts and hypotheses:\n\nThe Renaissance scholar Antonio de Nebrija proposed that the word Hispania evolved from the Iberian word Hispalis, meaning "city of the western world".', u'Jes\xfas Luis Cunchillos argues that the root of the term span is the Phoenician word spy, meaning "to forge metals".', u'Therefore, i-spn-ya would mean "the land where metals are forged".', u'It may be a derivation of the Phoenician I-Shpania, meaning "island of rabbits", "land of rabbits" or "edge", a reference to Spain\'s location at the end of the Mediterranean; Roman coins struck in the region from the reign of Hadrian show a female figure with a rabbit at her feet, and Strabo called it the "land of the rabbits".', u'Hispania may derive from the poetic use of the term Hesperia, reflecting the Greek perception of Italy as a "western land" or "land of the setting sun" (Hesperia, \u1f19\u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 in Greek) and Spain, being still further west, as Hesperia ultima.', u'There is the claim that "Hispania" derives from the Basque word Ezpanna meaning "edge" or "border", another reference to the fact that the Iberian Peninsula constitutes the southwest corner of the European continent.', u'Two 15th-century Spanish Jewish scholars, Don Isaac Abravanel and Solomon ibn Verga, gave an explanation now considered folkloric.', u'Both men wrote in two different published works that the first Jews to reach Spain were brought by ship by Phiros who was confederate with the king of Babylon when he laid siege to Jerusalem.', u'This man was a Grecian by birth, but who had been given a kingdom in Spain.', u'He became related by marriage to Espan, the nephew of king Heracles, who also ruled over a kingdom in Spain.', u'Heracles later renounced his throne in preference for his native Greece, leaving his kingdom to his nephew, Espan, from whom the country of Espa\xf1a (Spain) took its name.', u'Based upon their testimonies, this eponym would have already been in use in Spain by c. 350 BCE.', u'== History ==\n\nIberia enters written records as a land populated largely by the Iberians, Basques and Celts.', u'After an arduous conquest, the peninsula came under the rule of the Roman Empire.', u'During the early Middle Ages it came under Germanic rule but later, much of it was conquered by Moorish invaders from North Africa.', u'In a process that took centuries, the small Christian kingdoms in the north gradually regained control of the peninsula.', u'The last Moorish kingdom fell in the same year Columbus reached the Americas.', u'A global empire began which saw Spain become the strongest kingdom in Europe, the leading world power for a century and a half, and the largest overseas empire for three centuries.', u'Continued wars and other problems eventually led to a diminished status.', u'The Napoleonic invasions of Spain led to chaos, triggering independence movements that tore apart most of the empire and left the country politically unstable.', u'Prior to the Second World War, Spain suffered a devastating civil war and came under the rule of an authoritarian government, which oversaw a period of stagnation that was followed by a surge in the growth of the economy.', u'Eventually democracy was peacefully restored in the form of a parliamentary constitutional monarchy.', u'Spain joined the European Union, experiencing a cultural renaissance and steady economic growth.', u'=== Prehistory and pre-Roman peoples ===\n\nArchaeological research at Atapuerca indicates the Iberian Peninsula was populated by hominids 1.2 million years ago.', u'In Atapuerca fossils have been found of the earliest known hominins in Europe, the Homo antecessor.', u'Modern humans first arrived in Iberia, from the north on foot, about 35,000 years ago.', u'The best known artefacts of these prehistoric human settlements are the famous paintings in the Altamira cave of Cantabria in northern Iberia, which were created from 35,600 to 13,500 BCE by Cro-Magnon.', u'Archaeological and genetic evidence suggests that the Iberian Peninsula acted as one of several major refugia from which northern Europe was repopulated following the end of the last ice age.', u'The largest groups inhabiting the Iberian Peninsula before the Roman conquest were the Iberians and the Celts.', u'The Iberians inhabited the Mediterranean side of the peninsula, from the northeast to the southeast.', u'The Celts inhabited much of the inner and Atlantic sides of the peninsula, from the northwest to the southwest.', u'Basques occupied the western area of the Pyrenees mountain range and adjacent areas, the Tartessians were in the southwest and the Lusitanians and Vettones occupied areas in the central west.', u'A number of trading settlements of Phoenicians, Greeks and Carthaginians developed on the Mediterranean coast.', u'=== Roman Empire and the Gothic Kingdom ===\n\nDuring the Second Punic War, an expanding Roman Republic captured Carthaginian trading colonies along the Mediterranean coast from roughly 210 to 205 BC.', u'It took the Romans nearly two centuries to complete the conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, though they had control of it for over six centuries.', u'Roman rule was bound together by law, language, and the Roman road.', u'The cultures of the Celtic and Iberian populations were gradually Romanised (Latinised) at differing rates in different parts of Hispania.', u'Local leaders were admitted into the Roman aristocratic class.', u'Hispania served as a granary for the Roman market, and its harbours exported gold, wool, olive oil, and wine.', u'Agricultural production increased with the introduction of irrigation projects, some of which remain in use.', u'Emperors Hadrian, Trajan, Theodosius I, and the philosopher Seneca were born in Hispania.', u'Christianity was introduced into Hispania in the 1st century AD and it became popular in the cities in the 2nd century AD.', u"Most of Spain's present languages and religion, and the basis of its laws, originate from this period.", u"The weakening of the Western Roman Empire's jurisdiction in Hispania began in 409, when the Germanic Suebi and Vandals, together with the Sarmatian Alans, crossed the Rhine and ravaged Gaul until the Visigoths drove them into Iberia that same year.", u'The Suebi established a kingdom in what is today modern Galicia and northern Portugal.', u'As the western empire disintegrated, the social and economic base became greatly simplified: but even in modified form, the successor regimes maintained many of the institutions and laws of the late empire, including Christianity and assimilation to the evolving Roman culture.', u"The Alans' allies, the Hasdingi Vandals, established a kingdom in Gallaecia, too, occupying largely the same region but extending farther south to the Douro river.", u'The Silingi Vandals occupied the region that still bears a form of their name\u2014Vandalusia, modern Andalusia, in Spain.', u'The Byzantines established an enclave, Spania, in the south, with the intention of reviving the Roman empire throughout Iberia.', u'Eventually, however, Hispania was reunited under Visigothic rule.', u'Isidore of Seville, archbishop of Seville, was an influential philosopher and was much studied in the Middle Ages in Europe.', u'Also, his theories were vital to the conversion of the Visigothic Kingdom to a Catholic one, in the Councils of Toledo.', u'This Gothic kingdom was the first Christian kingdom ruling in the Iberian Peninsula, and in the Reconquista it was the referent for the different kingdoms fighting against the Muslim rule.', u'=== Middle Ages: Muslim era and Reconquista ===\n\nIn the 8th century, nearly all of the Iberian Peninsula was conquered (711\u2013718) by largely Moorish Muslim armies from North Africa.', u'These conquests were part of the expansion of the Umayyad Caliphate.', u'Only a small area in the mountainous north-west of the peninsula managed to resist the initial invasion.', u'Under Islamic law, Christians and Jews were given the subordinate status of dhimmi.', u'This status permitted Christians and Jews to practice their religions as People of the Book but they were required to pay a special tax and had legal and social rights inferior to those of Muslims.', u'Conversion to Islam proceeded at an increasing pace.', u'The mulad\xedes (Muslims of ethnic Iberian origin) are believed to have comprised the majority of the population of Al-Andalus by the end of the 10th century.', u'The Muslim community in the Iberian Peninsula was itself diverse and beset by social tensions.', u'The Berber people of North Africa, who had provided the bulk of the invading armies, clashed with the Arab leadership from the Middle East.', u'Over time, large Moorish populations became established, especially in the Guadalquivir River valley, the coastal plain of Valencia, the Ebro River valley and (towards the end of this period) in the mountainous region of Granada.', u'C\xf3rdoba, the capital of the caliphate since Abd-ar-Rahman III, was the largest, richest and most sophisticated city in western Europe.', u'Mediterranean trade and cultural exchange flourished.', u'Muslims imported a rich intellectual tradition from the Middle East and North Africa.', u'Muslim and Jewish scholars played an important part in reviving and expanding classical Greek learning in Western Europe.', u'Some important philosophers at the time were Averroes, Ibn Arabi and Maimonides.', u'The Romanised cultures of the Iberian Peninsula interacted with Muslim and Jewish cultures in complex ways, giving the region a distinctive culture.', u'Outside the cities, where the vast majority lived, the land ownership system from Roman times remained largely intact as Muslim leaders rarely dispossessed landowners and the introduction of new crops and techniques led to an expansion of agriculture.', u'In the 11th century, the Muslim holdings fractured into rival Taifa kingdoms, allowing the small Christian states the opportunity to greatly enlarge their territories.', u'The arrival from North Africa of the Islamic ruling sects of the Almoravids and the Almohads restored unity upon the Muslim holdings, with a stricter, less tolerant application of Islam, and saw a revival in Muslim fortunes.', u'This re-united Islamic state experienced more than a century of successes that partially reversed Christian gains.', u'The Reconquista (Reconquest) was the centuries-long period in which Christian rule was re-established over the Iberian Peninsula.', u'The Reconquista is viewed as beginning with the Battle of Covadonga won by Don Pelayo in 722 and was concurrent with the period of Muslim rule on the Iberian Peninsula.', u"The Christian army's victory over Muslim forces led to the creation of the Christian Kingdom of Asturias along the northwestern coastal mountains.", u"Shortly after, in 739, Muslim forces were driven from Galicia, which was to eventually host one of medieval Europe's holiest sites, Santiago de Compostela and was incorporated into the new Christian kingdom.", u'The Kingdom of Le\xf3n was the strongest Christian kingdom for centuries.', u'In 1188 the first modern parliamentary session in Europe was held in Le\xf3n (Cortes of Le\xf3n).', u'The Kingdom of Castile, formed from Leonese territory, was its successor as strongest kingdom.', u'The kings and the nobility fought for power and influence in this period.', u'The example of the Roman emperors influenced the political objective of the Crown, while the nobles benefited from feudalism.', u'Muslim armies had also moved north of the Pyrenees but they were defeated by Frankish forces at the Battle of Poitiers, Frankia.', u'Later, Frankish forces established Christian counties on the southern side of the Pyrenees.', u'These areas were to grow into the kingdoms of Navarre and Aragon.', u'For several centuries, the fluctuating frontier between the Muslim and Christian controlled areas of Iberia was along the Ebro and Douro valleys.', u'The County of Barcelona and the Kingdom of Aragon entered in a dynastic union and gained territory and power in the Mediterranean.', u'In 1229 Majorca was conquered, so was Valencia in 1238.', u'The break-up of Al-Andalus into the competing taifa kingdoms helped the long embattled Iberian Christian kingdoms gain the initiative.', u'The capture of the strategically central city of Toledo in 1085 marked a significant shift in the balance of power in favour of the Christian kingdoms.', u'Following a great Muslim resurgence in the 12th century, the great Moorish strongholds in the south fell to Christian Spain in the 13th century\u2014C\xf3rdoba in 1236 and Seville in 1248.', u'The last Nasrid sultanate of Granada, a Muslim tributary state would finally surrender in 1492 to the Catholic monarchs Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon.', u'From the mid 13th century, literature and philosophy started to flourish again in the Christian peninsular kingdoms, based on Roman and Gothic traditions.', u'An important philosopher from this time is Ramon Llull.', u'Abraham Cresques was a prominent Jewish cartographer.', u'Roman law and its institutions were the model for the legislators.', u'The king Alfonso X of Castile focused on strengthening this Roman and Gothic past, and also on linking the Iberian Christian kingdoms with the rest of medieval European Christendom.', u'He worked for being elected emperor of the Holy Roman Empire and published the Siete Partidas code.', u'The Toledo School of Translators is the name that commonly describes the group of scholars who worked together in the city of Toledo during the 12th and 13th centuries, to translate many of the philosophical and scientific works from Classical Arabic, Ancient Greek, and Ancient Hebrew.', u'The Islamic transmission of the classics is the main Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe.', u'The Castilian language\u2014more commonly known (especially later in history and at present) as "Spanish" after becoming the national language and lingua franca of Spain\u2014evolved from Vulgar Latin, as did other Romance languages of Spain like the Catalan, Asturian and Galician languages, as well as other Romance languages in Latin Europe.', u'Basque, the only non-Romance language in Spain, continued evolving from Early Basque to Medieval.', u'The Glosas Emilianenses founded in the monasteries of San Mill\xe1n de la Cogolla contain the first written words in both Basque and Spanish, having the first become an influence in the formation of the second as an evolution of Latin.', u'In the 13th and 14th centuries, the Marinid Muslim sect based in North Africa invaded and established some enclaves on the southern coast but failed in their attempt to re-establish Muslim rule in Iberia and were soon driven out.', u"The 13th century also witnessed the Crown of Aragon, centred in Spain's north east, expand its reach across islands in the Mediterranean, to Sicily and even Athens.", u'Around this time the universities of Palencia (1212/1263) and Salamanca (1218/1254) were established.', u'The Black Death of 1348 and 1349 devastated Spain.', u'=== Imperial Spain ===\n\nIn 1469, the crowns of the Christian kingdoms of Castile and Aragon were united by the marriage of Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon.', u'1478 commenced the completion of the conquest of the Canary Islands and in 1492, the combined forces of Castile and Aragon captured the Emirate of Granada, ending the last remnant of a 781-year presence of Islamic rule in Iberia.', u"That same year, Spain's Jews were ordered to convert to Catholicism or face expulsion from Spanish territories during the Spanish Inquisition.", u'The Treaty of Granada guaranteed religious tolerance towards Muslims, and although the tolerance was only partial, it was not until the beginning of the 17th century, following the Revolt of the Alpujarras, that Muslims were finally expelled.', u'The year 1492 also marked the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the New World, during a voyage funded by Isabella.', u"Columbus's first voyage crossed the Atlantic and reached the Caribbean Islands, beginning the European exploration and conquest of the Americas, although he remained convinced that he had reached the Orient.", u'The colonisation of the Americas started, with conquistadores like Hern\xe1n Cort\xe9s and Francisco Pizarro.', u'Miscegenation was the rule between the native and the European cultures and people.', u'As Renaissance New Monarchs, Isabella and Ferdinand centralised royal power at the expense of local nobility, and the word Espa\xf1a, whose root is the ancient name Hispania, began to be commonly used to designate the whole of the two kingdoms.', u'With their wide-ranging political, legal, religious and military reforms, Spain emerged as the first world power.', u'The unification of the crowns of Aragon and Castile by the marriage of their sovereigns laid the basis for modern Spain and the Spanish Empire, although each kingdom of Spain remained a separate country, in social, political, laws, currency and language.', u'There were two big revolts against the new Habsburg monarch and the more authoritarian and imperial-style crown: Revolt of the Comuneros in Castile and Revolt of the Brotherhoods in Majorca and Valencia.', u'After years of combat, Comuneros Juan L\xf3pez de Padilla, Juan Bravo and Francisco Maldonado were executed and Mar\xeda Pacheco went into exile.', u'Germana de Foix also finished with the revolt in the Mediterranean.', u"Spain was Europe's leading power throughout the 16th century and most of the 17th century, a position reinforced by trade and wealth from colonial possessions and became the world's leading maritime power.", u'It reached its apogee during the reigns of the first two Spanish Habsburgs\u2014Charles I (1516\u20131556) and Philip II (1556\u20131598).', u'This period saw the Italian Wars, the Revolt of the Comuneros, the Dutch Revolt, the Morisco Revolt, clashes with the Ottomans, the Anglo-Spanish War and wars with France.', u'Through exploration and conquest or royal marriage alliances and inheritance, the Spanish Empire expanded to include vast areas in the Americas, islands in the Asia-Pacific area, areas of Italy, cities in Northern Africa, as well as parts of what are now France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands.', u'The first circumnavigation of the world was carried out in 1519\u20131521.', u'It was the first empire on which it was said that the sun never set.', u'This was an Age of Discovery, with daring explorations by sea and by land, the opening-up of new trade routes across oceans, conquests and the beginnings of European colonialism.', u'Spanish explorers brought back precious metals, spices, luxuries, and previously unknown plants, and played a leading part in transforming the European understanding of the globe.', u'The cultural efflorescence witnessed during this period is now referred to as the Spanish Golden Age.', u'The expansion of the empire caused immense upheaval in the Americas as the collapse of societies and empires and new diseases from Europe devastated American indigenous populations.', u'The rise of humanism, the Counter-Reformation and new geographical discoveries and conquests raised issues that were addressed by the intellectual movement now known as the School of Salamanca, which developed the first modern theories of what are now known as international law and human rights.', u'In the late 16th century and first half of the 17th century, Spain was confronted by unrelenting challenges from all sides.', u'Barbary pirates, under the aegis of the rapidly growing Ottoman Empire, disrupted life in many coastal areas through their slave raids and the renewed threat of an Islamic invasion.', u'This was at a time when Spain was often at war with France.', u'The Protestant Reformation dragged the kingdom ever more deeply into the mire of religiously charged wars.', u'The result was a country forced into ever expanding military efforts across Europe and in the Mediterranean.', u'By the middle decades of a war- and plague-ridden 17th-century Europe, the Spanish Habsburgs had enmeshed the country in continent-wide religious-political conflicts.', u'These conflicts drained it of resources and undermined the economy generally.', u"Spain managed to hold on to most of the scattered Habsburg empire, and help the imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire reverse a large part of the advances made by Protestant forces, but it was finally forced to recognise the separation of Portugal (with whom it had been united in a personal union of the crowns from 1580 to 1640) and the Netherlands, and eventually suffered some serious military reverses to France in the latter stages of the immensely destructive, Europe-wide Thirty Years' War.", u'In the latter half of the 17th century, Spain went into a gradual decline, during which it surrendered several small territories to France and the Netherlands; however, it maintained and enlarged its vast overseas empire, which remained intact until the beginning of the 19th century.', u'The decline culminated in a controversy over succession to the throne which consumed the first years of the 18th century.', u'The War of the Spanish Succession was a wide-ranging international conflict combined with a civil war, and was to cost the kingdom its European possessions and its position as one of the leading powers on the Continent.', u'During this war, a new dynasty originating in France, the Bourbons, was installed.', u'Long united only by the Crown, a true Spanish state was established when the first Bourbon king, Philip V, united the crowns of Castile and Aragon into a single state, abolishing many of the old regional privileges and laws.', u'The 18th century saw a gradual recovery and an increase in prosperity through much of the empire.', u'The new Bourbon monarchy drew on the French system of modernising the administration and the economy.', u"Enlightenment ideas began to gain ground among some of the kingdom's elite and monarchy.", u"Military assistance for the rebellious British colonies in the American War of Independence improved the kingdom's international standing.", u'=== Liberalism and nation state ===\n\nIn 1793, Spain went to war against the revolutionary new French Republic as a member of the first Coalition.', u'The subsequent War of the Pyrenees polarised the country in a reaction against the gallicised elites and following defeat in the field, peace was made with France in 1795 at the Peace of Basel in which Spain lost control over two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola.', u'The Prime Minister, Manuel Godoy, then ensured that Spain allied herself with France in the brief War of the Third Coalition which ended with the British victory at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.', u'In 1807, a secret treaty between Napoleon and the unpopular prime minister led to a new declaration of war against Britain and Portugal.', u"Napoleon's troops entered the country to invade Portugal but instead occupied Spain's major fortresses.", u"The ridiculed Spanish king abdicated in favour of Napoleon's brother, Joseph Bonaparte.", u'Joseph Bonaparte was seen as a puppet monarch and was regarded with scorn by the Spanish.', u'The 2 May 1808 revolt was one of many nationalist uprisings across the country against the Bonapartist regime.', u'These revolts marked the beginning of a devastating war of independence against the Napoleonic regime.', u'Napoleon was forced to intervene personally, defeating several Spanish armies and forcing a British army to retreat.', u"However, further military action by Spanish armies, guerrillas and Wellington's British-Portuguese forces, combined with Napoleon's disastrous invasion of Russia, led to the ousting of the French imperial armies from Spain in 1814, and the return of King Ferdinand VII.", u'During the war, in 1810, a revolutionary body, the Cortes of C\xe1diz, was assembled to co-ordinate the effort against the Bonapartist regime and to prepare a constitution.', u'It met as one body, and its members represented the entire Spanish empire.', u'In 1812 a constitution for universal representation under a constitutional monarchy was declared but after the fall of the Bonapartist regime Ferdinand VII dismissed the Cortes Generales and was determined to rule as an absolute monarch.', u'These events foreshadowed the conflict between conservatives and liberals in the 19th and early 20th centuries.', u"Spain's conquest by France benefited Latin American anti-colonialists who resented the Imperial Spanish government's policies that favoured Spanish-born citizens (Peninsulars) over those born overseas (Criollos) and demanded retroversion of the sovereignty to the people.", u"Starting in 1809 Spain's American colonies began a series of revolutions and declared independence, leading to the Spanish American wars of independence that ended Spanish control over its mainland colonies in the Americas.", u"King Ferdinand VII's attempt to re-assert control proved futile as he faced opposition not only in the colonies but also in Spain and army revolts followed, led by liberal officers.", u'By the end of 1826, the only American colonies Spain held were Cuba and Puerto Rico.', u'The Napoleonic War left Spain economically ruined, deeply divided and politically unstable.', u'In the 1830s and 1840s Anti-liberal forces known as Carlists fought against liberals in the Carlist Wars.', u'Liberal forces won, but the conflict between progressive and conservative liberals ended in a weak early constitutional period.', u'After the Glorious Revolution of 1868 and the short-lived First Spanish Republic, a more stable monarchic period began characterised by the practice of turnismo (the rotation of government control between progressive and conservative liberals within the Spanish government).', u'In the late 19th century nationalist movements arose in the Philippines and Cuba.', u'In 1895 and 1896 the Cuban War of Independence and the Philippine Revolution broke out and eventually the United States became involved.', u'The Spanish\u2013American War was fought in the spring of 1898 and resulted in Spain losing the last of its once vast colonial empire outside of North Africa.', u"El Desastre (the Disaster), as the war became known in Spain, gave added impetus to the Generation of '98 who were conducting an analysis of the country.", u'Although the period around the turn of the century was one of increasing prosperity, the 20th century brought little peace; Spain played a minor part in the scramble for Africa, with the colonisation of Western Sahara, Spanish Morocco and Equatorial Guinea.', u'It remained neutral during World War I (see Spain in World War I).', u'The heavy losses suffered during the Rif War in Morocco brought discredit to the government and undermined the monarchy.', u'A period of authoritarian rule under General Miguel Primo de Rivera (1923\u20131931) ended with the establishment of the Second Spanish Republic.', u'The Republic offered political autonomy to the linguistically distinct regions of Basque Country, Catalonia and Galicia and gave voting rights to women.', u'Clara Campoamor (suffragette leader), Victoria Kent or Dolores Ib\xe1rruri were some of the first female deputies and Federica Montseny one of the first female ministers in the world.', u'In the worsening economic situation of the Great Depression, Spanish politics became increasingly chaotic and violent.', u'=== Spanish Civil War and dictatorship ===\n\nThe Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936.', u'For three years the Nationalist forces led by General Francisco Franco and supported by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy fought the Republican side, which was supported by the Soviet Union, Mexico and International Brigades but it was not supported by the Western powers due to the British-led policy of Non-Intervention.', u'The civil war was viciously fought and there were many atrocities committed by all sides.', u'The war claimed the lives of over 500,000 people and caused the flight of up to a half-million citizens from the country.', u'In 1939, General Franco emerged victorious and became a dictator.', u'The state as established under Franco was nominally neutral in the Second World War, although sympathetic to the Axis.', u"The only legal party under Franco's post civil war regime was the Falange Espa\xf1ola Tradicionalista y de las JONS, formed in 1937; the party emphasised falangism, a form of fascism that emphasised anti-communism, nationalism and Roman Catholicism.", u"Given Franco's opposition to competing political parties, the party was renamed the National Movement (Movimiento Nacional) in 1949.", u'After World War II Spain was politically and economically isolated, and was kept out of the United Nations.', u'This changed in 1955, during the Cold War period, when it became strategically important for the US to establish a military presence on the Iberian Peninsula as a counter to any possible move by the Soviet Union into the Mediterranean basin.', u'In the 1960s, Spain registered an unprecedented rate of economic growth which was propelled by industrialisation, a mass internal migration from rural areas to cities and the creation of a mass tourism industry.', u"Franco's rule was also characterised by authoritarianism, promotion of a unitary national identity, the favouring of a very conservative form of Roman Catholicism known as National Catholicism, and discriminatory language policies.", u"In February 2016, the government of Spain announced it will rename streets named after Franco's administration officials with names of women.", u"=== Restoration of democracy ===\n\nIn 1962, Salvador de Madariaga, founder of the Liberal International and the College of Europe, met in the congress of the European Movement in Munich with members of the opposition to Franco's regime inside the country and in the exile.", u'There were 118 politicians from all factions.', u'At the end of the meetings a resolution in favour of democracy was made.', u"With Franco's death in November 1975, Juan Carlos succeeded to the position of King of Spain and head of state in accordance with the franquist law.", u'With the approval of the new Spanish Constitution of 1978 and the restoration of democracy, the State devolved much authority to the regions and created an internal organisation based on autonomous communities.', u'Spanish 1977 Amnesty Law let people of Franco\xb4s regime continue inside institutions without consequences, even responsibles of some crimes during transition to democracy like the Massacre of 3 March 1976 in Vitoria or 1977 Massacre of Atocha.', u'In the Basque Country, moderate Basque nationalism has coexisted with a radical nationalist movement led by the armed terrorist organisation ETA.', u"The group was formed in 1959 during Franco's rule but has continued to wage its violent campaign even after the restoration of democracy and the return of a large measure of regional autonomy.", u'On 23 February 1981, rebel elements among the security forces seized the Cortes in an attempt to impose a military backed government.', u'King Juan Carlos took personal command of the military and successfully ordered the coup plotters, via national television, to surrender.', u'During the 1980s the democratic restoration made possible a growing open society.', u'New cultural movements based on freedom appeared, like La Movida Madrile\xf1a and a culture of human rights arose with Gregorio Peces-Barba.', u'On 30 May 1982 Spain joined NATO, following a referendum after a strong social opposition.', u'That year the Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE) came to power, the first left-wing government in 43 years.', u'In 1986 Spain joined the European Economic Community, which later became the European Union.', u'The PSOE was replaced in government by the Partido Popular (PP) in 1996 after scandals around participation of the government of Felipe Gonz\xe1lez in the Dirty war against ETA; at that point the PSOE had served almost 14 consecutive years in office.', u'On 1 January 2002, Spain fully adopted the euro, and Spain experienced strong economic growth, well above the EU average during the early 2000s.', u'However, well publicised concerns issued by many economic commentators at the height of the boom warned that extraordinary property prices and a high foreign trade deficit were likely to lead to a painful economic collapse.', u'In 2002 Prestige oil spill happened with big ecological consequences in the Spanish atlantic coastline.', u'In 2003 Jos\xe9 Mar\xeda Aznar supported U.S. president George W. Bush in its preventive war against Sadam Hussein\xb4s Iraq.', u'A strong movement against war rose in Spanish society.', u'On 11 March 2004 a local Islamist terrorist group inspired by Al-Qaeda carried out the largest terrorist attack in Spanish history when they killed 191 people and wounded more than 1,800 others by bombing commuter trains in Madrid.', u'Though initial suspicions focused on the Basque terrorist group ETA, evidence soon emerged indicating Islamist involvement.', u'Because of the proximity of the 2004 election, the issue of responsibility quickly became a political controversy, with the main competing parties PP and PSOE exchanging accusations over the handling of the incident.', u'At 14 March elections, PSOE, led by Jos\xe9 Luis Rodr\xedguez Zapatero won the elections.', u"The proportion of Spain's foreign born population increased rapidly from around 1 in 50 in 2000 to almost 1 in 8 in 2010 but has since declined.", u'In 2005 the Spanish government legalised same sex marriage.', u'Decentralatation was supported with much resistance of Constitutional Court and conservative opposition, so did gender politics like cuotas or the law against gender violence.', u'Government talks with ETA happened, and the band announced its permanent cease of violence in 2010.', u"The bursting of the Spanish property bubble in 2008 led to the 2008\u201315 Spanish financial crisis and high levels of unemployment, cuts in government spending and corruption in Royal family and People's Party served as a backdrop to the 2011\u201312 Spanish protests.", u'Catalan independentism was also on rise.', u"In 2011 Mariano Rajoy's conservative People's Party won elections with 44.6% of votes and Rajoy became the Spanish Prime Minister after having been the leader of the opposition from 2004 to 2011 with a program of cutting social spends.", u'On 19 June 2014, the monarch, Juan Carlos, abdicated in favour of his son, who became Felipe VI.', u'Bipartidism in Spanish politcs got to an end with the entrance of new forces in representative institutions.', u'In 2015, left-wing mayors got control of biggest cities in the country as former judge and former co-founder of the labor law office where the 1977 Massacre of Atocha took place Manuela Carmena in Madrid, cofounder and spokesperson of the Platform for People Affected by Mortgages Ada Colau in Barcelona, Valencia or Zaragoza, the first time that happens since the Spanish Second Republic.', u"Even though, in general election of the same year, conservative People's Party revalidated its majority in the parliament.", u"== Geography ==\n\nAt 505,992 km2 (195,365 sq mi), Spain is the world's fifty-second largest country and Europe's fourth largest country.", u'It is some 47,000 km2 (18,000 sq mi) smaller than France and 81,000 km2 (31,000 sq mi) larger than the US state of California.', u'Mount Teide (Tenerife) is the highest mountain peak in Spain and is the third largest volcano in the world from its base.', u'Spain lies between latitudes 26\xb0 and 44\xb0 N, and longitudes 19\xb0 W and 5\xb0 E.\nOn the west, Spain is bordered by Portugal; on the south, it is bordered by Gibraltar (a British overseas territory) and Morocco, through its exclaves in North Africa (Ceuta and Melilla, and the peninsula of V\xe9lez de la Gomera).', u'On the northeast, along the Pyrenees mountain range, it is bordered by France and the Principality of Andorra.', u'Along the Pyrenees in Girona, a small exclave town called Ll\xedvia is surrounded by France.', u'Extending to 1,214 km (754 mi), the Portugal\u2013Spain border is the longest uninterrupted border within the European Union.', u'=== Islands ===\n\nSpain also includes the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea, the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean and a number of uninhabited islands on the Mediterranean side of the Strait of Gibraltar, known as plazas de soberan\xeda ("places of sovereignty", or territories under [Spanish] sovereignty), such as the Chafarinas Islands and Alhucemas.', u'The peninsula of V\xe9lez de la Gomera is also regarded as a plaza de soberan\xeda.', u'The isle of Albor\xe1n, located in the Mediterranean between Spain and North Africa, is also administered by Spain, specifically by the municipality of Almer\xeda, Andalusia.', u'The little Pheasant Island in the River Bidasoa is a Spanish-French condominium.', u'Largest inhabited islands of Spain:\n\n\n=== Mountains and rivers ===\n\nMainland Spain is a mountainous country, dominated by high plateaus and mountain chains.', u'After the Pyrenees, the main mountain ranges are the Cordillera Cant\xe1brica (Cantabrian Range), Sistema Ib\xe9rico (Iberian System), Sistema Central (Central System), Montes de Toledo, Sierra Morena and the Sistema B\xe9tico (Baetic System) whose highest peak, the 3,478 metres (11,411 ft) Mulhac\xe9n, located in Sierra Nevada, is the highest elevation in the Iberian Peninsula.', u'The highest point in Spain is the Teide, a 3,718-metre (12,198 ft) active volcano in the Canary Islands.', u'The Meseta Central (often translated as "Inner Plateau") is a vast plateau in the heart of peninsular Spain.', u'There are several major rivers in Spain such as the Tagus (Tajo), Ebro, Guadiana, Douro (Duero), Guadalquivir, J\xfacar, Segura, Turia and Minho (Mi\xf1o).', u'Alluvial plains are found along the coast, the largest of which is that of the Guadalquivir in Andalusia.', u'=== Climate ===\n\nThree main climatic zones can be separated, according to geographical situation and orographic conditions:\nThe Mediterranean climate, characterised by warm/hot and dry summers, is dominant in the peninsula.', u'It has two varieties: Csa and Csb according to the K\xf6ppen climate classification.', u'The Csa zone is associated to areas with hot summers.', u'It is predominant in the Mediterranean and Southern Atlantic coast and inland throughout Andalusia, Extremadura and much, if not most, of the center of the country.', u'The Csa zone covers climatic zones with both relatively warm and cold winters which are considered extremely different to each other at a local level, reason for which K\xf6ppen classification is often eschewed within Spain.', u'Local climatic maps generally divide the Mediterranean zone (which covers most of the country) between warm-winter and cold-winter zones, rather than according to summer temperatures.', u'The Csb zone has warm rather than hot summers, and extends to additional cool-winter areas not typically associated with a Mediterranean climate, such as much of central and northern-central of Spain (e.g.', u'western Castile\u2013Le\xf3n, northeastern Castilla-La Mancha and northern Madrid) and into much rainier areas (notably Galicia).', u'Note areas with relatively high rainfall such as Galicia are not considered Mediterranean under local classifications, but classed as oceanic.', u'The semi-arid climate (BSk, BSh), is predominant in the southeastern quarter of the country, but is also widespread in other areas of Spain.', u'It covers most of the Region of Murcia, southern Valencia and eastern Andalusia, where true hot desert climates also exist.', u'Further to the north, it is predominant in the upper and mid reaches of the Ebro valley, which crosses southern Navarre, central Aragon and western Catalonia.', u'It also is found in Madrid, Extremadura, Castilla-La Mancha, and some locations of western Andalusia.', u'The dry season extends beyond the summer and average temperature depends on altitude and latitude.', u'The oceanic climate (Cfb), located in the northern quarter of the country, especially in the Atlantic region (Basque Country, Cantabria, Asturias, and partly Galicia and Castile\u2013Le\xf3n).', u'Additionally it is also found in northern Navarre, in most highlands areas along the Iberian System and in the Pyrenean valleys, where a humid subtropical variant (Cfa) also occurs.', u'Winter and summer temperatures are influenced by the ocean, and have no seasonal drought.', u'Apart from these main types, other sub-types can be found, like the alpine and continental climate (Dfc, Dfb / Dsc, Dsb) in the Pyrenees as well as parts of the Cantabrian Range, the Central System, Sierra Nevada and the Iberian System, and a typical desert climate (BWk, BWh) in the zone of Almer\xeda, Murcia and eastern Canary Islands.', u'Low-lying areas of the Canary Islands average above 18.0 \xb0C (64.4 \xb0F) during their coldest month, thus having a tropical climate.', u'The below-listed list covers the average temperatures of the largest cities in four different parts of Spain; Madrid (central peninsula), Barcelona (Mediterranean coast), Bilbao (north coast) and C\xe1diz (south Atlantic coast).', u'Santa Cruz de Tenerife which has a significantly different climates to the predominant climate in Spain.', u'More information regarding temperature can be found in city articles and the main article about the Spanish climate.', u'=== Fauna and flora ===\n\nThe fauna presents a wide diversity that is due in large part to the geographical position of the Iberian peninsula between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean and between Africa and Eurasia, and the great diversity of habitats and biotopes, the result of a considerable variety of climates and well differentiated regions.', u'The vegetation of Spain is varied due to several factors including the diversity of the relief, the climate and latitude.', u'Spain includes different phytogeographic regions, each with its own floristic characteristics resulting largely from the interaction of climate, topography, soil type and fire, biotic factors.', u'== Politics ==\n\nAccording to the Democracy Index of the EIU, Spain is one of the 20 full democracies in the world.', u'The Spanish Constitution of 1978 is the culmination of the Spanish transition to democracy.', u'The constitutional history of Spain dates back to the constitution of 1812.', u"Impatient with the slow pace of democratic political reforms in 1976 and 1977, Spain's new King Juan Carlos, known for his formidable personality, dismissed Carlos Arias Navarro and appointed the reformer Adolfo Su\xe1rez as Prime Minister.", u'The resulting general election in 1977 convened the Constituent Cortes (the Spanish Parliament, in its capacity as a constitutional assembly) for the purpose of drafting and approving the constitution of 1978.', u'After a national referendum on 6 December 1978, 88% of voters approved of the new constitution.', u'As a result, Spain is now composed of 17 autonomous communities and two autonomous cities with varying degrees of autonomy thanks to its Constitution, which nevertheless explicitly states the indivisible unity of the Spanish nation.', u'The constitution also specifies that Spain has no state religion and that all are free to practice and believe as they wish.', u'The Spanish administration approved legislation in 2007 aimed at furthering equality between genders in Spanish political and economic life (Gender Equality Act).', u'However, in the legislative branch, as of July 2010 only 128 of the 350 members of the Congress were women (36.3%).', u'It places Spain 13th on a list of countries ranked by proportion of women in the lower house.', u'In the Senate, the ratio is even lower, since there are only 79 women out of 263 (30.0%).', u'The Gender Empowerment Measure of Spain in the United Nations Human Development Report is 0.794, 12th in the world.', u'=== Government ===\n\nSpain is a constitutional monarchy, with a hereditary monarch and a bicameral parliament, the Cortes Generales (General Courts).', u'The executive branch consists of a Council of Ministers of Spain presided over by the Prime Minister, nominated and appointed by the monarch and confirmed by the Congress of Deputies following legislative elections.', u"By political custom established by King Juan Carlos since the ratification of the 1978 Constitution, the king's nominees have all been from parties who maintain a plurality of seats in the Congress.", u'The legislative branch is made up of the Congress of Deputies (Congreso de los Diputados) with 350 members, elected by popular vote on block lists by proportional representation to serve four-year terms, and a Senate (Senado) with 259 seats of which 208 are directly elected by popular vote and the other 51 appointed by the regional legislatures to also serve four-year terms.', u'Head of State\nKing Felipe VI, since 19 June 2014\n\nHead of Government\nPrime Minister of Spain (Presidente del Gobierno, literally President of the Government): Mariano Rajoy Brey, elected 20 November 2011.', u'Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for the Presidency: Soraya S\xe1enz de Santamar\xeda.', u'Cabinet\nCouncil of Ministers (Consejo de Ministros) designated by the Prime Minister.', u'Spain is organisationally structured as a so-called Estado de las Autonom\xedas ("State of Autonomies"); it is one of the most decentralised countries in Europe, along with Switzerland, Germany and Belgium; for example, all autonomous communities have their own elected parliaments, governments, public administrations, budgets, and resources.', u'Health and education systems among others are managed regionally, and in addition, the Basque Country and Navarre also manage their own public finances based on foral provisions.', u"In Catalonia, the Basque Country, Navarre and the Canary Islands, a full-fledged autonomous police corps replaces some of the State police functions (see Mossos d'Esquadra, Ertzaintza, Polic\xeda Foral and Polic\xeda Canaria).", u'=== Human rights ===\n\nThe Government respects the human rights of its citizens; although there are a few problems in some areas, the law and judiciary provide effective means of addressing individual instances of abuse.', u'There are allegations that a few members of the security forces abused detainees and mistreated foreigners and illegal immigrants.', u'According to Amnesty International (AI), government investigations of such alleged abuses are often lengthy and punishments were light.', u'Violence against women was a problem, which the Government took steps to address.', u'Spain provides one of the highest degrees of liberty in the world for its LGBT community.', u'Among the countries studied by Pew Research Center in 2013, Spain is rated first in acceptance of homosexuality, with an 88% of society supporting the gay community compared to 11% who do not.', u'=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nThe Spanish State is integrated by 17 autonomous communities and 2 autonomous cities, both groups being the highest or first-order administrative division in the country.', u'Autonomous communities are integrated by provinces, of which there are 50 in total, and in turn, provinces are integrated by municipalities.', u'In Catalonia, two additional divisions exist, the comarques (sing.', u'comarca) and the vegueries (sing.', u'vegueria) both of which have administrative powers; comarques being aggregations of municipalities, and the vegueries being aggregations of comarques.', u'The concept of a comarca exists in all autonomous communities, however, unlike Catalonia, these are merely historical or geographical subdivisions.', u"==== Autonomous communities ====\n\nSpain's autonomous communities are the first level administrative divisions of the country.", u'They were created after the current constitution came into effect (in 1978) in recognition of the right to self-government of the "nationalities and regions of Spain".', u'The autonomous communities were to be integrated into adjacent provinces with common historical, cultural, and economical traits.', u'This territorial organisation, based on devolution, is literally known in Spain as the "State of Autonomies".', u'The basic institutional law of each autonomous community is the Statute of Autonomy.', u'The Statutes of Autonomy establish the name of the community according to its historical and contemporary identity, the limits of its territories, the name and organisation of the institutions of government and the rights they enjoy according to the constitution.', u'The governments of all autonomous communities must be based on a division of powers comprising:\na legislative assembly whose members must be elected by universal suffrage according to the system of proportional representation and in which all areas that integrate the territory are fairly represented;\na government council, with executive and administrative functions headed by a president, elected by the Legislative Assembly and nominated by the King of Spain;\na supreme court, under the supreme court of Spain, which heads the judiciary in the autonomous community.', u'Catalonia, Galicia and the Basque Country, which identified themselves as nationalities were granted self-government through a rapid process.', u'Andalusia also took that denomination in its first Statute of Autonomy, even though it followed the longer process stipulated in the constitution for the rest of the country.', u'Progressively, other communities in revisions to their Statutes of Autonomy have also taken that denomination in accordance to their historical and modern identities, such as the Valencian Community, the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands, and Aragon.', u'The autonomous communities have wide legislative and executive autonomy, with their own parliaments and regional governments.', u'The distribution of powers may be different for every community, as laid out in their Statutes of Autonomy, since devolution was intended to be asymmetrical.', u'Only two communities\u2014the Basque Country and Navarre\u2014have full fiscal autonomy.', u'Aside of fiscal autonomy, the nationalities\u2014Andalusia, the Basque Country, Catalonia, and Galicia\u2014were devolved more powers than the rest of the communities, among them the ability of the regional president to dissolve the parliament and call for elections at any time.', u"In addition, the Basque Country, Catalonia and Navarre have police corps of their own: Ertzaintza, Mossos d'Esquadra and the Polic\xeda Foral respectively.", u'Other communities have more limited forces or none at all, like the Polic\xeda Aut\xf3noma Andaluza in Andalusia or the BESCAM in Madrid.', u'Nonetheless, recent amendments to existing Statutes of Autonomy or the promulgation of new Statutes altogether, have reduced the asymmetry between the powers originally granted to the nationalities and the rest of the regions.', u'Finally, along with the 17 autonomous communities, two autonomous cities are also part of the State of Autonomies and are first-order territorial divisions: Ceuta and Melilla.', u'These are two exclaves located in the northern African coast.', u'==== Provinces and municipalities ====\n\nAutonomous communities are subdivided into provinces, which served as their territorial building blocks.', u'In turn, provinces are integrated by municipalities.', u'The existence of both the provinces and the municipalities is guaranteed and protected by the constitution, not necessarily by the Statutes of Autonomy themselves.', u'Municipalities are granted autonomy to manage their internal affairs, and provinces are the territorial divisions designed to carry out the activities of the State.', u'The current provincial division structure is based\u2014with minor changes\u2014on the 1833 territorial division by Javier de Burgos, and in all, the Spanish territory is divided into 50 provinces.', u'The communities of Asturias, Cantabria, La Rioja, the Balearic Islands, Madrid, Murcia and Navarre are the only communities that are integrated by a single province, which is coextensive with the community itself.', u'In these cases, the administrative institutions of the province are replaced by the governmental institutions of the community.', u"=== Foreign relations ===\n\nAfter the return of democracy following the death of Franco in 1975, Spain's foreign policy priorities were to break out of the diplomatic isolation of the Franco years and expand diplomatic relations, enter the European Community, and define security relations with the West.", u'As a member of NATO since 1982, Spain has established itself as a participant in multilateral international security activities.', u"Spain's EU membership represents an important part of its foreign policy.", u'Even on many international issues beyond western Europe, Spain prefers to co-ordinate its efforts with its EU partners through the European political co-operation mechanisms.', u'Spain has maintained its special relations with Hispanic America and the Philippines.', u'Its policy emphasises the concept of an Ibero-American community, essentially the renewal of the historically liberal concept of "Hispanidad" or "Hispanismo", as it is often referred to in English, which has sought to link the Iberian Peninsula with Hispanic America through language, commerce, history and culture.', u'Territorial disputes\nSpain claims Gibraltar, a 6-square-kilometre (2.3 sq mi) Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom in the southernmost part of the Iberian Peninsula.', u'Then a Spanish town, it was conquered by an Anglo-Dutch force in 1704 during the War of the Spanish Succession on behalf of Archduke Charles, pretender to the Spanish throne.', u'The legal situation concerning Gibraltar was settled in 1713 by the Treaty of Utrecht, in which Spain ceded the territory in perpetuity to the British Crown stating that, should the British abandon this post, it would be offered to Spain first.', u'Since the 1940s Spain has called for the return of Gibraltar.', u'The overwhelming majority of Gibraltarians strongly oppose this, along with any proposal of shared sovereignty.', u'UN resolutions call on the United Kingdom and Spain, both EU members, to reach an agreement over the status of Gibraltar.', u'The Spanish claim makes a distinction between the isthmus that connects the Rock to the Spanish mainland on the one hand, and the Rock and city of Gibraltar on the other.', u'While the Rock and city were ceded by the Treaty of Utrecht, Spain asserts that the "occupation of the isthmus is illegal and against the principles of International Law".', u'The United Kingdom relies on de facto arguments of possession by prescription in relation to the isthmus, as there has been "continuous possession [of the isthmus] over a long period".', u'Another claim by Spain is about the Savage Islands, a claim not recognised by Portugal.', u'Spain claims that they are rocks rather than islands, therefore claiming that there is no Portuguese territorial waters around the disputed islands.', u'On 5 July 2013, Spain sent a letter to the UN expressing these views.', u'Spain claims the sovereignty over the Perejil Island, a small, uninhabited rocky islet located in the South shore of the Strait of Gibraltar.', u'The island lies 250 metres (820 ft) just off the coast of Morocco, 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) from Ceuta and 13.5 kilometres (8.4 mi) from mainland Spain.', u'Its sovereignty is disputed between Spain and Morocco.', u'It was the subject of an armed incident between the two countries in 2002.', u'The incident ended when both countries agreed to return to the status quo ante which existed prior to the Moroccan occupation of the island.', u'The islet is now deserted and without any sign of sovereignty.', u"Besides the Perejil Island, the Spanish-held territories claimed by other countries are two: Morocco claims the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla and the plazas de soberan\xeda islets off the northern coast of Africa; and Portugal does not recognise Spain's sovereignty over the territory of Olivenza.", u'=== Military ===\n\nThe armed forces of Spain are known as the Spanish Armed Forces (Fuerzas Armadas Espa\xf1olas).', u'Their Commander-in-chief is the King of Spain, Felipe VI.', u"The Spanish Armed Forces are divided into three branches:\nArmy (Ej\xe9rcito de Tierra)\nNavy (Armada)\nAir Force (Ej\xe9rcito del Aire)\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nSpain's capitalist mixed economy is the 16th largest worldwide and the 5th largest in the European Union, as well as the Eurozone's 4th largest.", u'The centre-right government of former prime minister Jos\xe9 Mar\xeda Aznar worked successfully to gain admission to the group of countries launching the euro in 1999.', u'Unemployment stood at 7.6% in October 2006, a rate that compared favourably to many other European countries, and especially with the early 1990s when it stood at over 20%.', u"Perennial weak points of Spain's economy include high inflation, a large underground economy, and an education system which OECD reports place among the poorest for developed countries, together with the United States and UK.", u'By the mid-1990s the economy had recommenced the growth that had been disrupted by the global recession of the early 1990s.', u"The strong economic growth helped the government to reduce the government debt as a percentage of GDP and Spain's high unemployment began to drop steadily.", u'With the government budget in balance and inflation under control Spain was admitted into the Eurozone in 1999.', u'Since the 1990s some Spanish companies have gained multinational status, often expanding their activities in culturally close Latin America.', u'Spain is the second biggest foreign investor there, after the United States.', u'Spanish companies have also expanded into Asia, especially China and India.', u'This early global expansion is a competitive advantage over its competitors and European neighbours.', u'The reason for this early expansion is the booming interest towards Spanish language and culture in Asia and Africa and a corporate culture that learned to take risks in unstable markets.', u"Spanish companies invested in fields like renewable energy commercialisation (Iberdrola was the world's largest renewable energy operator), technology companies like Telef\xf3nica, Abengoa, Mondragon Corporation, Movistar, Hisdesat, Indra, train manufacturers like CAF, Talgo, global corporations such as the textile company Inditex, petroleum companies like Repsol and infrastructure, with six of the ten biggest international construction firms specialising in transport being Spanish, like Ferrovial, Acciona, ACS, OHL and FCC.", u"In 2005 the Economist Intelligence Unit's quality of life survey placed Spain among the top 10 in the world.", u'In 2013 the same survey (now called the "Where-to-be-born index"), ranked Spain 28th in the world.', u'In 2010, the Basque city of Bilbao was awarded with the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize, and its mayor at the time, I\xf1aki Azkuna, was awarded the World Mayor Prize in 2012.', u'The Basque capital city of Vitoria-Gasteiz received the European Green Capital Award in 2012.', u'=== Agriculture ===\n\nCrop areas were farmed in two highly diverse manners.', u'Areas relying on non-irrigated cultivation (secano), which made up 85% of the entire crop area, depended solely on rainfall as a source of water.', u'They included the humid regions of the north and the northwest, as well as vast arid zones that had not been irrigated.', u'The much more productive regions devoted to irrigated cultivation (regad\xedo) accounted for 3 million hectares in 1986, and the government hoped that this area would eventually double, as it already had doubled since 1950.', u'Particularly noteworthy was the development in Almer\xeda\u2014one of the most arid and desolate provinces of Spain\u2014of winter crops of various fruits and vegetables for export to Europe.', u"Though only about 17% of Spain's cultivated land was irrigated, it was estimated to be the source of between 40\u201345% of the gross value of crop production and of 50% of the value of agricultural exports.", u'More than half of the irrigated area was planted in corn, fruit trees, and vegetables.', u'Other agricultural products that benefited from irrigation included grapes, cotton, sugar beets, potatoes, legumes, olive trees, mangos, strawberries, tomatoes, and fodder grasses.', u"Depending on the nature of the crop, it was possible to harvest two successive crops in the same year on about 10% of the country's irrigated land.", u"Citrus fruits, vegetables, cereal grains, olive oil, and wine\u2014Spain's traditional agricultural products\u2014continued to be important in the 1980s.", u"In 1983 they represented 12%, 12%, 8%, 6%, and 4%, respectively, of the country's agricultural production.", u'Because of the changed diet of an increasingly affluent population, there was a notable increase in the consumption of livestock, poultry, and dairy products.', u'Meat production for domestic consumption became the single most important agricultural activity, accounting for 30% of all farm-related production in 1983.', u'Increased attention to livestock was the reason that Spain became a net importer of grains.', u"Ideal growing conditions, combined with proximity to important north European markets, made citrus fruits Spain's leading export.", u'Fresh vegetables and fruits produced through intensive irrigation farming also became important export commodities, as did sunflower seed oil that was produced to compete with the more expensive olive oils in oversupply throughout the Mediterranean countries of the EC.', u"=== Tourism ===\n\nThe climate of Spain, its geographic location, popular coastlines, diverse landscapes, historical legacy, vibrant culture and excellent infrastructure, has made Spain's international tourist industry among the largest in the world.", u'In the last five decades, international tourism in Spain has grown to become the second largest in the world in terms of spending, worth approximately 40 billion Euros or about 5% of GDP in 2006.', u"=== Energy ===\n\nSpain is one of the world's leading countries in the development and production of renewable energy.", u'In 2010 Spain became the solar power world leader when it overtook the United States with a massive power station plant called La Florida, near Alvarado, Badajoz.', u"Spain is also Europe's main producer of wind energy.", u'In 2010 its wind turbines generated 42,976 GWh, which accounted for 16.4% of all electrical energy produced in Spain.', u'On 9 November 2010, wind energy reached an instantaneous historic peak covering 53% of mainland electricity demand and generating an amount of energy that is equivalent to that of 14 nuclear reactors.', u'Other renewable energies used in Spain are hydroelectric, biomass and marine (2 power plants under construction).', u'Non-renewable energy sources used in Spain are nuclear (8 operative reactors), gas, coal, and oil.', u"Fossil fuels together generated 58% of Spain's electricity in 2009, just below the OECD mean of 61%.", u'Nuclear power generated another 19%, and wind and hydro about 12% each.', u'=== Transport ===\n\nThe Spanish road system is mainly centralised, with six highways connecting Madrid to the Basque Country, Catalonia, Valencia, West Andalusia, Extremadura and Galicia.', u'Additionally, there are highways along the Atlantic (Ferrol to Vigo), Cantabrian (Oviedo to San Sebasti\xe1n) and Mediterranean (Girona to C\xe1diz) coasts.', u"Spain aims to put one million electric cars on the road by 2014 as part of the government's plan to save energy and boost energy efficiency.", u'The former Minister of Industry Miguel Sebasti\xe1n said that "the electric vehicle is the future and the engine of an industrial revolution."', u'Spain has the most extensive high-speed rail network in Europe, and the second-most extensive in the world after China.', u'As of October 2010, Spain has a total of 3,500 km (2,174.80 mi) of high-speed tracks linking M\xe1laga, Seville, Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia and Valladolid, with the trains reaching speeds up to 300 km/h (190 mph).', u'On average, the Spanish high-speed train is the fastest one in the world, followed by the Japanese bullet train and the French TGV.', u'Regarding punctuality, it is second in the world (98.54% on-time arrival) after the Japanese Shinkansen (99%).', u'Should the aims of the ambitious AVE programme (Spanish high speed trains) be met, by 2020 Spain will have 7,000 km (4,300 mi) of high-speed trains linking almost all provincial cities to Madrid in less than three hours and Barcelona within four hours.', u'There are 47 public airports in Spain.', u"The busiest one is the airport of Madrid (Barajas), with 50 million passengers in 2011, being the world's 15th busiest airport, as well as the European Union's fourth busiest.", u"The airport of Barcelona (El Prat) is also important, with 35 million passengers in 2011, being the world's 31st-busiest airport.", u'Other main airports are located in Majorca (23 million passengers), M\xe1laga (13 million passengers), Las Palmas (Gran Canaria) (11 million passengers), Alicante (10 million passengers) and smaller, with the number of passengers between 4 and 10 million, for example Tenerife (two airports), Valencia, Seville, Bilbao, Ibiza, Lanzarote, Fuerteventura.', u'Also, more than 30 airports with the number of passengers below 4 million.', u'=== Science and technology ===\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries science in Spain was held back by severe political instability and consequent economic underdevelopment.', u'Despite the conditions, some important scientists and engineers emerged.', u'The most notable were Miguel Servet, Santiago Ram\xf3n y Cajal, Narc\xeds Monturiol, Celedonio Calatayud, Juan de la Cierva, Leonardo Torres y Quevedo, Margarita Salas and Severo Ochoa.', u"See also ASCAMM, Associaci\xf3 Catalana d'Empreses constructores de Motlles i Matrius\n\n\n=== Water supply and sanitation ===\n\nWater supply and Sanitation in Spain is characterised by universal access and generally good service quality, while tariffs are among the lowest in the EU.", u'Almost half of the population is served by private or mixed private-public water companies, which operate under concession contracts with municipalities.', u'The largest of the private water companies, with a market share of about 50% of the private concessions, is Aguas de Barcelona (Agbar).', u'However, the large cities are all served by public companies except Barcelona and Valencia.', u'The largest public company is Canal de Isabel II, which serves the metropolitan area of Madrid.', u'Droughts affect water supply in Southern Spain, which increasingly is turning towards seawater desalination to meet its water needs.', u"== Demographics ==\n\nIn 2008 the population of Spain officially reached 46 million people, as recorded by the Padr\xf3n municipal (Spain's Municipal Register).", u"Spain's population density, at 91/km\xb2 (235/sq mi), is lower than that of most Western European countries and its distribution across the country is very unequal.", u'With the exception of the region surrounding the capital, Madrid, the most populated areas lie around the coast.', u'The population of Spain more than doubled since 1900, when it stood at 18.6 million, principally due to the spectacular demographic boom in the 1960s and early 1970s.', u'Native Spaniards make up 88% of the total population of Spain.', u"After the birth rate plunged in the 1980s and Spain's population growth rate dropped, the population again trended upward, based initially on the return of many Spaniards who had emigrated to other European countries during the 1970s, and more recently, fuelled by large numbers of immigrants who make up 12% of the population.", u'The immigrants originate mainly in Latin America (39%), North Africa (16%), Eastern Europe (15%), and Sub-Saharan Africa (4%).', u'In 2005, Spain instituted a three-month amnesty programme through which certain hitherto undocumented aliens were granted legal residency.', u'In 2008, Spain granted citizenship to 84,170 persons, mostly to people from Ecuador, Colombia and Morocco.', u'A sizeable portion of foreign residents in Spain also comes from other Western and Central European countries.', u'These are mostly British, French, German, Dutch, and Norwegian.', u'They reside primarily on the Mediterranean coast and the Balearic islands, where many choose to live their retirement or telecommute.', u'Substantial populations descended from Spanish colonists and immigrants exist in other parts of the world, most notably in Latin America.', u"Beginning in the late 15th century, large numbers of Iberian colonists settled in what became Latin America and at present most white Latin Americans (who make up about one-third of Latin America's population) are of Spanish or Portuguese origin.", u'Around 240,000 Spaniards emigrated in the 16th century, mostly to Peru and Mexico.', u'Another 450,000 left in the 17th century.', u'Between 1846 and 1932 it is estimated that nearly 5 million Spaniards emigrated to the Americas, especially to Argentina and Brazil.', u'Approximately two million Spaniards migrated to other Western European countries between 1960 and 1975.', u'During the same period perhaps 300,000 went to Latin America.', u'== Urbanisation ==\nMetropolitan areas\n\nSource: "\xc1reas urbanas +50", Ministry of Public Works and Transport (2013)\n\n\n=== Peoples ===\n\nThe Spanish Constitution of 1978, in its second article, recognises contemporary entities\u2014nationalities (a carefully chosen word to avoid the more politically charged "nations")\u2014and regions, within the context of the Spanish nation.', u"For some people, Spain's identity consists more of an overlap of different territorial and ethnolinguistic identities than of a sole Spanish identity.", u'Indeed, some of the territorial identities may even conflict with the Spanish one.', u'Distinct traditional identities within Spain include the Basques, Catalans, Galicians, Andalusians and Valencians, although to some extent all of the 17 autonomous communities will claim a distinct local identity.', u'It is this last feature of "shared identity" between the more local level or autonomous community and the Spanish level which makes the identity question in Spain complex and far from univocal.', u'=== Minority groups ===\nSpain has a number of descendants of populations from former colonies, especially Latin America and North Africa.', u'Smaller numbers of immigrants from several Sub-Saharan countries have recently been settling in Spain.', u'There are also sizeable numbers of Asian immigrants, most of whom are of Middle Eastern, South Asian and Chinese origin.', u'The single largest group of immigrants are European; represented by large numbers of Romanians, Britons, Germans, French and others.', u'The arrival of the gitanos, a Romani people, began in the 16th century; estimates of the Spanish Roma population range from 750,000 to over one million.', u'There are also the mercheros (also quinquis), a formerly nomadic minority group.', u'Their origin is unclear.', u'Historically, Sephardi Jews and Moriscos are the main minority groups originated in Spain and with a contribution to Spanish culture.', u'The Spanish government is offering Spanish nationality to sephardi Jews.', u'=== Immigration ===\n\nAccording to the Spanish government there were 5.7 million foreign residents in Spain in 2011, or 12% of the total population.', u'According to residence permit data for 2011, more than 860,000 were Romanian, about 770,000 were Moroccan, approximately 390,000 were British, and 360,000 were Ecuadorian.', u'Other sizeable foreign communities are Colombian, Bolivian, German, Italian, Bulgarian, and Chinese.', u'There are more than 200,000 migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa living in Spain, principally Senegaleses and Nigerians.', u'Since 2000, Spain has experienced high population growth as a result of immigration flows, despite a birth rate that is only half the replacement level.', u'This sudden and ongoing inflow of immigrants, particularly those arriving illegally by sea, has caused noticeable social tension.', u'Within the EU, Spain had the 2nd highest immigration rate in percentage terms after Cyprus, but by a great margin, the highest in absolute numbers, up to 2008.', u'The number of immigrants in Spain had grown up from 500,000 people in 1996 to 5.2 million in 2008 out of a total population of 46 million.', u'In 2005 alone, a regularisation programme increased the legal immigrant population by 700,000 people.', u"There are a number of reasons for the high level of immigration, including Spain's cultural ties with Latin America, its geographical position, the porosity of its borders, the large size of its underground economy and the strength of the agricultural and construction sectors, which demand more low cost labour than can be offered by the national workforce.", u"Another statistically significant factor is the large number of residents of EU origin typically retiring to Spain's Mediterranean coast.", u"In fact, Spain was Europe's largest absorber of migrants from 2002 to 2007, with its immigrant population more than doubling as 2.5 million people arrived.", u'In 2008, prior to the onset of the economic crisis, the Financial Times reported that Spain was the most favoured destination for Western Europeans considering a move from their own country and seeking jobs elsewhere in the EU.', u'In 2008, the government instituted a "Plan of Voluntary Return" which encouraged unemployed immigrants from outside the EU to return to their home countries and receive several incentives, including the right to keep their unemployment benefits and transfer whatever they contributed to the Spanish Social Security.', u'The programme had little effect; during its first two months, just 1,400 immigrants took up the offer.', u'What the programme failed to do, the sharp and prolonged economic crisis has done from 2010 to 2011 in that tens of thousands of immigrants have left the country due to lack of jobs.', u'In 2011 alone, more than half a million people left Spain.', u'For the first time in decades the net migration rate was expected to be negative, and nine out of 10 emigrants were foreigners.', u'=== Languages ===\n\nSpain is openly multilingual, and the constitution establishes that the nation will protect "all Spaniards and the peoples of Spain in the exercise of human rights, their cultures and traditions, languages and institutions.', u'Spanish (espa\xf1ol)\u2014officially recognised in the constitution as Castilian (castellano)\u2014is the official language of the entire country, and it is the right and duty of every Spaniard to know the language.', u'The constitution also establishes that "all other Spanish languages"\u2014that is, all other languages of Spain\u2014will also be official in their respective autonomous communities in accordance to their Statutes, their organic regional legislations, and that the "richness of the distinct linguistic modalities of Spain represents a patrimony which will be the object of special respect and protection."', u'The other official languages of Spain, co-official with Spanish are:\nBasque (euskara) in the Basque Country and Navarre;\nCatalan (catal\xe0) in Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and in the Valencian Community, where its distinct modality of the language is officially known as Valencian (valenci\xe0); and\nGalician (galego) in Galicia\nAs a percentage of the general population, Basque is spoken by 2%, Catalan (or Valencian) by 17%, and Galician by 7% of all Spaniards.', u'In Catalonia, Aranese (aran\xe9s), a local variety of the Occitan language, has been declared co-official along with Catalan and Spanish since 2006.', u"It is spoken only in the comarca of Val d'Aran by roughly 6,700 people.", u'Other Romance minority languages, though not official, have special recognition, such as the Astur-Leonese group (Asturian \u2013 asturianu, also called bable \u2013 in Asturias and Leonese \u2013 llion\xe9s \u2013 in Castile and Le\xf3n) and Aragonese (aragon\xe9s) in Aragon.', u'In the North African Spanish autonomous city of Melilla, Riff Berber is spoken by a significant part of the population.', u'In the tourist areas of the Mediterranean coast and the islands, English and German are widely spoken by tourists, foreign residents, and tourism workers.', u'=== Education ===\n\nState education in Spain is free and compulsory from the age of six to sixteen.', u'The current education system was established by the 2006 educational law, LOE (Ley Org\xe1nica de Educaci\xf3n), or Fundamental Law for the Education.', u'In 2014, the LOE was partially modified by the newer and controversial LOMCE law (Ley Org\xe1nica para la Mejora de la Calidad Educativa), or Fundamental Law for the Improvement of the Education System, commonly called Ley Wert (Wert Law).', u'Since 1970 to 2014, Spain has had seven different educational laws (LGE, LOECE, LODE, LOGSE, LOPEG, LOE and LOMCE).', u'Instituci\xf3n Libre de Ense\xf1anza was an educational project that developed in Spain for the half a century of about 1876\u20131936 by Francisco Giner de los R\xedos and Gumersindo de Azc\xe1rate.', u'The institute was inspired by the philosophy of Krausism.', u'Concepci\xf3n Arenal in feminism and Santiago Ram\xf3n y Cajal in neuroscience were in the movement.', u'=== Religion ===\n\nRoman Catholicism has long been the main religion of Spain, and although it no longer has official status by law, in all public schools in Spain students have to choose either a religion or ethics class, and Catholicism is the only religion officially taught.', u'According to a June 2016 study by the Spanish Centre for Sociological Research about 68% of Spaniards self-identify as Catholics, 2% other faith, and about 27% identify with no religion.', u'Most Spaniards do not participate regularly in religious services.', u'This same study shows that of the Spaniards who identify themselves as religious, 59% hardly ever or never go to church, 16% go to church some times a year, 9% some time per month and 15% every Sunday or multiple times per week.', u'Recent polls and surveys have revealed that atheists and agnostics comprise anywhere from 20% to 27% of the Spanish population.', u'Altogether, about 9% of the entire Spanish population attends religious services at least once per month.', u'Though Spanish society has become considerably more secular in recent decades, the influx of Latin American immigrants, who tend to be strong Catholic practitioners, has helped the Catholic Church to recover.', u'There have been four Spanish Popes.', u'Damasus I, Calixtus III, Alexander VI and Benedict XIII.', u'Spanish mysticism was an important intellectual fight against Protestantism with Teresa of \xc1vila, a reformist nun, ahead.', u'The Society of Jesus was founded by Ignatius of Loyola and Francisco Javier.', u'In the 60s of the 20th century, Jesuits Pedro Arrupe and Ignacio Ellacur\xeda were inside the movement of Liberation Theology.', u'Protestant churches have about 1,200,000 members.', u"There are about 105,000 Jehovah's Witnesses.", u'The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has approximately 46,000 adherents in 133 congregations in all regions of the country and has a temple in the Moratalaz District of Madrid.', u'A study made by the Union of Islamic Communities of Spain demonstrated that there were about 1,700,000 inhabitants of Muslim background living in Spain as of 2012, accounting for 3\u20134% of the total population of Spain.', u'The vast majority was composed of immigrants and descendants originating from Morocco and other African countries.', u'More than 514,000 (30%) of them had Spanish nationality.', u'The recent waves of immigration have also led to an increasing number of Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs and Muslims.', u'After the Reconquista in 1492, Muslims did not live in Spain for centuries.', u'Late 19th-century colonial expansion in northwestern Africa gave a number of residents in Spanish Morocco and Western Sahara full citizenship.', u'Their ranks have since been bolstered by recent immigration, especially from Morocco and Algeria.', u'Judaism was practically non-existent in Spain from the 1492 expulsion until the 19th century, when Jews were again permitted to enter the country.', u'Currently there are around 62,000 Jews in Spain, or 0.14% of the total population.', u'Most are arrivals in the past century, while some are descendants of earlier Spanish Jews.', u'Approximately 80,000 Jews are thought to have lived in Spain prior to its expulsion.', u'== Culture ==\n\nCulturally, Spain is a Western country.', u'Almost every aspect of Spanish life is permeated by its Roman heritage, making Spain one of the major Latin countries of Europe.', u"Spanish culture is marked by strong historic ties to Catholicism, which played a pivotal role in the country's formation and subsequent identity.", u"Spanish art, architecture, cuisine, and music has been shaped by successive waves of foreign invaders, as well as by the country's Mediterranean climate and geography.", u'The centuries-long colonial era globalised Spanish language and culture, with Spain also absorbing the cultural and commercial products of its diverse empire.', u'=== Monuments and World Heritage Sites ===\n\nIt should be noted that after Italy (49) and China (45), Spain is the third country in the world with the most World Heritage Sites.', u'At the present time it has 44 recognised sites, including the landscape of Monte Perdido in the Pyrenees, which is shared with France, the Prehistoric Rock Art Sites of the C\xf4a Valley and Siega Verde, which is shared with Portugal (the Portuguese part being in the C\xf4a Valley, Guarda), and the Heritage of Mercury, shared with Slovenia.', u'In addition, Spain has also 14 Intangible cultural heritage, or "Human

'as they were'.", u'In the spirit of general "Realism", Realist authors opted for depictions of everyday and banal activities and experiences, instead of romanticised or stylised presentations.', u"The group that has become known as the Generation of 1898 was marked by the destruction of Spain's fleet in Cuba by US gunboats in 1898, which provoked a cultural crisis in Spain.", u'The "Disaster" of 1898 led established writers to seek practical political, economic, and social solutions in essays grouped under the literary heading of Regeneracionismo.', u'For a group of younger writers, among them Miguel de Unamuno, P\xedo Baroja, and Jos\xe9 Mart\xednez Ruiz (Azor\xedn), the Disaster and its cultural repercussions inspired a deeper, more radical literary shift that affected both form and content.', u"These writers, along with Ram\xf3n del Valle-Incl\xe1n, Antonio Machado, Ramiro de Maeztu, and \xc1ngel Ganivet, came to be known as the Generation of '98.", u'The Generation of 1914 or

influential in the development of various European artistic movements.', u'Due to historical, geographical and generational diversity, Spanish art has known a great number of influences.', u'The Moorish heritage in Spain, especially in Andalusia, is still evident today and European influences include Italy, Germany and France, especially during the Baroque and Neoclassical periods.', u'During the Golden Age we find painters such as El Greco, Jos\xe9 de Ribera, Bartolom\xe9 Esteban Murillo and Francisco Zurbar\xe1n.', u'Also inside Baroque period Diego Vel\xe1zquez created some of the most famous Spanish portraits, like Las Meninas or Las Hilanderas.', u'Francisco Goya painted during a historical period that includes the Spanish Independence War, the fights between liberals and absolutists, and the raise of state-nations.', u'Joaqu\xedn Sorolla is a well-known impressionist painter and there are many important Spanish painters belonging to the modernism art movement, including Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dal\xed, Juan Gris and Joan Mir\xf3.', u'=== Sculpture ===\n\nThe Plateresque style extended from beginnings of the 16th century until the last third of the century and its stylistic influence pervaded the works of all great Spanish artists of the time.', u'Alonso Berruguete (Valladolid School) is called the "Prince of Spanish sculpture".', u'His main works were the upper stalls of the choir of the Cathedral of Toledo, the tomb of Cardinal Tavera in the same Cathedral, and the altarpiece of the Visitation in the church of Santa \xdarsula in the same locality.', u'Other notable sculptors were Bartolom\xe9 Ord\xf3\xf1ez, Diego de Silo\xe9, Juan de Juni and Dami\xe1n Forment.', u'There were two Schools of special flair and talent: the Seville School, to which Juan Mart\xednez Monta\xf1\xe9s belonged, whose most celebrated works are the Crucifix in the Cathedral of Seville, another in Vergara, and a Saint John; and the Granada School, to

have become Hollywood stars.', u'=== Architecture ===\n\nDue to its historical and geographical diversity, Spanish architecture has drawn from a host of influences.', u'An important provincial city founded by the Romans and with an extensive Roman era infrastructure, C\xf3rdoba became the cultural capital, including fine Arabic style architecture, during the time of the Islamic Umayyad dynasty.', u'Later Arab style architecture continued to be developed under successive Islamic dynasties, ending with the Nasrid, which built its famed palace complex in Granada.', u'Simultaneously, the Christian kingdoms gradually emerged and developed their own styles; developing a pre-Romanesque style when for a while isolated from contemporary mainstream European architectural influences during the earlier Middle Ages, they later integrated the Romanesque and Gothic streams.', u'There was then an extraordinary flowering of the Gothic style that resulted in numerous instances being built throughout the entire territory.', u'The Mud\xe9jar style, from the 12th to 17th centuries, was developed by introducing Arab style motifs, patterns and elements into European architecture.', u'The arrival of Modernism in the academic arena produced much of the architecture of the 20th century.', u'An influential style centred in Barcelona, known as modernisme, produced a number of important architects, of which Gaud\xed is one.', u'The International style was led by groups like GATEPAC.', u'Spain is currently experiencing a revolution in contemporary architecture and Spanish architects like Rafael Moneo, Santiago Calatrava, Ricardo Bofill as well as many others have gained worldwide renown.', u'=== Music and dance ===\n\nSpanish music is often considered abroad to be synonymous with flamenco, a West Andalusian musical genre, which, contrary to popular belief, is not widespread outside that region.', u'Various regional styles of folk music abound in Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia, Castile, the Basque Country, Galicia and Asturias.', u'Pop, rock, hip hop and heavy metal are also popular.', u'In the field of classical music, Spain has produced a number of noted composers such as Isaac Alb\xe9niz, Manuel de Falla and Enrique Granados and singers and performers such as Pl\xe1cido Domingo, Jos\xe9 Carreras, Montserrat Caball\xe9, Alicia de Larrocha, Alfredo Kraus, Pablo Casals, Ricardo Vi\xf1es, Jos\xe9 Iturbi, Pablo de Sarasate, Jordi Savall and Teresa Berganza.', u'In Spain there are over forty professional orchestras, including the Orquestra

Palau de les Arts Reina Sof\xeda.', u'Thousands of music fans also travel to Spain each year for internationally recognised summer music festivals S\xf3nar which often features the top up and coming pop and techno acts, and Benic\xe0ssim which tends to feature alternative rock and dance acts.', u'Both festivals mark Spain as an international music presence and reflect the tastes of young people in the country.', u'The most popular traditional musical instrument, the guitar, originated in Spain.', u'Typical of the north are the traditional bag pipers or gaiteros, mainly in Asturias and Galicia.', u'=== Cuisine ===\n\nSpanish cuisine consists of a great variety of dishes which stem from differences in geography, culture and climate.', u"It is heavily influenced by seafood available from the waters that surround the country, and reflects the country's deep Mediterranean roots.", u"Spain's extensive history with many cultural influences has led to a unique cuisine.", u'In particular, three main divisions are easily identified:\nMediterranean Spain \u2013 all such coastal regions, from Catalonia to Andalusia \u2013 heavy use of seafood, such as pesca\xedto frito (fried fish); several cold soups like gazpacho; and many rice-based dishes like paella from Valencia and arr\xf2s negre (black rice) from Catalonia.', u'Inner Spain \u2013 Castile \u2013 hot, thick soups such as the bread and garlic-based Castilian soup, along with substantious stews such as cocido madrile\xf1o.', u'Food is traditionally conserved by salting, like Spanish ham, or immersed in olive oil, like Manchego cheese.', u'Atlantic Spain \u2013 the whole Northern coast, including Asturian, Basque, Cantabrian and Galician cuisine \u2013 vegetable and fish-based stews like caldo gallego and marmitako.', u'Also, the lightly cured lac\xf3n ham.', u'The best known cuisine of the northern countries often rely on ocean seafood, like the Basque-style cod, albacore or anchovy or the Galician octopus-based polbo \xe1 feira and shellfish dishes.', u'=== Sport ===\n\nWhile varieties of football had been played in Spain as far back as Roman times, sport in Spain has been dominated by English style association football since the early 20th century.', u'Real Madrid C.F.', u'and FC Barcelona are two of the most successful football clubs in the world.', u"The country's national football team won the UEFA European Football Championship in 1964, 2008 and 2012 and the FIFA World Cup in 2010, and is the first team to ever win three back-to-back major international tournaments.", u'Basketball, tennis, cycling, handball, futsal, motorcycling and, lately, Formula One are also important due to the presence of Spanish champions in all these disciplines.', u'Today, Spain is a major world sports powerhouse, especially since the 1992 Summer Olympics that were hosted in Barcelona, which stimulated a great deal of interest in sports in the country.', u'The tourism industry has led to an improvement in sports infrastructure, especially for water sports, golf and skiing.', u"Rafael Nadal is the leading Spanish tennis player and has won several Grand Slam titles including the Wimbledon 2010 men's singles.", u'In north Spain, the game of pelota is very popular.', u'Alberto Contador is the leading Spanish cyclist and has won several Grand Tour titles including two Tour de France

San Ferm\xedn, in Pamplona.', u'While its most famous event is the encierro, or the running of the bulls, which happens at 8:00 am from 7 to 14 July, the week-long celebration involves many other traditional and folkloric events.', u'Its events were central to the plot of The Sun Also Rises, by Ernest Hemingway, which brought it to the general attention of English-speaking people.', u'As a result, it has become one of the most internationally renowned fiestas in Spain, with over 1,000,000 people attending every year.', u'Other festivals include the carnivals in the Canary Islands, the

{'sentences': [u'Andrei Dmitrievich Sakharov (Russian: \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0301\u0439 \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0301\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0421\u0430\u0301\u0445\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432; 21 May 1921 \u2013 14 December 1989) was a Russian nuclear physicist, Soviet dissident, an activist for disarmament, peace and human rights.', u"He became renowned as the designer of the Soviet Union's Third Idea, a codename for Soviet development of thermonuclear weapons.", u'Sakharov later became an advocate of civil liberties and civil reforms in the Soviet Union, for which he faced state persecution; these efforts earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975.', u'The Sakharov Prize, which is awarded annually by the European Parliament for people and organizations dedicated to human rights and freedoms, is named in his honour.', u'== Biography ==\n\nSakharov was born in Moscow on May 21, 1921.', u'His father was Dmitri Ivanovich Sakharov, a private school physics teacher and an amateur pianist.', u'His father later taught at the Second Moscow State University.', u"Andrei's grandfather Ivan had been a prominent lawyer in the Russian Empire who had displayed respect for social awareness and humanitarian principles (including advocating the abolition of capital punishment) that would later influence his grandson.", u"Sakharov's mother was Yekaterina Alekseyevna Sakharova, a great-granddaughter of the prominent military commander Alexey Semenovich Sofiano (who was of Greek ancestry).", u"Sakharov's parents and paternal grandmother, Maria Petrovna, largely shaped his personality.", u"Although Sakharov's paternal great-grandfather had been a priest in the Russian Orthodox Church, and his pious mother had him baptised, Sakharov was an atheist in later life.", u'However, he did believe that a "guiding principle" governed the universe and human life.', u'=== Education and career ===\nSakharov entered Moscow State University in 1938.', u"Following evacuation in 1941 during the Great Patriotic War (World War II), he graduated in A\u015fgabat, in today's Turkmenistan.", u'He was then assigned to laboratory work in Ulyanovsk.', u'In 1943, he married Klavdia Alekseyevna Vikhireva, with whom he raised two daughters and a son before she died in 1969.', u'He returned to Moscow in 1945 to study at the Theoretical Department of FIAN (the Physical Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences).', u'He received his Ph.D. in 1947.', u'=== Development of thermonuclear devices ===\n\nAfter the end of World War II, he researched cosmic rays.', u'In mid-1948 he participated in the Soviet atomic bomb project under Igor Kurchatov and Igor Tamm.', u"Sakharov's study group at FIAN in 1948 came up with a second concept in August\u2013September 1948.", u'Adding a shell of natural, unenriched uranium around the deuterium would increase the deuterium concentration at the uranium-deuterium boundary and the overall yield of the device, because the natural uranium would capture neutrons and itself fission as part of the thermonuclear reaction.', u'This idea of a layered fission-fusion-fission bomb led Sakharov to call it the sloika, or layered cake.', u'The first Soviet atomic device was tested on August 29, 1949.', u"After moving to Sarov in 1950, Sakharov played a key role in the development of the first megaton-range Soviet hydrogen bomb using a design known as Sakharov's Third Idea in Russia and the Teller-Ulam design in the United States.", u'Before his Third Idea, Sakharov tried a "layer cake" of alternating layers of fission and fusion fuel.', u'The results were disappointing, yielding no more than a typical fission bomb.', u'However the design was seen to be worth pursuing because deuterium is abundant and uranium is scarce, and he had no idea how powerful the US design was.', u'One of the Bikini atomic experiments changed that, because the magnitude of the explosion became public knowledge when there was a dispute between Japan and the US over the contamination of a large area of ocean.', u'Sakharov was surprised by the size of the explosion and realized that the Americans had harnessed the power of a separate fission explosion to compress the fusion fuel.', u'Sakharov realised that in order to cause the explosion of one side of the fuel to symmetrically compress the fusion fuel, a mirror could be used to reflect the radiation.', u'The details had not been officially declassified in Russia when Sakharov was writing his memoirs, but in the Teller-Ulam design, soft X-rays emitted by the fission bomb were focused onto a cylinder of lithium deuteride to compress it symmetrically.', u'This is called radiation implosion.', u'The Teller-Ulam design also had a secondary fission device inside the fusion cylinder to assist with the compression of the fusion fuel and generate neutrons to convert some of the lithium to tritium, producing a mixture of deuterium and tritium.', u"Sakharov's idea was first tested as RDS-37 in 1955.", u'A larger variation of the same design which Sakharov worked on was the 50 Mt Tsar Bomba of October 1961, which was the most powerful nuclear device ever detonated.', u'Sakharov saw "striking parallels" between his fate and those of J. Robert Oppenheimer and Edward Teller in the USA.', u'Sakharov believed that in this "tragic confrontation of two outstanding people", both deserved respect, because "each of them was certain he had right on his side and was morally obligated to go to the end in the name of truth."', u'While Sakharov strongly disagreed with Teller over nuclear testing in the atmosphere and the Strategic Defense Initiative, he believed that American academics had been unfair to Teller\'s resolve to get the H-bomb for the United States since "all steps by the Americans of a temporary or permanent rejection of developing thermonuclear weapons would have been seen either as a clever feint, or as the manifestation of stupidity.', u'In both cases, the reaction would have been the same \u2013 avoid the trap and immediately take advantage of the enemy\'s stupidity."', u'Sakharov never felt that by creating nuclear weapons he had "known sin", in Oppenheimer\'s expression.', u'He later wrote: "After more than forty years, we have had no third world war, and the balance of nuclear terror ... may have helped to prevent one.', u"But I am not at all sure of this; back then, in those long-gone years, the question didn't even arise.", u'What most troubles me now is the instability of the balance, the extreme peril of the current situation, the appalling waste of the arms race ... Each of us has a responsibility to think about this in global terms, with tolerance, trust, and candor, free from ideological dogmatism, parochial interests, or national egotism."', u'=== Support for peaceful use of nuclear technology ===\n\nIn 1950 he proposed an idea for a controlled nuclear fusion reactor, the tokamak, which is still the basis for the majority of work in the area.', u'Sakharov, in association with Igor Tamm, proposed confining extremely hot ionized plasma by torus shaped magnetic fields for controlling thermonuclear fusion that led to the development of the tokamak device.', u'=== Efforts to improve nuclear reactor technology ===\nIn 1951 he invented and tested the first explosively pumped flux compression generators, compressing magnetic fields by explosives.', u'He called these devices MC or MK (for magnetocumulative) generators.', u'The radial MK-1 produced a pulsed magnetic field of 25 megagauss (2500 teslas).', u'The resulting helical MK-2 generated 1000 million amperes in 1953.', u'Sakharov then tested a MK-driven "plasma cannon" where a small aluminum ring was vaporized by huge eddy currents into a stable, self-confined toroidal plasmoid and was accelerated to 100 km/s.', u'Sakharov later suggested replacing the copper coil in MK generators with a large superconductor solenoid to magnetically compress and focus underground nuclear explosions into a shaped charge effect.', u'He theorized this could focus 1023 protons per second on a 1 mm2 surface.', u'=== Research and physics ===\nAfter 1965 Sakharov returned to fundamental science and began working on particle physics and cosmology.', u'He tried to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe, being the first scientist to introduce two universes called "sheets", linked by the Big Bang.', u'Sakharov achieved there a complete CPT symmetry since the second sheet is enantiomorph (P-symmetry), has an opposite arrow of time (T-symmetry) and is mainly populated by antimatter (C-symmetry) because of an opposite CP-violation.', u'In this model the two universes do not interact, except via local matter accumulation whose density and pressure become high enough to connect the two sheets through a bridge without spacetime between them, but with geodesics continuity beyond the radius limit allowing an exchange of matter.', u'Sakharov called such singularities a collapse and an anticollapse, which are an alternative to the couple black hole and white hole in the wormhole theory.', u'Sakharov also proposed the idea of induced gravity as an alternative theory of quantum gravity.', u'=== Turn to activism ===\nSince the late 1950s Sakharov had become concerned about the moral and political implications of his work.', u'Politically active during the 1960s, Sakharov was against nuclear proliferation.', u'Pushing for the end of atmospheric tests, he played a role in the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty, signed in Moscow.', u'Sakharov was also involved in an event with political consequences in 1964, when the USSR Academy of Sciences nominated for full membership Nikolai Nuzhdin, a follower of Trofim Lysenko (initiator of the Stalin-supported anti-genetics campaign Lysenkoism).', u'Contrary to normal practice Sakharov, a member of the Academy, publicly spoke out against full membership for Nuzhdin, holding him responsible for "for the defamation, firing, arrest, even death, of many genuine scientists."', u'In the end, Nuzhdin was not elected, but the episode prompted Sergei Khrushchev to order the KGB to gather compromising material on Sakharov.', u"The major turn in Sakharov's political evolution came in 1967, when anti-ballistic missile defense became a key issue in US\u2013Soviet relations.", u'In a secret detailed letter to the Soviet leadership of July 21, 1967, Sakharov explained the need to "take the Americans at their word" and accept their proposal for a "bilateral rejection by the USA and the Soviet Union of the development of antiballistic missile defense", because otherwise an arms race in this new technology would increase the likelihood of nuclear war.', u'He also asked permission to publish his manuscript (which accompanied the letter) in a newspaper to explain the dangers posed by this kind of defense.', u'The government ignored his letter and refused to let him initiate a public discussion of ABMs in the Soviet press.', u'In May 1968 Sakharov completed an essay entitled "Reflections on Progress, Peaceful Coexistence, and Intellectual Freedom".', u'In it, he described the anti-ballistic missile defense as a major threat of world nuclear war.', u'After this essay was circulated in samizdat and then published outside the Soviet Union, Sakharov was banned from conducting any military-related research and returned to FIAN to study fundamental theoretical physics.', u'Over the next twelve years, until his exile to Gorky (Nizhny Novgorod) in January 1980, Andrei Sakharov assumed the role of a widely recognized and open dissident in Moscow.', u'He stood vigil outside of closed courtrooms, wrote appeals on behalf of more than two hundred individual prisoners, and continued to write essays about the need for democratization.', u'In 1970 Sakharov was among the three founding members of the Committee on Human Rights in the USSR along with Valery Chalidze and Andrei Tverdokhlebov.', u'The Committee wrote appeals, collected signatures for petitions and succeeded in affiliating with several international human rights organizations.', u'Its work was the subject of many KGB reports and brought Sakharov under increasing pressure from the government.', u'Sakharvov married a fellow human rights activist, Yelena Bonner, in 1972.', u'By 1973 Sakharov was meeting regularly with Western correspondents, holding press conferences in his apartment.', u"He appealed to the U.S. Congress to approve the 1974 Jackson-Vanik Amendment to a trade bill, which coupled trade tariffs to the Kremlin's willingness to allow freer emigration.", u'=== Attacked by Soviet establishment, 1972 onwards ===\n\nIn 1972 Sakharov became the target of sustained pressure and intimidation, from his fellow scientists in the USSR Academy of Sciences, the Soviet press and direct threats of physical assault.', u'Dissident activists, including the writer Solzhenitsyn, sprang to his defence.', u'In 1973 and 1974, the Soviet media campaign continued, targeting both Sakharov and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.', u"While Sakharov disagreed with Solzhenitsyn's vision of Russian revival, he deeply respected him for his courage.", u"Only a few individuals in the Soviet Union were willing to defend 'traitors' like Sakharov and Solzhenitsyn, and those who had dared were inevitably punished.", u'Sakharov later described that it took "years" for him to "understand how much substitution, deceit, and lack of correspondence with reality there was" in the Soviet ideals.', u'"At first I thought, despite everything that I saw with my own eyes, that the Soviet State was a breakthrough into the future, a kind of prototype for all countries".', u'Then he came, in his words, to "the theory of symmetry: all governments and regimes to a first approximation are bad, all peoples are oppressed, and all are threatened by common dangers."', u'After that he realized that there is not much "symmetry between a cancer cell and a normal one.', u'Yet our state is similar to a cancer cell \u2013 with its messianism and expansionism, its totalitarian suppression of dissent, the authoritarian structure of power, with a total absence of public control in the most important decisions in domestic and foreign policy, a closed society that does not inform its citizens of anything substantial, closed to the outside world, without freedom of travel or the exchange of information."', u"Sakharov's ideas on social development led him to put forward the principle of human rights as a new basis of all politics.", u'In his works he declared that "the principle \'what is not prohibited is allowed\' should be understood literally", defying the unwritten ideological rules imposed by the Communist ruling elite on the society in spite of the seemingly democratic (1936) USSR Constitution.', u'In no way did Sakharov consider himself a prophet or the like: "I am no volunteer priest of the idea, but simply a man with an unusual fate.', u'I am against all kinds of self-immolation (for myself and for others, including the people closest to me)."', u'In a letter written from exile, he cheered up a fellow physicist and human rights activist with the words: "Fortunately, the future is unpredictable and also \u2013 because of quantum effects \u2013 uncertain."', u'For Sakharov the indeterminacy of the future supported his belief that he could, and should, take personal responsibility for it.', u'=== Nobel Peace Prize (1975) ===\nIn 1973, Sakharov was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize and in 1974 was awarded the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca.', u'Sakharov was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975.', u'The Norwegian Nobel Committee called him "a spokesman for the conscience of mankind".', u'In the words of the Nobel Committee\'s citation: "In a convincing manner Sakharov has emphasised that Man\'s inviolable rights provide the only safe foundation for genuine and enduring international cooperation."', u'Sakharov was not allowed to leave the Soviet Union to collect the prize.', u'His wife Yelena Bonner read his speech at the ceremony in Oslo, Norway.', u'On the day the prize was awarded, Sakharov was in Vilnius, where human rights activist Sergei Kovalev was being tried.', u'In his Nobel lecture, titled "Peace, Progress, Human Rights", Sakharov called for an end to the arms race, greater respect for the environment, international cooperation, and universal respect for human rights.', u'He included a list of prisoners of conscience and political prisoners in the USSR, stating that he shares the prize with them.', u'By 1976 head of the KGB Yuri Andropov was prepared to call Sakharov "Domestic Enemy Number One" before a group of KGB officers.', u'=== Internal exile (1980\u20131986) ===\n\nSakharov was arrested on January 22, 1980, following his public protests against the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in 1979, and was sent to internal exile in the city of Gorky, now Nizhny Novgorod, a city that was off limits to foreigners.', u'Between 1980 and 1986, Sakharov was kept under tight Soviet police surveillance.', u'In his memoirs he mentions that their apartment in Gorky was repeatedly subjected to searches and heists.', u'Sakharov was named the 1980 Humanist of the Year by the American Humanist Association.', u"In May 1984, Sakharov's wife, Yelena Bonner, was detained and Sakharov began a hunger strike, demanding permission for his wife to travel to the United States for heart surgery.", u'He was forcibly hospitalized and force-fed.', u'He was held in isolation for four months.', u'In August 1984 Yelena Bonner was sentenced by a court to five years of exile in Gorky.', u'In April 1985, Sakharov started a new hunger strike for his wife to travel abroad for medical treatment.', u'He again was taken to a hospital and force-fed.', u'In August the Politburo discussed what to do about Sakharov.', u'He remained in the hospital until October 1985 when his wife was allowed to travel to the United States.', u'She had heart surgery in the United States and returned to Gorky in June 1986.', u'In December 1985, the European Parliament established the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, to be given annually for outstanding contributions to human rights.', u'On December 19, 1986, Mikhail Gorbachev, who had initiated the policies of perestroika and glasnost, called Sakharov to tell him that he and his wife could return to Moscow.', u'=== Political leader ===\nIn 1988, Sakharov was given the International Humanist Award by the International Humanist and Ethical Union.', u"He helped to initiate the first independent legal political organizations and became prominent in the Soviet Union's growing political opposition.", u"In March 1989, Sakharov was elected to the new parliament, the All-Union Congress of People's Deputies and co-led the democratic opposition, the Inter-Regional Deputies Group.", u"In November the head of the KGB reported to Mikhail Gorbachev on Sakharov's encouragement and support for the coal-miners' strike in Vorkuta.", u'=== Death ===\n\nSoon after 21:00 on December 14, 1989, Sakharov went to his study to take a nap before preparing an important speech he was to deliver the next day in the Congress.', u'His wife went to wake him at 23:00 as he had requested but she found Sakharov dead on the floor.', u'According to the notes of Yakov Rapoport, a senior pathologist present at the autopsy, it is most likely that Sakharov died of an arrhythmia consequent to dilated cardiomyopathy at the age of 68.', u'He was interred in the Vostryakovskoye Cemetery in Moscow.', u'== Influence ==\n\n\n=== Memorial prizes ===\nThe Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought was established in 1988 by the European Parliament in his honour, and is the highest tribute to human rights endeavours awarded by the European Union.', u'It is awarded annually by the parliament to "those who carry the spirit of Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov"; to "Laureates who, like Sakharov, dedicate their lives to peaceful struggle for human rights."', u'An Andrei Sakharov prize has also been awarded by the American Physical Society every second year since 2006 "to recognize outstanding leadership and/or achievements of scientists in upholding human rights".', u"The Andrei Sakharov Prize For Writer's Civic Courage was established in October 1990.", u'In 2004, with the approval of Elena Bonner, an annual Sakharov Prize for journalism was established for reporters and commentators in Russia.', u'Funded by former Soviet dissident Pyotr Vins, now a businessman in the USA, the prize is administered by the Glasnost Defence Foundation in Moscow.', u'The prize "for journalism as an act of conscience" has been won over the years by famous journalists such as Anna Politkovskaya and young reporters and editors working far from Russia\'s media capital, Moscow.', u'The 2015 winner was Yelena Kostyuchenko.', u'=== Andrei Sakharov Archives and Human Rights Center ===\nThe Andrei Sakharov Archives and Human Rights Center, established at Brandeis University in 1993, are now housed at Harvard University.', u'The documents from that archive were published by the Yale University Press in 2005.', u'These documents are available online.', u'Most of documents of the archive are letters from the head of the KGB to the Central Committee about activities of Soviet dissidents and recommendations about the interpretation in newspapers.', u'The letters cover the period from 1968 to 1991 (Brezhnev stagnation).', u"The documents characterize not only Sakharov's activity, but that of other dissidents, as well as that of highest-position apparatchiks and the KGB.", u'No Russian equivalent of the KGB archive is available.', u'== Legacy and remembrance ==\n\n\n=== Places ===\nIn Moscow, there is Academician Sakharov Avenue and Sakharov Center\nDuring the 1980s, the block of 16th Street NW between L and M streets, in front of the Russian ambassador\'s residence in Washington, D.C. was renamed "Andrei Sakharov Plaza" as a form of protest against his 1980 arrest and detention.', u'In Yerevan, the capital of Armenia, Sakharov Square, located in the heart of the city, is named after him.', u'The Sakharov Gardens (est.', u'1990) are located at the entrance to Jerusalem, Israel, off

{'sentences': [u'A society is a group of people involved in persistent social interaction, or a large social grouping sharing the same geographical or social territory, typically subject to the same political authority and dominant cultural expectations.', u'Societies are characterized by patterns of relationships (social relations) between individuals who share a distinctive culture and institutions; a given society may be described as the sum total of such relationships among its constituent members.', u'In the social sciences, a larger society often evinces stratification or dominance patterns in subgroups.', u'Insofar as it is collaborative, a society can enable its members to benefit in ways that would not otherwise be possible on an individual basis; both individual and social (common) benefits can thus be distinguished, or in many cases found to overlap.', u'A society can also consist of like-minded people governed by their own norms and values within a dominant, larger society.', u'This is sometimes referred to as a subculture, a term used extensively within criminology.', u'More broadly, and especially within structuralist thought, a society may be illustrated as an economic, social, industrial or cultural infrastructure, made up of, yet distinct from, a varied collection of individuals.', u'In this regard society can mean the objective relationships people have with the material world and with other people, rather than "other people" beyond the individual and their familiar social environment.', u'== Etymology and usage ==\n\nThe term "society" came from the Latin word societas, which in turn was derived from the noun socius ("comrade, friend, ally"; adjectival form socialis) used to describe a bond or interaction between parties that are friendly, or at least civil.', u'Without an article, the term can refer to the entirety of humanity (also: "society in general", "society at large", etc.', u'), although those who are unfriendly or uncivil to the remainder of society in this sense may be deemed to be "antisocial".', u'However, the Scottish economist, Adam Smith taught instead that a society "may subsist among different men, as among different merchants, from a sense of its utility without any mutual love or affection, if only they refrain from doing injury to each other."', u'Used in the sense of an association, a society is a body of individuals outlined by the bounds of functional interdependence, possibly comprising characteristics such as national or cultural identity, social solidarity, language, or hierarchical structure.', u'== Conceptions ==\nSociety, in general, addresses the fact that an individual has rather limited means as an autonomous unit.', u'The great apes have always been more (Bonobo, Homo, Pan) or less (Gorilla, Pongo) social animals, so Robinson Crusoe-like situations are either fictions or unusual corner cases to the ubiquity of social context for humans, who fall between presocial and eusocial in the spectrum of animal ethology.', u'Societies are most often organized according to their primary means of subsistence.', u'Social scientists have identified hunter-gatherer societies, nomadic pastoral societies, horticulturalist or simple farming societies, and intensive agricultural societies, also called civilizations.', u'Some consider industrial and post-industrial societies to be qualitatively different from traditional agricultural societies.', u'Today, anthropologists and many social scientists vigorously oppose the notion of cultural evolution and rigid "stages" such as these.', u'In fact, much anthropological data has suggested that complexity (civilization, population growth and density, specialization, etc.)', u'does not always take the form of hierarchical social organization or stratification.', u'Cultural relativism as a widespread approach or ethic has largely replaced notions of "primitive", better/worse, or "progress" in relation to cultures (including their material culture/technology and social organization).', u"According to anthropologist Maurice Godelier, one critical novelty in society, in contrast to humanity's closest biological relatives (chimpanzees and bonobos), is the parental role assumed by the males, which supposedly would be absent in our nearest relatives for whom paternity is not generally determinable.", u'=== In political science ===\nSocieties may also be structured politically.', u'In order of increasing size and complexity, there are bands, tribes, chiefdoms, and state societies.', u'These structures may have varying degrees of political power, depending on the cultural, geographical, and historical environments that these societies must contend with.', u'Thus, a more isolated society with the same level of technology and culture as other societies is more likely to survive than one in closer proximity to others that may encroach on their resources.', u'A society that is unable to offer an effective response to other societies it competes with will usually be subsumed into the culture of the competing society.', u'=== In sociology ===\n\nSociologist Peter L. Berger defines society as "...a human product, and nothing but a human product, that yet continuously acts upon its producers."', u'According to him, society was created by humans but this creation turns back and creates or molds humans every day.', u'Sociologist Gerhard Lenski differentiates societies based on their level of technology, communication, and economy: (1) hunters and gatherers, (2) simple agricultural, (3) advanced agricultural, (4) industrial, and (5) special (e.g.', u'fishing societies or maritime societies).', u'This is similar to the system earlier developed by anthropologists Morton H. Fried, a conflict theorist, and Elman Service, an integration theorist, who have produced a system of classification for societies in all human cultures based on the evolution of social inequality and the role of the state.', u'This system of classification contains four categories:\nHunter-gatherer bands (categorization of duties and responsibilities).', u'Tribal societies in which there are some limited instances of social rank and prestige.', u'Stratified structures led by chieftains.', u'Civilizations, with complex social hierarchies and organized, institutional governments.', u"In addition to this there are:\nHumanity, mankind, upon which rest all the elements of society, including society's beliefs.", u'Virtual society, a society based on online identity, which is evolving in the information age.', u'Over time, some cultures have progressed toward more complex forms of organization and control.', u'This cultural evolution has a profound effect on patterns of community.', u'Hunter-gatherer tribes settled around seasonal food stocks to become agrarian villages.', u'Villages grew to become towns and cities.', u'Cities turned into city-states and nation-states.', u'Many societies distribute largess at the behest of some individual or some larger group of people.', u'This type of generosity can be seen in all known cultures; typically, prestige accrues to the generous individual or group.', u'Conversely, members of a society may also shun or scapegoat members of the society who violate its norms.', u'Mechanisms such as gift-giving, joking relationships and scapegoating, which may be seen in various types of human groupings, tend to be institutionalized within a society.', u'Social evolution as a phenomenon carries with it certain elements that could be detrimental to the population it serves.', u'Some societies bestow status on an individual or group of people when that individual or group performs an admired or desired action.', u'This type of recognition is bestowed in the form of a name, title, manner of dress, or monetary reward.', u'In many societies, adult male or female status is subject to a ritual or process of this type.', u'Altruistic action in the interests of the larger group is seen in virtually all societies.', u'The phenomena of community action, shunning, scapegoating, generosity, shared risk, and reward are common to many forms of society.', u'== Types ==\nSocieties are social groups that differ according to subsistence strategies, the ways that humans use technology to provide needs for themselves.', u'Although humans have established many types of societies throughout history, anthropologists tend to classify different societies according to the degree to which different groups within a society have unequal access to advantages such as resources, prestige, or power.', u'Virtually all societies have developed some degree of inequality among their people through the process of social stratification, the division of members of a society into levels with unequal wealth, prestige, or power.', u'Sociologists place societies in three broad categories: pre-industrial, industrial, and postindustrial.', u'=== Pre-industrial ===\n\nIn a pre-industrial society, food production, which is carried out through the use of human and animal labor, is the main economic activity.', u'These societies can be subdivided according to their level of technology and their method of producing food.', u'These subdivisions are hunting and gathering, pastoral, horticultural, agricultural, and feudal.', u'==== Hunting and gathering ====\n\nThe main form of food production in such societies is the daily collection of wild plants and the hunting of wild animals.', u'Hunter-gatherers move around constantly in search of food.', u'As a result, they do not build permanent villages or create a wide variety of artifacts, and usually only form small groups such as bands and tribes.', u'However, some hunting and gathering societies in areas with abundant resources (such as people of tlingit) lived in larger groups and formed complex hierarchical social structures such as chiefdom.', u'The need for mobility also limits the size of these societies.', u'They generally consist of fewer than 60 people and rarely exceed 100.', u'Statuses within the tribe are relatively equal, and decisions are reached through general agreement.', u'The ties that bind the tribe are more complex than those of the bands.', u'Leadership is personal\u2014charismatic\u2014and used for special purposes only in tribal society.', u'There are no political offices containing real power, and a chief is merely a person of influence, a sort of adviser; therefore, tribal consolidations for collective action are not governmental.', u'The family forms the main social unit, with most societal members being related by birth or marriage.', u'This type of organization requires the family to carry out most social functions, including production and education.', u'==== Pastoral ====\n\nPastoralism is a slightly more efficient form of subsistence.', u'Rather than searching for food on a daily basis, members of a pastoral society rely on domesticated herd animals to meet their food needs.', u'Pastoralists live a nomadic life, moving their herds from one pasture to another.', u'Because their food supply is far more reliable, pastoral societies can support larger populations.', u'Since there are food surpluses, fewer people are needed to produce food.', u'As a result, the division of labor (the specialization by individuals or groups in the performance of specific economic activities) becomes more complex.', u'For example, some people become craftworkers, producing tools, weapons, and jewelry.', u'The production of goods encourages trade.', u'This trade helps to create inequality, as some families acquire more goods than others do.', u'These families often gain power through their increased wealth.', u'The passing on of property from one generation to another helps to centralize wealth and power.', u'Over time emerge hereditary chieftainships, the typical form of government in pastoral societies.', u'==== Horticultural ====\n\nFruits and vegetables grown in garden plots that have been cleared from the jungle or forest provide the main source of food in a horticultural society.', u'These societies have a level of technology and complexity similar to pastoral societies.', u'Some horticultural groups use the slash-and-burn method to raise crops.', u'The wild vegetation is cut and burned, and ashes are used as fertilizers.', u'Horticulturists use human labor and simple tools to cultivate the land for one or more seasons.', u'When the land becomes barren, horticulturists clear a new plot and leave the old plot to revert to its natural state.', u'They may return to the original land several years later and begin the process again.', u'By rotating their garden plots, horticulturists can stay in one area for a fairly long period of time.', u'This allows them to build semipermanent or permanent villages.', u"The size of a village's population depends on the amount of land available for farming; thus villages can range from as few as 30 people to as many as 2000.", u'As with pastoral societies, surplus food leads to a more complex division of labor.', u'Specialized roles in horticultural societies include craftspeople, shamans (religious leaders), and traders.', u'This role specialization allows people to create a wide variety of artifacts.', u'As in pastoral societies, surplus food can lead to inequalities in wealth and power within horticultural political systems, developed because of the settled nature of horticultural life.', u'==== Agrarian ====\n\nAgrarian societies use agricultural technological advances to cultivate crops over a large area.', u'Sociologists use the phrase agricultural revolution to refer to the technological changes that occurred as long as 8,500 years ago that led to cultivating crops and raising farm animals.', u'Increases in food supplies then led to larger populations than in earlier communities.', u'This meant a greater surplus, which resulted in towns that became centers of trade supporting various rulers, educators, craftspeople, merchants, and religious leaders who did not have to worry about locating nourishment.', u'Greater degrees of social stratification appeared in agrarian societies.', u'For example, women previously had higher social status because they shared labor more equally with men.', u'In hunting and gathering societies, women even gathered more food than men.', u'However, as food stores improved and women took on lesser roles in providing food for the family, they increasingly became subordinate to men.', u'As villages and towns expanded into neighboring areas, conflicts with other communities inevitably occurred.', u'Farmers provided warriors with food in exchange for protection against invasion by enemies.', u'A system of rulers with high social status also appeared.', u'This nobility organized warriors to protect the society from invasion.', u'In this way, the nobility managed to extract goods from \u201clesser\u201d members of society.', u'==== Feudal ====\n\nFeudalism was a form of society based on ownership of land.', u"Unlike today's farmers, vassals under feudalism were bound to cultivating their lord's land.", u'In exchange for military protection, the lords exploited the peasants into providing food, crops, crafts, homage, and other services to the landowner.', u"The estates of the realm system of feudalism was often multigenerational; the families of peasants may have cultivated their lord's land for generations.", u'=== Industrial ===\n\nBetween the 15th and 16th centuries, a new economic system emerged that began to replace feudalism.', u'Capitalism is marked by open competition in a free market, in which the means of production are privately owned.', u"Europe's exploration of the Americas served as one impetus for the development of capitalism.", u'The introduction of foreign metals, silks, and spices stimulated great commercial activity in European societies.', u'Industrial societies rely heavily on machines powered by fuels for the production of goods.', u'This produced further dramatic increases in efficiency.', u'The increased efficiency of production of the industrial revolution produced an even greater surplus than before.', u'Now the surplus was not just agricultural goods, but also manufactured goods.', u'This larger surplus caused all of the changes discussed earlier in the domestication revolution to become even more pronounced.', u'Once again, the population boomed.', u'Increased productivity made more goods available to everyone.', u'However, inequality became even greater than before.', u'The breakup of agricultural-based feudal societies caused many people to leave the land and seek employment in cities.', u'This created a great surplus of labor and gave capitalists plenty of laborers who could be hired for extremely low wages.', u'=== Post-industrial ===\n\nPost-industrial societies are societies dominated by information, services, and high technology more than the production of goods.', u'Advanced industrial societies are now seeing a shift toward an increase in service sectors over manufacturing and production.', u'The United States is the first country to have over half of its work force employed in service industries.', u'Service industries include government, research, education, health, sales, law, and banking.', u'== Contemporary usage ==\nThe term "society" is currently used to cover both a number of political and scientific connotations as well as a variety of associations.', u'=== Western ===\n\nThe development of the Western world has brought with it the emerging concepts of Western culture, politics, and ideas, often referred to simply as "Western society".', u'Geographically, it covers at the very least the countries of Western Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand.', u'It sometimes also includes Eastern Europe, South America, and Israel.', u'The cultures and lifestyles of all of these stem from Western Europe.', u'They all enjoy relatively strong economies and stable governments, allow freedom of religion, have chosen democracy as a form of governance, favor capitalism and international trade, are heavily influenced by Judeo-Christian values, and have some form of political and military alliance or cooperation.', u'=== Information ===\n\nAlthough the concept of information society has been under discussion since the 1930s, in the modern world it is almost always applied to the manner in which information technologies have impacted society and culture.', u'It therefore covers the effects of computers and telecommunications on the home, the workplace, schools, government, and various communities and organizations, as well as the emergence of new social forms in cyberspace.', u"One of the European Union's areas of interest is the information society.", u'Here policies are directed towards promoting an open and competitive digital economy, research into information and communication technologies, as well as their application to improve social inclusion, public services, and quality of life.', u"The International Telecommunications Union's World Summit on the Information Society in Geneva and Tunis (2003 and 2005) has led to a number of policy and application areas where action is envisaged.", u'=== Knowledge ===\n\nAs access to electronic information resources increased at the beginning of the 21st century, special attention was extended from the information society to the knowledge society.', u'An analysis by the Irish government stated, "The capacity to manipulate, store and transmit large quantities of information cheaply has increased at a staggering rate over recent years.', u'The digitisation of information and the associated pervasiveness of the Internet are facilitating a new intensity in the application of knowledge to economic activity, to the extent that it has become the predominant factor in the creation of wealth.', u'As much as 70 to 80 percent of economic growth is now said to be due to new and better knowledge."', u'The Second World Summit on the Knowledge Society, held in Chania, Crete, in September 2009, gave special attention to the following topics:\nbusiness and enterprise computing;\ntechnology-enhanced learning;\nsocial and humanistic computing;\nculture, tourism and technology;\ne-government and e-democracy;\ninnovation, sustainable development, and strategic management;\nservice science, management, and engineering;\nintellectual and human capital development;\nICTs for ecology and the green economy;\nfuture prospects for the knowledge society; and\ntechnologies and business models for the creative industries.', u'=== Other uses ===\nPeople of many nations united by common political and cultural traditions, beliefs, or values are sometimes also said to form a society (such as Judeo-Christian, Eastern, and Western).', u'When used in this context, the term is employed as a means of contrasting two or more "societies" whose members represent alternative conflicting and competing worldviews.', u'Some academic, professional, and scientific associations describe themselves as societies (for example, the American Mathematical Society, the American Society of Civil Engineers, or the Royal Society).', u'In some countries, e.g.', u'the United States, France, and Latin America, the term "society\' is used in commerce to denote a partnership between investors or the start of a business.', u'In the United Kingdom, partnerships are not called societies, but co-operatives or mutuals are often known as societies (such as friendly societies and building societies).', u'== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSociety at DMOZ\nDefinition of Society from the OED.', u'Lecture

{'sentences': [u'A city is a large and permanent human settlement.', u'Although there is no agreement on how a city is distinguished from a town in general English language meanings, many cities have a particular administrative, legal, or historical status based on local law.', u'Cities generally have complex systems for sanitation, utilities, land usage, housing, and transportation.', u'The concentration of development greatly facilitates interaction between people and businesses, sometimes benefiting both parties in the process, but it also presents challenges to managing urban growth.', u'A big city or metropolis usually has associated suburbs and exurbs.', u'Such cities are usually associated with metropolitan areas and urban areas, creating numerous business commuters traveling to urban centers for employment.', u'Once a city expands far enough to reach another city, this region can be deemed a conurbation or megalopolis.', u'Damascus is arguably the oldest city in the world.', u'In terms of population, the largest city proper is Shanghai, while the fastest-growing is Dubai.', u'== Origins ==\n\nThere is not enough evidence to assert what conditions gave rise to the first cities.', u'Some theorists have speculated on what they consider suitable pre-conditions and basic mechanisms that might have been important driving forces.', u'The conventional view holds that cities first formed after the Neolithic revolution.', u'The Neolithic revolution brought agriculture, which made denser human populations possible, thereby supporting city development.', u'The advent of farming encouraged hunter-gatherers to abandon nomadic lifestyles and to settle near others who lived by agricultural production.', u'The increased population density encouraged by farming and the increased output of food per unit of land created conditions that seem more suitable for city-like activities.', u'In his book, Cities and Economic Development, Paul Bairoch takes up this position in his argument that agricultural activity appears necessary before true cities can form.', u'According to Vere Gordon Childe, for a settlement to qualify as a city, it must have enough surplus of raw materials to support trade and a relatively large population.', u'Bairoch points out that, due to sparse population densities that would have persisted in pre-Neolithic, hunter-gatherer societies, the amount of land that would be required to produce enough food for subsistence and trade for a large population would make it impossible to control the flow of trade.', u'To illustrate this point, Bairoch offers an example: "Western Europe during the pre-Neolithic, [where] the density must have been less than 0.1 person per square kilometre".', u'Using this population density as a base for calculation, and allotting 10% of food towards surplus for trade and assuming that city dwellers do no farming, he calculates that "...to maintain a city with a population of 1,000, and without taking the cost of transport into account, an area of 100,000 square kilometres would have been required.', u'When the cost of transport is taken into account, the figure rises to 200,000 square kilometres ...".', u'Bairoch noted that this is roughly the size of Great Britain.', u'The urban theorist Jane Jacobs suggests that city formation preceded the birth of agriculture, but this view is not widely accepted.', u'In his book City Economics, Brendan O\'Flaherty asserts "Cities could persist\u2014as they have for thousands of years\u2014only if their advantages offset the disadvantages" (O\'Flaherty 2005, p. 12).', u"O'Flaherty illustrates two similar attracting advantages known as increasing returns to scale and economies of scale, which are concepts usually associated with businesses.", u'Their applications are seen in more basic economic systems as well.', u'Increasing returns to scale occurs when "doubling all inputs more than doubles the output [and] an activity has economies of scale if doubling output less than doubles cost" (O\'Flaherty 2005, pp.', u'572\u2013573).', u'To offer an example of these concepts, O\'Flaherty makes use of "one of the oldest reasons why cities were built: military protection" (O\'Flaherty 2005, p. 13).', u'In this example, the inputs are anything that would be used for protection (e.g., a wall) and the output is the area protected and everything of value contained in it.', u"O'Flaherty then asks that we suppose the protected area is square, and each hectare inside it has the same value of protection.", u"The advantage is expressed as: (O'Flaherty 2005, p. 13)\n(1) \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        =\n        \n          s\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O=s^{2}}\n  , where O is the output (area protected) and s stands for the length of a side.", u'This equation shows that output is proportional to the square of the length of a side.', u'The inputs depend on the length of the perimeter:\n(2) \n  \n    \n      \n        I\n        =\n        4\n        s\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle I=4s}\n  , where I stands for the quantity of inputs.', u'So there are increasing returns to scale:\n(3) \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        =\n        \n          I\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          /\n        \n        16\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O=I^{2}/16}\n  .', u'This equation (solving for \n  \n    \n      \n        s\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle s}\n   in (1) and substituting in (2)) shows that with twice the inputs, you produce quadruple the output.', u'Also, economies of scale:\n(4) \n  \n    \n      \n        I\n        =\n        4\n        \n          O\n          \n            1\n            \n              /\n            \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle I=4O^{1/2}}\n  .', u'This equation (solving for \n  \n    \n      \n        I\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle I}\n   in equation (3)) shows that the same output requires less input.', u'"Cities, then, economize on protection, and so protection against marauding barbarian armies is one reason why people have come together to live in cities ..." (O\'Flaherty 2005, p. 13).', u'Similarly, "Are Cities Dying?', u'", a paper by Harvard economist Edward L. Glaeser, delves into similar reasons for city formation: reduced transport costs for goods, people and ideas.', u'Discussing the benefits of proximity, Glaeser claims that if a city is doubled in size, workers get a ten percent increase in earnings.', u'Glaeser furthers his argument by stating that bigger cities do not pay more for equal productivity than in a smaller city, so it is reasonable to assume that workers become more productive if they move to a city twice the size as they initially worked in.', u'The workers do not benefit much from the ten percent wage increase, because it is recycled back into the higher cost of living in a larger city.', u'They do gain other benefits from living in cities, though.', u'== Geography ==\n\nCity planning has seen many different schemes for how a city should look.', u"The most commonly seen pattern is the grid, used for thousands of years in China, independently invented by Alexander the Great's city planner Dinocrates of Rhodes and favoured by the Romans, while almost a rule in parts of pre-Columbian America.", u'Derry, begun in 1613, was the first planned city in Ireland, with the walls being completed five years later.', u'The central diamond within a walled city with four gates was considered a good design for defence.', u'The grid pattern was widely copied in the colonies of British North America.', u'The ancient Greeks often gave their colonies around the Mediterranean a grid plan.', u'One of the best examples is the city of Priene.', u'This city had different specialised districts, much as is seen in modern city planning today.', u'Fifteen centuries earlier, the Indus Valley Civilisation was using grids in such cities as Mohenjo-Daro.', u'In medieval times there was evidence of a preference for linear planning.', u'Good examples are the cities established by various rulers in the south of France and city expansions in old Dutch and Flemish cities.', u'Grid plans were popular among planners in the 19th century, particularly after the redesign of Paris.', u'They cut through the meandering, organic streets that followed old paths.', u'The United States imposed grid plans in new territories and towns, as the American West was rapidly established, in places such as Salt Lake City and San Francisco.', u'Other forms may include a radial structure, in which main roads converge on a central point.', u'This was often a historic form, the effect of successive growth over long time with concentric traces of town walls and citadels.', u'In more recent history, such forms were supplemented by ring-roads that take traffic around the outskirts of a town.', u'Many Dutch cities are structured this way: a central square surrounded by concentric canals.', u'Every city expansion would imply a new circle (canals together with town walls).', u'In cities such as Amsterdam, Haarlem and also Moscow, this pattern is still clearly visible.', u'== History ==\n\nTowns and cities have a long history, although opinions vary on whether any particular ancient settlement can be considered a city.', u'Cities formed as a result of geographically centralized trade, benefiting the members living in close proximity to others and facilitating interactions including, but not limited to, economics.', u"These interactions generate both positive and negative externalities between others' actions.", u'Benefits include reduced transport costs, exchange of ideas, sharing of natural resources, large local markets, and later in their development, amenities such as running water and sewage disposal.', u'Possible costs would include higher rate of crime, higher mortality rates, higher cost of living, worse pollution, traffic and high commuting times.', u'Cities grow when the benefits of proximity between people and firms are higher than the cost.', u'The first true towns are sometimes considered large settlements where the inhabitants were no longer simply farmers of the surrounding area, but began to take on specialized occupations, and where trade, food storage and power were centralized.', u'In 1950 Gordon Childe attempted to define a historic city with 10 general metrics.', u'These are:\nSize and density of the population should be above normal.', u'Differentiation of the population.', u'Not all residents grow their own food, leading to specialists.', u'Payment of taxes to a deity or king.', u'Monumental public buildings.', u'Those not producing their own food are supported by the king.', u'Systems of recording and practical science.', u'A system of writing.', u'Development of symbolic art.', u'Trade and import of raw materials.', u'Specialist craftsmen from outside the kin-group.', u'This categorisation is descriptive, and it is used as a general touchstone when considering ancient cities, although not all have each of its characteristics.', u'One characteristic that can be used to distinguish a small city from a large town is organized government.', u'A town accomplishes common goals through informal agreements between neighbors or the leadership of a chief.', u'A city has professional administrators, regulations, and some form of taxation (food and other necessities or means to trade for them) to feed the government workers.', u'The governments may be based on heredity, religion, military power, work projects (such as canal building), food distribution, land ownership, agriculture, commerce, manufacturing, finance, or a combination of those.', u'Societies that live in cities are often called civilizations.', u'=== Ancient times ===\n\nThe more complex human societies, called the first civilizations emerged around 3000 BC in the river valleys of Mesopotamia, India, China, and Egypt.', u'An increase in food production led to the significant growth in human population and the rise of cities.', u'The peoples of Southwest Asia and Egypt laid the foundations of Western civilization, they developed cities and struggled with the problems of organised states as they moved from individual communities to larger territorial units and eventually to empires.', u'The Indus Valley Civilization and ancient China are two other areas with major indigenous urban traditions.', u'Among the early Old World cities, Mohenjo-daro of the Indus Valley Civilization in present-day Pakistan, existing from about 2600 BC, was one of the largest, with a population of 50,000 or more.', u'In ancient Greece, beginning in the early 1st millennium BC, there emerged independent city-states that evolved for the first time the notion of citizenship, becoming in the process the archetype of the free city, the polis.', u'The Agora, meaning "gathering place" or "assembly", was the center of athletic, artistic, spiritual and political life of the polis.', u'These Greek city-states reached great levels of prosperity that resulted in an unprecedented cultural boom, that of classical Greece, expressed in architecture, drama, science, mathematics and philosophy, and nurtured in Athens under a democratic government.', u'The Greek Hippodamus of Miletus (c. 407 BC) has been dubbed the "Father of City Planning" for his design of Miletus; the Hippodamian, or grid plan, was the basis for subsequent Greek and Roman cities.', u"In the 4th century BC, Alexander the Great commissioned Dinocrates of Rhodes to lay out his new city of Alexandria, the grandest example of idealized urban planning of the ancient Mediterranean world, where the city's regularity was facilitated by its level site near a mouth of the Nile.", u'This roster of early urban traditions is notable for its diversity.', u'Excavations at early urban sites show that some cities were sparsely populated political capitals, others were trade centers, and still other cities had a primarily religious focus.', u'Some cities had large dense populations, whereas others carried out urban activities in the realms of politics or religion without having large associated populations.', u'Theories that attempt to explain ancient urbanism by a single factor, such as economic benefit, fail to capture the range of variation documented by archaeologists.', u"The growth of the population of ancient civilizations, the formation of ancient empires concentrating political power, and the growth in commerce and manufacturing led to ever greater capital cities and centres of commerce and industry, with Alexandria, Antioch and Seleucia of the Hellenistic civilization, Pataliputra (now Patna) in India, Chang'an (now Xi'an) in China, Carthage, ancient Rome, its eastern successor Constantinople (later Istanbul).", u'Keith Hopkins estimates that ancient Rome had a population of about a million people by the end of the 1st century BC, after growing continually during the 3rd, 2nd, and 1st centuries BC, making it the largest city in the world at the time.', u"Alexandria's population was also close to Rome's population at around the same time, the historian Rostovtzeff estimates a total population close to a million based on a census dated from 32 AD that counted 180,000 adult male citizens in Alexandria.", u'Cities of Late Antiquity underwent transformations as the urban power base shrank and was transferred to the local bishop (see Late Roman Empire).', u'Cities essentially disappeared, earliest in Roman Britain and Germania and latest in the Eastern Roman Empire and Visigothic Spain.', u'In the ancient Americas, early urban traditions developed in the Andes and Mesoamerica.', u'In the Andes, the first urban centers developed in the Norte Chico civilization (also Caral or Caral-Supe civilization), Chavin and Moche cultures, followed by major cities in the Huari, Chimu and Inca cultures.', u'The Norte Chico civilization included as many as 30 major population centers in what is now the Norte Chico region of north-central coastal Peru.', u'It is the oldest known civilization in the Americas, flourishing between the 30th century BC and the 18th century BC.', u'Mesoamerica saw the rise of early urbanism in several cultural regions, including the Preclassic Maya, the Zapotec of Oaxaca, and Teotihuacan in central Mexico.', u'Later cultures such as the Aztec drew on these earlier urban traditions.', u'In the first millennium AD, an urban tradition developed in the Khmer region of Cambodia, where Angkor grew into one of the largest cities (in area) of the world.', u'The closest rival to Angkor, the Mayan city of Tikal in Guatemala, was between 100 and 150 square kilometres (39 and 58 sq mi) in total size.', u'Although its population remains a topic of research and debate, newly identified agricultural systems in the Angkor area may have supported up to one million people.', u'Agriculture was practiced in sub-Saharan Africa since the third millennium BC.', u'Because of this, cities could develop as centers of non-agricultural activity.', u'Exactly when this first happened is still a topic of archeological and historical investigation.', u'Western scholarship has tended to focus on cities in Europe and Mesopotamia, but emerging archeological evidence indicates that urbanization occurred south of the Sahara well before the influence of Arab urban culture.', u'One of the oldest sites documented thus far, Jenn\xe9-Jeno in what is today Mali, has in fact been dated back to the third century BC.', u'According to Roderick and Susan McIntosh, Jenn\xe9-Jeno did not fit into traditional Western conceptions of urbanity as it lacked monumental architecture and a distinctive elite social class, but it should indeed be considered a city based on more a more functional redefinition of urban development.', u'In particular, Jenn\xe9-Jeno featured settlement mounds arranged according to a horizontal, rather than vertical, power hierarchy, and served as a center of specialized production and exhibited functional interdependence with the surrounding hinterland.', u'Archaeological evidence from Jenn\xe9-Jeno, specifically the presence of non-West African glass beads dated from the third century BC to the fourth century AD, indicates that pre-Arabic trade contacts probably existed between Jenn\xe9-Jeno and North Africa.', u'Additionally, other early urban centers in sub-Saharan Africa, dated to around 500 AD, include Awdaghust, Kumbi-Saleh the ancient capital of Ghana, and Maranda a center located on a trade rout between Egypt and Gao.', u'=== Middle Ages ===\n\nWhile David Kessler and Peter Temin consider ancient Rome the largest city before the 19th century, London was the first to exceed a population of 1 million.', u'George Modelski considers medieval Baghdad, with an estimated population of 1.2 million at its peak, the largest city before 19th century London and the first with a population of over one million.', u"Others estimate that Baghdad's population may have been as large as 2 million in the 9th century.", u'From the 9th through the end of the 12th century, the city of Constantinople, capital of the Byzantine Empire, was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe, with a population approaching 1 million.', u'During the European Middle Ages, a town was as much a political entity as a collection of houses.', u'City residence brought freedom from customary rural obligations to lord and community: "Stadtluft macht frei" ("City air makes you free") was a saying in Germany.', u'In Continental Europe cities with a legislature of their own were not unheard of, the laws for towns as a rule other than for the countryside, the lord of a town often being another than for surrounding land.', u'In the Holy Roman Empire, some cities had no other lord than the emperor.', u'In Italy medieval communes had quite a statelike power.', u'In exceptional cases like Venice, Genoa or L\xfcbeck, cities themselves became powerful states, sometimes taking surrounding areas under their control or establishing extensive maritime empires.', u'Similar phenomena existed elsewhere, as in the case of Sakai, which enjoyed a considerable autonomy in late medieval Japan.', u"=== Early modern ===\n\nWhile the city-states, or poleis, of the Mediterranean and Baltic Sea languished from the 16th century, Europe's larger capitals benefited from the growth of commerce following the emergence of an Atlantic trade.", u'By the early 19th century, London had become the largest city in the world with a population of over a million, while Paris rivaled the well-developed regionally traditional capital cities of Baghdad, Beijing, Istanbul and Kyoto.', u'During the Spanish colonization of the Americas the old Roman city concept was extensively used.', u'Cities were founded in the middle of the newly conquered territories, and were bound to several laws about administration, finances and urbanism.', u'Most towns remained far smaller, so that in 1500 only some two dozen places in the world contained more than 100,000 inhabitants.', u'As late as 1700, there were fewer than forty, a figure that rose to 300 in 1900.', u'=== Industrial age ===\n\nThe growth of modern industry from the late 18th century onward led to massive urbanization and the rise of new great cities, first in Europe and then in other regions, as new opportunities brought huge numbers of migrants from rural communities into urban areas.', u'In the United States from 1860 to 1910, the introduction of railroads reduced transportation costs, and large manufacturing centers began to emerge, thus allowing migration from rural to city areas.', u'Cities during this period were deadly places to live in, due to health problems resulting from contaminated water and air, and communicable diseases.', u'In the Great Depression of the 1930s cities were hard hit by unemployment, especially those with a base in heavy industry.', u'In the U.S. urbanization rate increased forty to eighty percent during 1900\u20131990.', u"Today the world's population is slightly over half urban, and continues to urbanize, with roughly a million people moving into cities every 24 hours worldwide.", u'== External effects ==\nModern cities are known for creating their own microclimates.', u'This is due to the large clustering of heat absorbent surfaces that heat up in sunlight and that channel rainwater into underground ducts.', u'Waste and sewage are two major problems for cities, as is air pollution from various forms of combustion, including fireplaces, wood or coal-burning stoves, other heating systems, and internal combustion engines.', u'The impact of cities on places elsewhere, be it hinterlands or places far away, is considered in the notion of city footprinting (ecological footprint).', u'Other negative external effects include health consequences such as communicable diseases, crime, and high traffic and commuting times.', u'Cities cause more interaction with more people than rural areas, leading to a higher probability of contracting contagious diseases.', u'However, many inventions such as inoculations, vaccines, and water filtration systems have also lowered health concerns.', u'Crime is also a concern in the cities.', u'Studies have shown that crime rates in cities are higher and the chance of punishment after getting caught is lower.', u'In cases such as burglary, the higher concentration of people in cities create more items of higher value worth the risk of crime.', u'The high concentration of people also makes using auto mobiles inconvenient and pedestrian traffic is more prominent in metropolitan areas than a rural or suburban one.', u'Cities also generate positive external effects.', u'The close physical proximity facilitates knowledge spillovers, helping people and firms exchange information and generate new ideas.', u'A thicker labor market allows for better skill matching between firms and individuals.', u'Population density enables also sharing of common infrastructure and production facilities, however in very dense cities, increased crowding and waiting times may lead to some negative effects.', u'Cities may have a positive influence on the environment.', u'UN-HABITAT stated in its reports that city living can be the best solution for dealing with the rising population numbers (and thus still be a good approach on dealing with overpopulation) This is because cities concentrate human activity into one place, making the environmental damage on other places smaller.', u'However, this can be achieved only if urban planning is improved and if city services are properly maintained.', u'== Distinction between cities and towns ==\n\nThe difference between towns and cities is differently understood in different parts of the world.', u'Even within the English-speaking world there is no one standard definition of a city: the term may be used either for a town possessing city status; for an urban locality exceeding an arbitrary population size; for a town dominating other towns with particular regional economic or administrative significance.', u'British city status was historically conferred on settlements with a diocesan cathedral; in more recent times towns apply to receive city status at times of national celebration.', u'Larger settlements which are not designated as cities are towns, smaller settlements are villages and very small settlements are called hamlets.', u'In the United States city can be used for much smaller settlements.', u'Historically, city status was a privilege granted by royal letters of patent.', u'The status would allow markets and/or foreign trade, in contrast to towns.', u'Sovereigns could establish cities by decree, e.g.', u'Helsinki, regardless of what was in the location beforehand.', u'Also, with the establishment of federal governments, the new capital could be established from scratch, e.g.', u'Bras\xedlia, without going through organic growth from a village to a town.', u'Although city can refer to an agglomeration including suburban and satellite areas, the term is not usually applied to a conurbation (cluster) of distinct urban places, nor for a wider metropolitan area including more than one city, each acting as a focus for parts of the area.', u'And the word "town" (also "downtown") may mean the center of the city.', u'== Global cities ==\n\nA global city, also known as a world city, is a prominent centre of trade, banking, finance, innovation, and markets.', u'The term "global city", as opposed to megacity, was coined by Saskia Sassen in a seminal 1991 work.', u'Whereas "megacity" refers to any city of enormous size, a global city is one of enormous power or influence.', u'Global cities, according to Sassen, have more in common with each other than with other cities in their host nations.', u'The notion of global cities is rooted in the concentration of power and capabilities within all cities.', u'The city is seen as a container where skills and resources are concentrated: the better able a city is to concentrate its skills and resources, the more successful and powerful the city.', u'This makes the city itself more powerful in the sense that it can influence what is happening around the world.', u"Following this view of cities, it is possible to rank the world's cities hierarchically.", u'Critics of the notion point to the different realms of power and interchange.', u'The term "global city" is heavily influenced by economic factors and, thus, may not account for places that are otherwise significant.', u"One writer, for example argues that the term is 'reductive and skewed':\n\nAgainst those writers who, by emphasizing the importance of financial exchange systems, distinguish a few special cities as 'global cities'\u2014commonly London, Paris, New York and Tokyo\u2014we recognize the uneven global dimensions of all the cities that we study.", u'Los Angeles, the home of Hollywood, is a globalizing city, though perhaps more significantly in cultural than economic terms.', u"And so is Dili globalizing, the small and 'insignificant' capital of Timor Leste\u2014except this time it is predominantly in political terms...", u'In 1995, Kanter argued that successful cities can be identified by three elements: good thinkers (concepts), good makers (competence) or good traders (connections).', u'The interplay of these three elements, Kanter argued, means that good cities are not planned but managed.', u'== Inner city ==\n\nIn Paris, the inner city is the richest part of the metropolitan area, where housing is the most expensive, and where elites and high-income individuals dwell.', u'In the developing world, economic modernization brings poor newcomers from the countryside to build haphazardly at the edge of current settlement (see favelas, shacks and shanty towns).', u'The United States, in particular, has a culture of anti-urbanism that dates back to colonial times.', u'The American City Beautiful architecture movement of the late 19th century was a reaction to perceived urban decay and sought to provide stately civic buildings and boulevards to inspire civic pride in the motley residents of the urban core.', u'Modern anti-urban attitudes are found in the United States in the form of a planning profession that continues to develop land on a low-density suburban basis, where access to amenities, work and shopping is provided almost exclusively by car rather than by foot or transit.', u'There is a growing movement in North America called "New Urbanism" that calls for a return to traditional city planning methods where mixed-use zoning allows people to walk from one type of land-use to another.', u'The idea is that housing, shopping, office space, and leisure facilities are all provided within walking distance of each other, thus reducing the demand for road-space and also improving the efficiency and effectiveness of mass transit.', u'== 21st century ==\n\nThere is a debate about whether technology and instantaneous communications are making cities obsolete, or reinforcing the importance of big cities as centres of the knowledge economy.', u'Knowledge-based development of cities, globalization of innovation networks, and broadband services are driving forces of a new city planning paradigm towards smart cities that use technology and communication to create more efficient agglomerations in terms of competitiveness, innovation, environment, energy, utilities, governance, and delivery of services to the citizen.',

{'sentences': [u'A flag is a piece of fabric (most often rectangular or quadrilateral) with a distinctive design that is used as a symbol, as a signaling device, or as decoration.', u'The term flag is also used to refer to the graphic design employed, and flags have since evolved into a general tool for rudimentary signalling and identification, especially in environments where communication is similarly challenging (such as the maritime environment where semaphore is used).', u'National flags are potent patriotic symbols with varied wide-ranging interpretations, often including strong military associations due to their original and ongoing military uses.', u'Flags are also used in messaging, advertising, or for other decorative purposes.', u'The study of flags is known as vexillology, from the Latin word vexillum, meaning flag or banner.', u"Due to the use of flags by military units, 'flag' is also used as the name of some military units.", u'A flag (Arabic: \u0644\u0648\u0627\u0621) is equivalent to a brigade in Arab countries, and in Spain, a flag (Spanish: bandera) is a battalion-equivalent in the Spanish Legion.', u"== History ==\n\nIn antiquity, field signs or standards were used in warfare that can be categorized as vexilloid or 'flag-like'.", u"Examples include the Sassanid battle standard Derafsh Kaviani, and the standards of the Roman legions such as the eagle of Augustus Caesar's Xth legion, or the dragon standard of the Sarmatians; the latter was let fly freely in the wind, carried by a horseman, but judging from depictions it was more similar to an elongated dragon kite than to a simple flag.", u'During the High Middle Ages flags came to be used primarily as a heraldic device in battle, allowing more easily to identify a knight than only from the heraldic device painted on the shield.', u'Already during the high medieval period, and increasingly during the Late Middle Ages, city states and communes such as those of the Old Swiss Confederacy also began to use flags as field signs.', u'Regimental flags for individual units became commonplace during the Early Modern period.', u'During the peak of the age of sail, beginning in the early 17th century, it was customary (and later a legal requirement) for ships to carry flags designating their nationality; these flags eventually evolved into the national flags and maritime flags of today.', u'Flags also became the preferred means of communications at sea, resulting in various systems of flag signals; see, International maritime signal flags.', u'Use of flags outside of military or naval context begins only with the rise of nationalist sentiment by the end of the 18th century; the earliest national flags date to that period, and during the 19th century it became common for every sovereign state to introduce a national flag.', u'== National flags ==\n\nOne of the most popular uses of a flag is to symbolize a nation or country.', u'Some national flags have been particularly inspirational to other nations, countries, or subnational entities in the design of their own flags.', u'Some prominent examples include:\nThe flag of Denmark, the Dannebrog, is attested in 1478, and is the oldest national flag still in use.', u'It inspired the cross design of the other Nordic countries: Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, and regional Scandinavian flags for the Faroe Islands, \xc5land, Scania and Bornholm, as well as flags for the non-Scandinavian Shetland and Orkney.', u'The flag of the Netherlands is the oldest tricolour.', u"Its three colours of red, white and blue go back to Charlemagne's time, the 9th century.", u'The coastal region of what today is the Netherlands was then known for its cloth in these colours.', u"Maps from the early 16th century already put flags in these colours next to this region, like Texeira's map of 1520.", u'A century before that, during the 15th century, the three colours were mentioned as the coastal signals for this area, with the 3 bands straight or diagonal, single or doubled.', u"As state flag it first appeared around 1572 as the Prince's Flag in orange\u2013white\u2013blue.", u'Soon the more famous red\u2013white\u2013blue began appearing, becoming the prevalent version from around 1630.', u'Orange made a come back during the civil war of the late 18th century, signifying the orangist or pro-stadtholder party.', u'During WW2 the pro-nazi NSB used it.', u'Any symbolism has been added later to the three colours, although the orange comes from the House of Orange-Nassau.', u'Surprisingly, this use of orange comes from Nassau, which today uses orange-blue, not from Orange, which today uses red-blue.', u'However, the usual way to show the link with the House of Orange-Nassau is the orange pennant above the red-white-blue.', u"It's said that the Dutch Tricolour has inspired many flags but most notably those of Russia, New York City, and South Africa (the 1928\u201394 flag as well the current flag).", u'As the probable inspiration for the Russian flag, it is the source too for the Pan-Slavic colours red, white and blue, adopted by many Slavic states and peoples as their symbols.', u'Examples: Slovakia, Serbia, and Slovenia.', u'The national flag of France was designed in 1794.', u"As a forerunner of revolution, France's tri-colour flag style has been adopted by other nations.", u'Examples: Italy, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ireland, Haiti, Romania, Mexico, etc.', u'The Union Flag (Union Jack) of the United Kingdom is the most commonly used.', u'British colonies typically flew a flag based on one of the ensigns based on this flag, and many former colonies have retained the design to acknowledge their cultural history.', u'Examples: Australia, Fiji, New Zealand, Tuvalu, and also the Canadian provinces of Manitoba, Ontario and British Columbia, and the American state of Hawaii; see commons:Flags based on British ensigns.', u'The flag of the United States is nicknamed The Stars and Stripes or Old Glory.', u'Some nations imitated this flag so as to symbolize their similarity to the United States and/or the American Revolution.', u'Examples: Liberia, Chile, Uruguay, Taiwan (ROC), Malaysia and the French region of Brittany.', u'Ethiopia was seen as a model by emerging African states of the 1950s and 1960s, as it was one of the oldest independent states in Africa.', u"Accordingly, its flag became the source of the Pan-African colours, or 'Rasta colours'.", u'Examples: Benin, Togo, Senegal, Ghana, Mali, Guinea.', u'The flag of Turkey, which is very similar to the last flag of the old Ottoman Empire, has been an inspiration for the flag designs of many other Muslim nations.', u'During the time of the Ottomans the crescent began to be associated with Islam and this is reflected on the flags of Algeria, Azerbaijan, Comoros, Libya, Mauritania, Pakistan and Tunisia.', u'The Pan-Arab colours, green, white, red and black, are derived from the flag of the Great Arab Revolt as seen on the flags of Jordan, Libya, Kuwait, Sudan, Syria, the United Arab Emirates, Western Sahara, Egypt, Iraq, Yemen and Palestine.', u"The Soviet flag, with its golden symbols of the hammer and sickle on a red field, was an inspiration to flags of other communist states, such as East Germany, People's Republic of China, Vietnam, Angola, Afghanistan (1978\u20131980) and Mozambique.", u'The flag of Venezuela, created by Francisco de Miranda to represent the independence movement in Venezuela that later gave birth to the "Gran Colombia", inspired the flags of Colombia, Ecuador, and the Federal Territories in Malaysia, all sharing three bands of yellow, blue and red with the flag of Venezuela.', u"The flag of Argentina, created by Manuel Belgrano during the war of independence, was the inspiration for the United Provinces of Central America's flag, which in turn was the origin for the flags of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua.", u'Flags of Native American nations in the United States are common and many tribes have chosen a flag as their symbol of choice.', u'National flag designs are often used to signify nationality in other forms, such as flag patches.', u'=== Civil flags ===\n\nA civil flag is a version of the national flag that is flown by civilians on non-government installations or craft.', u'The use of civil flags was more common in the past, in order to denote buildings or ships that were not manned by the military.', u"In some countries the civil flag is the same as the war flag or state flag, but without the coat of arms, such as in the case of Spain, and in others it's an alteration of the war flag.", u'=== War flags ===\n\nSeveral countries (including the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union) have had unique flags flown by their armed forces, rather than the national flag.', u"Other countries' armed forces (such as those of the United States or Switzerland) use their standard national flag.", u"The Philippines' armed forces may use their standard national flag, but during times of war the flag is turned upside down.", u"Bulgaria's flag is also turned upside down during times of war.", u"These are also considered war flags, though the terminology only applies to the flag's military usage.", u"Large versions of the war flag flown on the warships of countries' navies are known as battle ensigns.", u'In war waving a white flag is a banner of truce or surrender.', u'Four distinctive African flags currently in the collection of the National Maritime Museum in Britain were flown in action by Itsekiri ships under the control of Nana Olomu during conflict in the late 19th century.', u"One is the flag generally known as the Benin flag and one is referred to as Nana Olomu's flag.", u'=== International flags ===\nAmong international flags are the Flag of the United Nations, the Olympic flag, and the Paralympic flag.', u'== At sea ==\n\nFlags are particularly important at sea, where they can mean the difference between life and death, and consequently where the rules and regulations for the flying of flags are strictly enforced.', u'A national flag flown at sea is known as an ensign.', u'A courteous, peaceable merchant ship or yacht customarily flies its ensign (in the usual ensign position), together with the flag of whatever nation it is currently visiting at the mast (known as a courtesy flag).', u"To fly one's ensign alone in foreign waters, a foreign port or in the face of a foreign warship traditionally indicates a willingness to fight, with cannon, for the right to do so.", u'As of 2009, this custom is still taken seriously by many naval and port authorities and is readily enforced in many parts of the world by boarding, confiscation and other civil penalties.', u'In some countries yacht ensigns are different from merchant ensigns in order to signal that the yacht is not carrying cargo that requires a customs declaration.', u'Carrying commercial cargo on a boat with a yacht ensign is deemed to be smuggling in many jurisdictions.', u'There is a system of international maritime signal flags for numerals and letters of the alphabet.', u'Each flag or pennant has a specific meaning when flown individually.', u'As well, semaphore flags can be used to communicate on an ad hoc basis from ship to ship over short distances.', u"Traditionally, a vessel flying under the courtesy flag of a specific nation, regardless of the vessel's country of registry, is considered to be operating under the law of her 'host' nation.", u'Another category of maritime flag flown by some United States Government ships is the distinguishing mark.', u'Although the United States Coast Guard has its own service ensign, all other U.S. Government ships fly the national ensign their service ensign, following United States Navy practice.', u"To distinguish themselves from ships of the Navy, such ships historically have flown their parent organisation's flag from a forward mast as a distinguishing mark.", u'Today, for example, commissioned ships of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) fly the NOAA flag as a distinguishing mark.', u'== Shapes and designs ==\n\nFlags are usually rectangular in shape (often in the ratio 2:3, 1:2, or 3:5), but may be of any shape or size that is practical for flying, including square, triangular, or swallow tailed.', u'A more unusual flag shape is that of the flag of Nepal, which is in the shape of two stacked triangles.', u'Other unusual flag shapes include the flag of Ohio and the flag of Tampa.', u"Many flags are dyed through and through to be inexpensive to manufacture, such that the reverse side is the mirror image of the obverse (front) side, generally the side displayed when the flag is flying from the observer's point of view from left, the side of the pole, to right.", u'This presents two possibilities:\nIf the design is symmetrical in an axis parallel to the flag pole, obverse and reverse will be identical despite the mirror-reversal, such as the Indian Flag or Canadian Flag\nIf not, the obverse and reverse will present two variants of the same design, one with the hoist on the left (usually considered the obverse side, the other with the hoist on the right (usually considered the reverse side of the flag).', u'This is very common and usually not disturbing if there is no text in the design.', u'Some complex flag designs are not intended for through and through implementation, requiring separate obverse and reverse sides if made correctly.', u"In these cases there is a design element (usually text) which is not symmetric and should be read in the same direction, regardless of whether the hoist is to the viewer's left or right.", u'These cases can be divided into two types:\nThe same (asymmetric) design may be duplicated on both sides.', u"Such flags can be manufactured by creating two identical through and through flags and then sewing them back to back, though this can affect the resulting combination's responsiveness to the wind.", u'Depictions of such flags may be marked with the symbol , indicating the reverse is congruent to (rather than a mirror image of) the obverse.', u'Rarely, the reverse design may differ, in whole or in part, from that of the obverse.', u'Examples of flags whose reverse differs from the obverse include the flag of Paraguay, the flag of Oregon, and the historical flag of the Soviet Union.', u'Depictions of such flags may be marked with the symbol .', u'Common designs on flags include crosses, stripes, and divisions of the surface, or field, into bands or quarters\u2014patterns and principles mainly derived from heraldry.', u'A heraldic coat of arms may also be flown as a banner of arms, as is done on both the state flag of Maryland and the flag of Kiribati.', u'The de jure flag of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi, which consisted of a rectangular field of green, was for a long period the only national flag using a single colour and no design or insignia.', u'However, other historical states have also used flags without designs or insignia, such as the Soviet Republic of Hungary, whose flag was a plain field of red.', u'Colours are normally described with common names, such as "red", but may be further specified using colourimetry.', u'The largest flag flown from a flagpole worldwide, according to Guinness World Records, is the flag of Mexico flown in Piedras Negras, Mexico.', u'This flag was about 2,058 m2 (22,150 sq ft).', u'The largest flag ever made was the flag of Qatar; the flag, which measures at 101,978 m2 (1,097,680 sq ft), was completed in December 2013 in Doha.', u'=== Parts of a flag ===\n\nThe general parts of a flag are: canton\u2014the upper inner section of the flag; field or ground\u2014the entire flag except the canton, and the field and hoist ends; fly end\u2014the furthest edge from the hoist end; and hoist end\u2014the edge used to attach the flag to the hoist.', u'=== Vertical flags ===\nVertical flags are sometimes used in lieu of the standard horizontal flag in central and eastern Europe, particularly in the German-speaking countries.', u'This practice came about because the relatively brisk wind needed to display horizontal flags is not common in these countries.', u'The standard horizontal flag (no.', u'1 in the preceding illustration) is nonetheless the form most often used even in these countries.', u'The vertical flag (German: Hochformatflagge or Knatterflagge; no.', u'2) is a vertical form of the standard flag.', u"The flag's design may remain unchanged (No.", u'2a) or it may change, e.g.', u'by changing horizontal stripes to vertical ones (no.', u'2b).', u'If the flag carries an emblem, it may remain centered or may be shifted slightly upwards.', u'The vertical flag for hoisting from a beam (German: Auslegerflagge or Galgenflagge; no.', u'3) is additionally attached to a horizontal beam, ensuring that it is fully displayed even if there is no wind.', u'The vertical flag for hoisting from a horizontal pole (German: H\xe4ngeflagge; no.', u'4) is hoisted from a horizontal pole, normally attached to a building.', u'The topmost stripe on the horizontal version of the flag faces away from the building.', u'The vertical flag for hoisting from a crossbar or banner (German: Bannerflagge; no.', u'5) is firmly attached to a horizontal crossbar from which it is hoisted, either by a vertical pole (no.', u'5a) or a horizontal one (no.', u'5b).', u'The topmost stripe on the horizontal version of the flag normally faces to the left.', u'== Religious flags ==\n\nFlags can play many different roles in religion.', u'In Buddhism, prayer flags are used, usually in sets of five differently coloured flags.', u'Many national flags and other flags include religious symbols such as the cross, the crescent, or a reference to a patron saint.', u'Flags are also adopted by religious groups and flags such as the Jain flag and the Christian flag are used to represent a whole religion.', u'== Linguistic flags ==\n\nAs languages rarely have a flag designed to represent them, it is a common but unofficial practice to use national flags to identify them.', u'The practice is deprecated because it is often considered insulting and because flags tend to evoke feelings other than the intended meaning.', u'Examples of such use include:\nrepresenting language skills of an individual, like a staff member of a company\ndisplaying available languages on a multilingual website or software.', u'Though this can be done in an uncontroversial manner in some cases, this can easily lead to some problems for certain languages:\nlanguages generating language secessionism, such as Serbo-Croatian which since the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991, has lost its unitary codification and its official unitary status and is now divided into four official languages: Croatian language, Bosnian language, Serbian language and the Montenegrin language\nlanguages spoken in more than one country, such as English or Arabic.', u'In this second case, common solutions include symbolising these languages by:\nthe flag of the country where the language originated\nthe flag of the country having the largest number of native speakers\na mixed flag of the both (when this is not the same)\nthe flag of the country most identified with that language in a specific region (e.g.', u'Portuguese Language: Flag of Portugal in Europe and Flag of Brazil in South America).', u'A Portugal-Brazil mixed flag, usually divided diagonally, is also a possibility.', u'Thus, on the Internet, it is common to see the English language associated with the flag of the United Kingdom, or sometimes the flag of England, the flag of the United States or a U.S.-UK mixed flag, usually divided diagonally.', u'== In sports ==\nBecause of their ease of signalling and identification, flags are often used in sports.', u'In association football, linesmen carry small flags along the touch lines.', u'They use the flags to indicate to the referee potential infringements of the laws, or who is entitled to possession of the ball that has gone out of the field of play, or, most famously, raising the flag to indicate an offside offence.', u'Officials called touch judges use flags for similar purposes in both codes of rugby.', u'In American and Canadian football, referees use penalty flags to indicate that a foul has been committed in game play.', u'The phrase used for such an indication is flag on the play.', u'The flag itself is a small, weighted handkerchief, tossed on the field at the approximate point of the infraction; the intent is usually to sort out the details after the current play from scrimmage has concluded.', u'In American football, the flag is usually yellow; in Canadian football, it is usually orange.', u'In the National Football League, coaches also use red challenge flags to indicate that they wish to contest a ruling on the field.', u'In yacht racing, flags are used to communicate information from the race committee boat to the racers.', u'Different flags hoisted from the committee boat may communicate a false start, changes in the course, a cancelled race, or other important information.', u'Racing boats themselves may also use flags to symbolize a protest or distress.', u'The flags are often part of the nautical alphabetic system of International maritime signal flags, in which 26 different flags designate the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet.', u'In auto and motorcycle racing, racing flags are used to communicate with drivers.', u'Most famously, a checkered flag of black and white squares indicates the end of the race, and victory for the leader.', u'A yellow flag is used to indicate caution requiring slow speed and a red flag requires racers to stop immediately.', u'A black flag is used to indicate penalties.', u'In addition, fans of almost all sports wave flags in the stands to indicate their support for the participants.', u'Many sports teams have their own flags, and, in individual sports, fans will indicate their support for a player by waving the flag of his or her home country.', u"Capture the flag is a popular children's sport.", u'In Gaelic football and Hurling a green flag is used to indicate a goal while a white flag is used to indicate a point\nIn Australian rules football, the goal umpire will wave two flags to indicate a goal (worth six points) and a single flag to indicate a behind (worth one point).', u'For safety, dive flags indicate the locations of underwater scuba divers or that diving operations are being conducted in the vicinity.', u'In water sports such as Wakeboarding and Water-Skiing, an orange flag is held in between runs to indicate someone is in the water.', u'In golf, the hole is almost always marked with a flag.', u'The flagpole is designed to fit centered within the base of the hole and is removable.', u'Many courses will use colour-coded flags to determine a hole location at the front, middle or rear of the green.', u'However colour-coded flags are not used in the professional tours.', u'(A rare example of a golf course that does not use flags to mark the hole is the East Course of Merion Golf Club, which instead uses flagpoles topped by wicker baskets.)', u'Flag poles with flags of all shapes and sizes are used by marching bands, drum corps, and winter guard teams use flags as a method of visual enhancement in performances.', u'== Diplomatic flags ==\n\nSome countries use diplomatic flags, such as the United Kingdom(Image of the Embassy flag) and the Kingdom of Thailand(Image of the Embassy flag)\n\n\n== In politics ==\n\nSocial and political movements have adopted flags, to increase their visibility and as a unifying symbol.', u'The socialist movement uses red flags to represent their cause.', u'The anarchist movement has a variety of different flags, but the primary flag associated with them is the black flag.', u'In the Spanish civil war, the anarchists used the red-and-black bisected flag.', u'In the 20th century, the rainbow flag was adopted as a symbol of the LGBT social movements.', u"Bisexual and transgender pride flags were later designed, in an attempt to emulate the rainbow flag's success.", u'Some of these political flags have become national flags, such as the red flag of the Soviet Union and national socialist banners for Nazi Germany.', u'The present Flag of Portugal is based on what had been the political flag of the Portuguese Republican Party previous to the 5 October 1910 revolution which brought this party to power.', u"== Vehicle flags ==\nFlags are often representative of an individual's affinity or allegiance to a country, team or business and can be presented in various ways.", u"A popular trend that has surfaced revolves around the idea of the 'mobile' flag in which an individual displays their particular flag of choice on their vehicle.", u'These items are commonly referred to as car flags and are usually manufactured from high strength polyester material and are attached to a vehicle via a polypropylene pole and clip window attachment.', u'== Swimming flags ==\n\nIn Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom a pair of red/yellow flags is used to mark the limits of the bathing area on a beach, usually guarded by surf lifesavers.', u'If the beach is closed, the poles of the flags are crossed.', u'The flags are coloured with a red triangle and a yellow triangle making a rectangular flag, or a red rectangle over a yellow rectangle.', u'On many Australian beaches there is a slight variation with beach condition signaling.', u'A red flag signifies a closed beach (in the UK also other dangers), yellow signifies strong current or difficult swimming conditions, and green represents a beach safe for general swimming.', u'In Ireland, a red and yellow flag indicates that it is safe to swim; a red flag that it is unsafe; and no flag indicates that there are no lifeguards on duty.', u'Blue flags may also be used away from the yellow-red lifesaver area to designate a zone for surfboarding and other small, non-motorised watercraft.', u'Reasons for closing the beach include:\ndangerous rip\nhurricane warning\nno lifeguards in attendance\noverpolluted water\nsharks\ntsunami\nwaves too strong\nA surf flag exists, divided into four quadrants.', u'The top left and bottom right quadrants are black, and the remaining area is white.', u'Signal flag "India" (a black circle on a yellow square) is frequently used to denote a "blackball" zone where surfboards cannot be used but other water activities are permitted.', u'== Railway flags ==\nRailways use a number of coloured flags.', u'When used as wayside signals they usually use the following meanings (exact meanings are set by the individual railroad company):\nred = stop\nyellow = proceed with care\ngreen or white = proceed.', u'a flag of any colour waved vigorously means stop\na blue flag on the side of a locomotive means that it should not be moved because someone is working on it (or on the train attached to it).', u'A blue flag on a track means that nothing on that track should be moved.', u'The flag can only be removed by the person or group that placed it.', u'In the railway dominated steel industry this principle of "blue flag and tag" was extended to all operations at Bethlehem Steel, Lackawanna, NY.', u'If a man went inside a large machine or worked on an electrical circuit for example, his blue flag and tag was sacrosanct.', u'The "Lock Out/Tag Out" practice is similar and now used in other industries to comply with safety regulations.', u'At night, the flags are replaced with lanterns showing the same colours.', u'Flags displayed on the front of a moving locomotive are an acceptable replacement for classification lights and usually have the following meanings (exact meanings are set by the individual railroad company):\nwhite = extra (not on the timetable)\ngreen = another section following\nred = last section\nAdditionally, a railroad brakeman will typically carry a red flag to make his or her hand signals more visible to the engineer.', u'Railway signals are a development of railway flags.', u'== Flagpoles ==\n\nA flagpole, flagmast, flagstaff, or staff can be a simple support made of wood or metal.', u'If it is taller than can be easily reached to raise the flag, a cord is used, looping around a pulley at the top of the pole with the ends tied at the bottom.', u'The flag is fixed to one lower end of the cord, and is then raised by pulling on the other end.', u'The cord is then tightened and tied to the pole at the bottom.', u'The pole is usually topped by a flat plate or ball called a "truck" (originally meant to keep a wooden pole from splitting) or a finial in a more complex shape.', u'Very high flagpoles may require more complex support structures than a simple pole, such as a guyed mast.', u'Dwajasthambam are flagpoles commonly found at the entrances of South Indian Hindu temples.', u'=== Record heights ===\n\nSince 23 September 2014, the tallest free-standing flagpole in the world is the Jeddah Flagpole in Saudi Arabia with a height of 171 m (561 ft), beating the formerly record holding Dushanbe Flagpole in Tajikistan (height: 165 m, 541 ft), National Flagpole in Azerbaijan (height: 162 m, 531 ft) and the North Korean flagpole at Kij\u014fng-dong (height: 160 m, 520 ft).', u'The tallest flagpole in the United Kingdom from 1959 until 2013 stood in Kew Gardens.', u'It was made from a Canadian Douglas-fir tree and was 68.5 m (225 ft) in height.', u'The current tallest flagpole in the United States (and the tallest containing an American flag) is a 400 ft (120 m) pole completed near Memorial Day 2014 and custom-made with a large 11 feet (3.4 m) base in concrete by wind turbine manufacturer Broadwind Energy, which is situated on the north side of the Acuity Insurance headquarters campus along Interstate 43 in Sheboygan, Wisconsin and is visible from Cedar Grove.', u'The pole will hold a 220-pound flag for pleasant conditions and a thicker 350-pound flag for harsh weather.', u'Acuity had made three separate attempts in the 2000s at the tallest flagpole which were all removed due to collapses or wind-swaying, following the example of a nearby Perkins location which had put up a flag visible on their

{'sentences': [u'A battle is a combat in warfare between two or more armed forces, or combatants.', u'A war sometimes consists of many battles.', u'Battles generally are well defined in duration, area, and force commitment.', u'Wars and military campaigns are guided by strategy, whereas battles take place on a level of planning and execution known as operational mobility.', u'German strategist Carl von Clausewitz stated that "the employment of battles ... to achieve the object of war" was the essence of strategy.', u'== Etymology ==\nBattle is a loanword from the Old French bataille, first attested in 1297, from Late Latin battualia, meaning "exercise of soldiers and gladiators in fighting and fencing", from Late Latin (taken from Germanic) battuere "beat", from which the English word battery is also derived via Middle English batri.', u'== Characteristics ==\nThe defining characteristic of the fight as a concept in Military science has been a dynamic one through the course of military history, changing with the changes in the organisation, employment and technology of military forces.', u'While the English military historian Sir John Keegan suggested an ideal definition of battle as "something which happens between two armies leading to the moral then physical disintegration of one or the other of them", the origins and outcomes of battles can rarely be summarized so neatly.', u'In general a battle during the 20th century was, and continues to be, defined by the combat between opposing forces representing major components of total forces committed to a military campaign, used to achieve specific military objectives.', u'Where the duration of the battle is longer than a week, it is often for reasons of staff operational planning called an operation.', u'Battles can be planned, encountered, or forced by one force on the other when the latter is unable to withdraw from combat.', u'A battle always has as its purpose the reaching of a mission goal by use of military force.', u'A victory in the battle is achieved when one of the opposing sides forces the other to abandon its mission, or to surrender its forces, or routs the other, i.e., forces it to retreat or renders it militarily ineffective for further combat operations.', u'However, a battle may end in a Pyrrhic victory, which ultimately favors the defeated party.', u'If no resolution is reached in a battle, it can result in a stalemate.', u'A conflict in which one side is unwilling to reach a decision by a direct battle using conventional warfare often becomes an insurgency.', u'Until the 19th century the majority of battles were of short duration, many lasting a part of a day.', u'(The Battle of Nations (1813) and the Battle of Gettysburg (1863) were exceptional in lasting three days.)', u'This was mainly due to the difficulty of supplying armies in the field, or conducting night operations.', u'The means of prolonging a battle was typically by employment of siege warfare.', u'Improvements in transportation and the sudden evolving of trench warfare, with its siege-like nature during World War I in the 20th century, lengthened the duration of battles to days and weeks.', u'This created the requirement for unit rotation to prevent combat fatigue, with troops preferably not remaining in a combat area of operations for more than a month.', u'Trench warfare had become largely obsolete in conflicts between advanced armies by the start of the Second World War.', u'The use of the term "battle" in military history has led to its misuse when referring to almost any scale of combat, notably by strategic forces involving hundreds of thousands of troops that may be engaged in either a single battle at one time (Battle of Leipzig) or multiple operations (Battle of Kursk).', u'The space a battle occupies depends on the range of the weapons of the combatants.', u'A "battle" in this broader sense may be of long duration and take place over a large area, as in the case of the Battle of Britain or the Battle of the Atlantic.', u'Until the advent of artillery and aircraft, battles were fought with the two sides within sight, if not reach, of each other.', u'The depth of the battlefield has also increased in modern warfare with inclusion of the supporting units in the rear areas; supply, artillery, medical personnel etc.', u'often outnumber the front-line combat troops.', u"Battles are, on the whole, made up of a multitude of individual combats, skirmishes and small engagements within the context of which the combatants will usually only experience a small part of the events of the battle's entirety.", u"To the infantryman, there may be little to distinguish between combat as part of a minor raid or as a major offensive, nor is it likely that he anticipates the future course of the battle; few of the British infantry who went over the top on the first day on the Somme, July 1, 1916, would have anticipated that they would be fighting the same battle in five months' time.", u'Conversely, some of the Allied infantry who had just dealt a crushing defeat to the French at the Battle of Waterloo fully expected to have to fight again the next day (at the Battle of Wavre).', u'== Battlespace ==\n\nBattlespace is a unified strategy to integrate and combine armed forces for the military theatre of operations, including air, information, land, sea and space.', u'It includes the environment, factors and conditions that must be understood to successfully apply combat power, protect the force, or complete the mission.', u'This includes enemy and friendly armed forces; facilities; weather; terrain; and the electromagnetic spectrum within the operational areas and areas of interest.', u'== Factors ==\nBattles are decided by various factors.', u'The number and quality of combatants and equipment, the skill of the commanders of each army, and the terrain advantages are among the most prominent factors.', u'A unit may charge with high morale but less discipline and still emerge victorious.', u'This tactic was effectively used by the early French Revolutionary Armies.', u'Weapons and armour can be a decisive factor.', u'On many occasions armies have achieved victories largely owing to the employment of more advanced weapons than those of their opponents.', u'An extreme example was in the Battle of Omdurman, in which a large army of Sudanese Mahdists armed in a traditional manner were destroyed by an Anglo-Egyptian force equipped with Maxim guns.', u'On some occasions, simple weapons employed in an unorthodox fashion have proven advantageous, as with the Swiss pikemen who gained many victories through their ability to transform a traditionally defensive weapon into an offensive one.', u'Likewise, the Zulus in the early 19th century were victorious in battles against their rivals in part because they adopted a new kind of spear, the iklwa.', u'Even so, forces with inferior weapons have still emerged victorious at times, for example in the Wars of Scottish Independence and in the First Italo\u2013Ethiopian War.', u'Discipline within the troops is often of greater importance; at the Battle of Alesia, the Romans were greatly outnumbered but won because of superior training.', u'Battles can also be determined by terrain.', u'Capturing high ground, for example, has been the central strategy in innumerable battles.', u'An army that holds the high ground forces the enemy to climb, and thus wear themselves down.', u'Areas of dense vegetation, such as jungles and forest, act as force-multipliers, of benefit to inferior armies.', u'Arguably, terrain is of less importance in modern warfare, due to the advent of aircraft, though terrain is still vital for camouflage, especially for guerrilla warfare.', u'Generals and commanders also play a decisive role during combat.', u'Hannibal, Julius Caesar, Khalid ibn Walid and Napoleon Bonaparte were all skilled generals and, consequently, their armies were extremely successful.', u'An army that can trust the commands of their leaders with conviction in its success invariably has a higher morale than an army that doubts its every move.', u'The British in the naval Battle of Trafalgar, for example, owed its success to the reputation of celebrated admiral Lord Nelson.', u'== Types ==\n\nBattles can be fought on land, at sea and, in the modern age, in the air.', u'Naval battles have occurred since before the 5th century BC.', u'Air battles have been far less common, due to their late conception, the most prominent being the Battle of Britain in 1940.', u'However, since the Second World War land or sea battles have come to rely on air support.', u'Indeed, during the Battle of Midway, five aircraft carriers were sunk without either fleet coming into direct contact.', u'There are numerous types of battles:\nA battle of encounter (or encounter battle) is a meeting engagement where the opposing sides collide in the field without either having prepared their attack or defence.', u"A battle of attrition aims to inflict losses on an enemy that are less sustainable compared to one's own losses.", u'These need not be greater numerical losses \u2013 if one side is much more numerous than the other than pursuing a strategy based on attrition can work even if casualties on both sides are about equal.', u'Many battles of the Western Front in the First World War were intentionally (Verdun) or unintentionally (Somme) attrition battles.', u"A battle of breakthrough aims to pierce the enemy's defences, thereby exposing the vulnerable flanks which can be turned.", u'A battle of encirclement\u2014the Kesselschlacht of the German Blitzkrieg\u2014surrounds the enemy in a pocket.', u'A battle of envelopment involves an attack on one or both flanks; the classic example being the double-envelopment of the Battle of Cannae.', u'A battle of annihilation is one in which the defeated party is destroyed in the field, such as the French fleet at the Battle of the Nile.', u'Battles frequently do not fit one particular type perfectly, and are usually hybrids of different types listed above.', u'A decisive battle is one of particular importance; often by bringing hostilities to an end, such as the Battle of Hastings or the Battle of Hattin, or as a turning point in the fortunes of the belligerents, such as the Battle of Stalingrad.', u'A decisive battle can have political as well as military impact, changing the balance of power or boundaries between countries.', u"The concept of the decisive battle became popular with the publication in 1851 of Edward Creasy's The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World.", u'British military historians J.F.C.', u'Fuller (The Decisive Battles of the Western World) and B.H.', u"Liddell Hart (Decisive Wars of History), among many others, have written books in the style of Creasy's work.", u'=== Land ===\nThere is an obvious difference in the way battles have been fought throughout time.', u'Early battles were probably fought between rival hunting bands as disorganized mobs.', u'However, during the Battle of Megiddo, the first reliably documented battle in the fifteenth century BC, actual discipline was instilled in both armies.', u'However, during the many wars of the Roman Empire, barbarians continued using mob tactics.', u'As the Age of Enlightenment dawned, armies began to fight in highly disciplined lines.', u'Each would follow the orders from their officers and fight as a single unit instead of individuals.', u'Each army was successively divided into regiments, battalions, companies, and platoons.', u'These armies would march, line up, and fire in divisions.', u'Native Americans, on the other hand, did not fight in lines, utilizing instead guerrilla tactics.', u'American colonists and European forces continued using disciplined lines, continuing into the American Civil War.', u'A new style, during World War I, known as trench warfare, developed nearly half a century later.', u'This also led to radio for communication between battalions.', u'Chemical warfare also emerged with the use of poisonous gas during World War I.', u'By World War II, the use of the smaller divisions, platoons and companies became much more important as precise operations became vital.', u'Instead of the locked trench warfare of World War I, during World War II, a dynamic network of battles developed where small groups encountered other platoons.', u'As a result, elite squads became much more recognized and distinguishable.', u'Maneuver warfare also developed with an astonishing pace with the advent of the tank, replacing the archaic cannons of the Enlightenment Age.', u'Artillery has since gradually replaced the use of frontal troops.', u'Modern battles now continue to resemble those of World War II, though prominent innovations have been added.', u'Indirect combat through the use of aircraft and missiles now constitutes a large portion of wars in place of battles, where battles are now mostly reserved for capturing cities.', u'=== Naval ===\n\nOne significant difference of modern naval battles as opposed to earlier forms of combat is the use of marines, which introduced amphibious warfare.', u'Today, a marine is actually an infantry regiment that sometimes fights solely on land and is no longer tied to the navy.', u'A good example of an old naval battle is the Battle of Salamis.', u'Most ancient naval battles were fought by fast ships using the battering ram to sink opposing fleets or steer close enough for boarding in hand-to-hand combat.', u'Troops were often used to storm enemy ships as used by Romans and pirates.', u'This tactic was usually used by civilizations that could not beat the enemy with ranged weaponry.', u'Another invention in the late Middle Ages was the use of Greek fire by the Byzantines, which was used to set enemy fleets on fire.', u'Empty demolition ships utilized the tactic to crash into opposing ships and set it afire with an explosion.', u'After the invention of cannons, naval warfare became useful as support units for land warfare.', u'During the 19th century, the development of mines led to a new type of naval warfare.', u'The ironclad, first used in the American Civil War, resistant to cannons, soon made the wooden ship obsolete.', u'The invention of military submarines, during World War I, brought naval warfare to both above and below the surface.', u'With the development of military aircraft during World War II, battles were fought in the sky as well as below the ocean.', u'Aircraft carriers have since become the central unit in naval warfare, acting as a mobile base for lethal aircraft.', u'=== Aerial ===\nAlthough the use of aircraft has for the most part always been used as a supplement to land or naval engagements, since their first major military use in World War I aircraft have increasingly taken on larger roles in warfare.', u'During World War I, the primary use was for reconnaissance, and small-scale bombardment.', u'Aircraft began becoming much more prominent in the Spanish Civil War and especially World War II.', u'Aircraft design began specializing, primarily into two types: bombers, which carried explosive payloads to bomb land targets or ships; and fighter-interceptors, which were used to either intercept incoming aircraft or to escort and protect bombers (engagements between fighter aircraft were known as dog fights).', u'Some of the more notable aerial battles in this period include the Battle of Britain and the Battle of Midway.', u'Another important use of aircraft came with the development of the helicopter, which first became heavily used during the Vietnam War, and still continues to be widely used today to transport and augment ground forces.', u'Today, direct engagements between aircraft are rare \u2013 the most modern fighter-interceptors carry much more extensive bombing payloads, and are used to bomb precision land targets, rather than to fight other aircraft.', u'Anti-aircraft batteries are used much more extensively to defend against incoming aircraft than interceptors.', u'Despite this, aircraft today are much more extensively used as the primary tools for both army and navy, as evidenced by the prominent use of helicopters to transport and support troops, the use of aerial bombardment as the "first strike" in many engagements, and the replacement of the battleship with the aircraft carrier as the center of most modern navies.', u'== Naming ==\n\nBattles are usually named after some feature of the battlefield geography, such as the name of a town, forest or river, commonly prefixed "Battle of...".', u'Occasionally battles are named after the date on which they took place, such as The Glorious First of June.', u'In the Middle Ages it was considered important to settle on a suitable name for a battle which could be used by the chroniclers.', u'For example, after Henry V of England defeated a French army on October 25, 1415, he met with the senior French herald and they agreed to name the battle after the nearby castle and so it was called the Battle of Agincourt.', u'In other cases, the sides adopted different names for the same battle, such as the Battle of Gallipoli which is known in Turkey as the Battle of \xc7anakkale.', u'During the American Civil War, the Union tended to name the battles after the nearest watercourse, such as the Battle of Wilsons Creek and the Battle of Stones River, whereas the Confederates favoured the nearby towns, as in the Battles of Chancellorsville and Murfreesboro.', u'Occasionally both names for the same battle entered the popular culture, such as the First and Second Battle of Bull Run, which are also referred to as the First and Second Battle of Manassas.', u'Sometimes in desert warfare, there is no nearby town name to use; map coordinates gave the name to the Battle of 73 Easting in the First Gulf War.', u'Some place names have become synonymous with the battles that took place there, such as the Passchendaele, Pearl Harbor, the Alamo, Thermopylae, or Waterloo.', u'Military operations, many of which result in battle, are given codenames, which are not necessarily meaningful or indicative of the type or the location of the battle.', u'Operation Market Garden and Operation Rolling Thunder are examples of battles known by their military codenames.', u'When a battleground is the site of more than one battle in the same conflict, the instances are distinguished by ordinal number, such as the First and Second Battles of Bull Run.', u'An extreme case are the twelve Battles of the Isonzo\u2014First to Twelfth\u2014between Italy and Austria-Hungary during the First World War.', u'Some battles are named for the convenience of military historians so that periods of combat can be neatly distinguished from one another.', u'Following the First World War, the British Battles Nomenclature Committee was formed to decide on standard names for all battles and subsidiary actions.', u'To the soldiers who did the fighting, the distinction was usually academic; a soldier fighting at Beaumont Hamel on November 13, 1916 was probably unaware he was taking part in what the committee would call the "Battle of the Ancre".', u'Many combats are too small to merit a name.', u'Terms such as "action", "skirmish", "firefight", "raid" or "offensive patrol" are used to describe small-scale battle-like encounters.', u'These combats often take place within the time and space of a battle and while they may have an objective, they are not necessarily "decisive".', u'Sometimes the soldiers are unable to immediately gauge the significance of the combat; in the aftermath of the Battle of Waterloo, some British officers were in doubt as to whether the day\'s events merited the title of "battle" or would be passed off as merely an "action".', u'== Effects ==\nBattles affect the individuals who take part, as well as the political actors.', u'Personal effects of battle range from mild psychological issues to permanent and crippling injuries.', u'Some battle-survivors have nightmares about the conditions they encountered, or abnormal reactions to certain sights or sounds.', u'Some suffer flashbacks.', u'Physical effects of battle can include scars, amputations, lesions, loss of bodily functions, blindness, paralysis \u2014 and death.', u'Battles also affect politics.', u'A decisive battle can cause the losing side to surrender, while a Pyrrhic Victory such as the Battle of Asculum can cause the winning side to reconsider its long-term goals.', u'Battles in civil wars have often decided the fate of monarchs or political factions.', u'Famous examples include the War of the Roses, as well as the Jacobite Uprisings.', u'Battles also affect the commitment of one side or the other to the continuance of a war, for example the Battle of Incheon and the Battle of Hue during the Tet Offensive.', u'== See also ==\nList of battles\nMilitary strategy\nMilitary tactics\nNaval battle\nPitched

by the Inner German border.', u'After 1961 West Berlin was physically separated from East Berlin as well as from East Germany by the Berlin Wall.', u'This situation ended when East Germany was dissolved and its five states joined the ten states of the Federal Republic of Germany along with the reunified city-state of Berlin.', u'With the reunification of West and East Germany, the Federal Republic of Germany, enlarged now to sixteen states, became known simply as "Germany".', u'This period is also referred to as the Bonn Republic (Bonner Republik) by historians, alluding to the interwar Weimar Republic and the post-reunification Berlin Republic.', u'The Federal Republic of Germany was established from eleven states formed in the three Allied Zones of occupation held by the United States, the United Kingdom and France (the "Western Zones").', u'Its population grew from roughly 51 million in 1950 to more than 63 million in 1990.', u'The city of Bonn was its de facto capital city (Berlin was symbolically named the de jure capital city in the West German Basic Law).', u'The fourth Allied occupation zone (the East Zone, or Ostzone) was held by the Soviet Union.', u'The parts of this zone lying east of the Oder-Neisse were in fact annexed by the Soviet Union and communist Poland; the remaining central part around Berlin became the communist German Democratic Republic (abbreviated GDR; in German Deutsche Demokratische Republik or DDR) with its de facto capital in East Berlin.', u'As a result, West Germany had a territory about half the size of the interbellum democratic Weimar Republic.', u'At the onset of the Cold War, Germany (and, indeed, Europe) was divided among the Western and Eastern blocs.', u'Germany was de facto divided into two countries and two special territories, the Saarland and divided Berlin.', u'The Federal Republic of Germany claimed an exclusive mandate for all of Germany, considering itself to be the democratically reorganised continuation of the 1871\u20131945 German Reich.', u'It took the line that the GDR was an illegally constituted puppet state.', u'Though the GDR did hold regular elections, these were not free and fair.', u'For all practical purposes the GDR was a Soviet puppet state.', u'From the West German perspective the GDR was therefore illegitimate.', u'Three southwestern states of West Germany merged to form Baden-W\xfcrttemberg in 1952, and the Saarland joined the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957.', u'In addition to the resulting ten states, West Berlin was considered an unofficial de facto 11th state.', u'While legally not part of the Federal Republic of Germany, as Berlin was under the control of the Allied Control Council, West Berlin aligned itself politically with West Germany and was directly or indirectly represented in its federal institutions.', u'Relations with the Soviet bloc improved during the era of "Neue Ostpolitik" around 1970, and West Germany began taking the line of "two German states within one German nation", but formally maintained the exclusive mandate.', u'It recognised the GDR as a de facto government within a single German nation that in turn was represented de jure by the West German state alone.', u'From 1973 onward, East Germany recognised the existence of two German countries de jure, and the West as both de facto and de jure foreign country.', u'The Federal Republic and the GDR agreed that neither of them could speak in the name of the other.', u"The foundation for the influential position held by Germany today was laid during the Wirtschaftswunder (economic miracle) of the 1950s when West Germany rose from the enormous destruction wrought by World War II to become the world's third largest economy.", u'The first chancellor Konrad Adenauer, who remained in office until 1963, had worked for a full alignment with the West rather than neutrality.', u'He not only secured a membership in NATO but was also a proponent of agreements that developed into the present-day European Union.', u'When the G6/G8 was established in 1975, there was no question whether the Federal Republic of Germany would be a member as well.', u'With the collapse of communism in Central and Eastern Europe in 1989, symbolised by the opening of the Berlin Wall, there was a rapid move towards German reunification.', u'East Germany voted to dissolve itself and accede to the Federal Republic in 1990.', u'Its five post-war states (L\xe4nder) were reconstituted along with the reunited Berlin, which ended its special status and formed an additional Land.', u'They formally joined the Federal Republic on 3 October 1990, raising the number of states from 10 to 16, ending the division of Germany.', u"The expanded Federal Republic retained West Germany's political culture and continued its existing memberships in international organisations, as well as its Western foreign policy alignment and affiliation to Western alliances like NATO and the European Union.", u'== Naming conventions ==\n\nThe official name of West Germany, adopted in 1949 and unchanged since, is Bundesrepublik Deutschland (Federal Republic of Germany).', u'Its abbreviation "BRD" (German) or "FRG" (English) was sometimes also used.', u'In East Germany usage, the terms Westdeutschland (West Germany) or westdeutsche Bundesrepublik (West German Federal Republic) were preferred during the 1950s and 1960s.', u'This changed once East Germany considered West Germans and West Berliners foreigners under its 1968 constitution, where the idea of a single German nation was abandoned.', u'In the early 1970s, starting in the East German Neues Deutschland, the initialism "BRD" (FRG) for the "Federal Republic of Germany" began to prevail.', u'In 1973 official East German sources adopted it as a standard expression and other Eastern Bloc nations soon followed suit.', u'In reaction to this move, in 1965 the Federal Minister of All-German Affairs Erich Mende issued the Directives for the appellation of Germany recommending avoiding the initialism.', u'On 31 May 1974 the heads of German federal and state governments recommended to always use the full name in official publications.', u'From then on West German sources avoided the abbreviated form, with the exception of left-leaning organizations which embraced it.', u'In November 1979 the federal government informed the Bundestag that the West German public broadcasters ARD and ZDF had agreed to refuse to use the initialism.', u'The colloquial term "West Germany" or its equivalent was used in many languages.', u'"Westdeutschland" was also a widespread colloquial form used in German-speaking countries, usually without political overtones.', u'== History ==\n\nOn 4\u201311 February 1945 leaders from the United States, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union held the Yalta Conference where future arrangements as regards post-war Europe and strategy against Japan in the Pacific were negotiated.', u'The conference agreed to split Germany into four occupation zones: a French Zone in the far west; a British Zone in the northwest; an American Zone in the south; and a Soviet Zone in the east.', u'At the time, the intention was not to split Germany, only to designate zones of administration.', u'Former German areas east of the rivers Oder and Neisse were put under Polish administration.', u'Millions of Germans were expelled and replaced by Poles.', u'In similar fashion, the Soviet Union took over areas of eastern Poland and East Prussia.', u'Between 1946 and 1949, three of the occupation zones began to merge.', u'First, the British and American zones were combined into the quasi-state of Bizonia.', u'Soon afterwards, the French zone was included into Trizonia.', u'At the same time, new federal states (L\xe4nder) were formed in the Allied zones, replacing the pre-war states.', u'In 1949 with the continuation and aggravation of the Cold War (witness the Berlin Airlift of 1948\u201349), the two German states that were originated in the Western Allied and the Soviet Zones became known internationally as West Germany and East Germany.', u'Commonly known in English as East Germany, the former Soviet Occupation Zone, eventually became the German Democratic Republic or GDR.', u"From 3 October 1990, after the reformation of the GDR's L\xe4nder, the

on 5 May 1955 (although "full sovereignty" was not obtained until the Two Plus Four Agreement in 1990).', u'The former occupying Western troops remained on the ground, now as part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which West Germany joined on 9 May 1955, promising to rearm itself soon.', u'West Germany became a focus of the Cold War with its juxtaposition to East Germany, a member of the subsequently founded Warsaw Pact.', u'The former capital, Berlin, had been divided into four sectors, with the Western Allies joining their sectors to form West Berlin, while the Soviets held East Berlin.', u'West Berlin was completely surrounded by East German territory and had suffered a Soviet blockade in 1948\u201349, which was overcome by the Berlin airlift.', u'The outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 led to U.S. calls to rearm West Germany to help defend Western Europe from the perceived Soviet threat.', u"Germany's partners in the Coal and Steel Community proposed to establish a European Defence Community (EDC), with an integrated army, navy and air force, composed of the armed forces of its member states.", u'The West German military would be subject to complete EDC control, but the other EDC member states (Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) would cooperate in the EDC while maintaining independent control of their own armed forces.', u'Though the EDC treaty was signed (May 1952), it never entered into force.', u"France's Gaullists rejected it on the grounds that it threatened national sovereignty, and when the French National Assembly refused to ratify it (August 1954), the treaty died.", u"The French Gaullists and communists had killed the French government's proposal.", u'Other means then had to be found to allow West German rearmament.', u'In response, at the London and Paris Conferences, the Brussels Treaty was modified to include West Germany, and to form the Western European Union (WEU).', u'West Germany was to be permitted to rearm (an idea many Germans rejected), and have full sovereign control of its military, called the Bundeswehr.', u'The WEU, however, would regulate the size of the armed forces permitted to each of its member states.', u'Also, the German constitution prohibited any military action, except in case of an external attack against Germany or its allies (B\xfcndnisfall).', u'Also, Germans could reject military service on grounds of conscience, and serve for civil purposes instead.', u'The three Western Allies retained occupation powers in Berlin and certain responsibilities for Germany as a whole.', u'Under the new arrangements, the Allies stationed troops within West Germany for NATO defense, pursuant to stationing and status-of-forces agreements.', u"With the exception of 55,000 French troops, Allied forces were under NATO's joint defense command.", u'(France withdrew from the collective military command structure of NATO in 1966.)', u'=== Reforms during the 1960s ===\nKonrad Adenauer was 73 years old when he became chancellor, and for this reason he was initially reckoned as a caretaker.', u'However, he stayed in power for 14 years.', u'The grand old man of German postwar politics had to be dragged\u2014almost literally\u2014out of office in 1963.', u'In 1959 it was time to elect a new President and Adenauer decided that he would nominate Erhard, the architect of the economic miracle.', u"Erhard was not enthusiastic, and to everybody's surprise, Adenauer decided at the age of 83 that he would take on the position.", u'He apparently believed that this would allow him to dominate the scene for up to ten more years in spite of the growing mood for change.', u'However, when his advisers informed him that the powers of the president were almost entirely ceremonial, he quickly lost interest.', u'An alternative candidate was needed and eventually the Minister of Agriculture, Heinrich L\xfcbke took on the task and was duly elected.', u'In October 1962 the weekly news magazine Der Spiegel published an analysis of the West German military defence.', u'The conclusion was that there were several weaknesses in the system.', u'Ten days after publication, the offices of Der Spiegel in Hamburg were raided by the police and quantities of documents were seized.', u'Chancellor Adenauer proclaimed in the Bundestag that the article was tantamount to high treason and that the authors would be prosecuted.', u'The editor/owner of the magazine, Rudolf Augstein spent some time in jail before the public outcry over the breaking of laws on freedom of the press became too loud to be ignored.', u"The FDP members of Adenauer's cabinet resigned from the government, demanding the resignation of Franz Josef Strauss, Defence Minister, who had decidedly overstepped his competence during the crisis.", u'Adenauer was still wounded by his brief run for president, and this episode damaged his reputation even further.', u'He announced that he would step down in the Fall of 1963.', u'His successor was to be Ludwig Erhard.', u'In the early 1960s the rate of economic growth slowed down significantly.', u'In 1962 growth rate was 4.7% and the following year, 2.0%.', u'After a brief recovery, the growth rate slowed again into a recession, with no growth in 1967.', u'A new coalition was formed to deal with this problem.', u'Erhard stepped down in 1966 and was succeeded by Kurt Georg Kiesinger.', u"He led a grand coalition between West Germany's two largest parties, the CDU/CSU and the Social Democratic Party (SPD).", u'This was important for the introduction of new emergency acts: the grand coalition gave the ruling parties the two-thirds majority of votes required for their ratification.', u'These controversial acts allowed basic constitutional rights such as freedom of movement to be limited in case of a state of emergency.', u'During the time leading up to the passing of the laws, there was fierce opposition to them, above all by the Free Democratic Party, the rising German student movement, a group calling itself Notstand der Demokratie ("Democracy in Crisis") and members of the Campaign against Nuclear Armament.', u'A key event in the development of open democratic debate occurred in 1967, when the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, visited West Berlin.', u'Several thousand demonstrators gathered outside the Opera House where he was to attend a special performance.', u'Supporters of the Shah (later known as Jubelperser), armed with staves and bricks attacked the protesters while the police stood by and watched.', u'A demonstration in the centre was being forcibly dispersed when a bystander named Benno Ohnesorg was shot in the head and killed by a plainclothes policeman.', u'(It has now been established that the policeman, Kurras, was a paid spy of the East German security forces.)', u'Protest demonstrations continued, and calls for more active opposition by some groups of students were made, which was declared by the press, especially the tabloid Bild-Zeitung newspaper, as a massive disruption to life in Berlin, in a massive campaign against the protesters.', u'Protests against the US intervention in Vietnam, mingled with anger over the vigour with which demonstrations were repressed led to mounting militance among the students at the universities in Berlin.', u'One of the most prominent campaigners was a young man from East Germany called Rudi Dutschke who also criticised the forms of capitalism that were to be seen in West Berlin.', u'Just before Easter 1968, a young man tried to kill Dutschke as he bicycled to the student union, seriously injuring him.', u'All over West Germany, thousands demonstrated against the Springer newspapers which were seen as the prime cause of the violence against students.', u'Trucks carrying newspapers were set on fire and windows in office buildings broken.', u"In the wakes of these demonstrations, in which the question of America's role in Vietnam began to play a bigger role, came a desire among the students to find out more about the role of the parent-generation in the Nazi era.", u'The proceedings of the War Crimes Tribunal at Nuremberg had been widely publicised in Germany but until a new generation of teachers, educated with the findings of historical studies, could begin to reveal the truth about the war and the crimes committed in the name of the German people.', u'One courageous attorney, Fritz Bauer patiently gathered evidence on the guards of the Auschwitz concentration camp and about twenty were put on trial in Frankfurt in 1963.', u'Daily newspaper reports and visits by school classes to the proceedings revealed to the German public the nature of the concentration camp system and it became evident that the Shoah was of vastly greater dimensions than the German population had believed.', u'(The term "Holocaust" for the systematic mass-murder of Jews first came into use in 1979, when an American mini-series with that name was shown on German television.)', u'The processes set in motion by the Auschwitz trial reverberated decades later.', u'The calling in question of the actions and policies of government led to a new climate of debate.', u'The issues of emancipation, colonialism, environmentalism and grass roots democracy were discussed at all levels of society.', u'In 1979 the environmental party, the Greens, reached the 5% limit required to obtain parliamentary seats in the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen provincial election.', u'Also of great significance was the steady growth of a feminist movement in which women demonstrated for equal rights.', u'Until 1977 a married woman had to have the permission of her husband if she wanted to take on a job or open a bank account.', u'Further reforms in 1979 to parental rights law gave equal legal rights to the mother and the father, abolishing the legal authority of the father.', u'Parallel to this, a gay movement began to grow in the larger cities, especially in West Berlin, where homosexuality had been widely accepted during the twenties in the Weimar Republic.', u'Anger over the treatment of demonstrators following the death of Benno Ohnesorg and the attack on Rudi Dutschke, coupled with growing frustration over the lack of success in achieving their aims led to growing militance among students and their supporters.', u'In May 1968, three young people set fire to two department stores in Frankfurt, they were brought to trial and made very clear to the court that they regarded their action as a legitimate act in what they described as the "struggle against imperialism".', u'The student movement began to split into different factions, ranging from the unattached liberals to the Maoists and supporters of direct action in every form\u2014the anarchists.', u'Several groups set as their objective the aim of radicalising the industrial workers and taking an example from activities in Italy of the Red Brigades (Brigade Rosse), many students went to work in the factories, but with little or no success.', u'The most notorious of the underground groups was the "Baader-Meinhof Group", later known as the Red Army Faction which began by making bank raids to finance their activities and eventually went underground having killed a number of policemen, several bystanders and eventually two prominent West Germans, whom they had taken captive in order to force the release of prisoners sympathetic to their ideas.', u'In the 1990s attacks were still being committed under the name "RAF".', u'The last action took place in 1993 and the group announced it was giving up its activities in 1998.', u'Evidence that the groups had been infiltrated by German Intelligence undercover agents has since emerged, partly through the insistence of the son of one of their prominent victims, the State Counsel Buback.', u'=== Political developments 1969\u201390 ===\nIn the 1969 election, the SPD\u2014headed by Willy Brandt\u2014gained enough votes to form a coalition government with the FDP.', u'Although Chancellor for only just over four years, Willy Brandt was one of the most popular politicians in the whole period.', u'Brandt was a gifted speaker and the growth of the Social Democrats from there on was in no small part due to his personality.', u"Brandt began a policy of rapprochement with West Germany's eastern neighbours, a policy opposed by the CDU.", u'The issue of improving relations with Poland, Czechoslovakia and East Germany made for an increasingly aggressive tone in public debates but it was a huge step forward when Willy Brandt and the Foreign Minister, Walther Scheel (FDP) negotiated agreements with all three countries.', u'(Moscow Agreement, August 1970, Warsaw Agreement, December 1970, Four Power Agreement over the status of West Berlin in 1971 and an agreement on relations between West and East Germany, signed in December 1972.)', u"These agreements were the basis for a rapid improvement in the relations between east and west and led, in the long-term to the dismantlement of the Warsaw Treaty and the Soviet Union's control over Eastern Europe.", u'Chancellor Brandt was forced to resign in May 1974, after G\xfcnter Guillaume, a senior member of his staff, was uncovered as a spy for the East German intelligence service, the Stasi.', u"Brandt's contributions to world peace led to his nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971.", u'Finance Minister Helmut Schmidt (SPD) formed a coalition and he served as Chancellor from 1974 to 1982.', u'Hans-Dietrich Genscher, a leading FDP official, became Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister.', u'Schmidt, a strong supporter of the European Community (EC) and the Atlantic alliance, emphasized his commitment to "the political unification of Europe in partnership with the USA".', u'In October 1982 the SPD\u2013FDP coalition fell apart when the FDP joined forces with the CDU/CSU to elect CDU Chairman Helmut Kohl as Chancellor in a constructive vote of no confidence.', u'Following national elections in March 1983, Kohl emerged in firm control of both the government and the CDU.', u'The CDU/CSU fell just short of an absolute majority, due to the entry into the Bundestag of the Greens, who received 5.6% of the vote.', u'In January 1987 the Kohl\u2013Genscher government was returned to office, but the FDP and the Greens gained at the expense of the larger parties.', u"Kohl's CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, slipped from 48.8% of the vote in 1983 to 44.3%.", u'The SPD fell to 37%; long-time SPD Chairman Brandt subsequently resigned in April 1987 and was succeeded by Hans-Jochen Vogel.', u"The FDP's share rose from 7% to 9.1%, its best showing since 1980.", u"The Greens' share rose to 8.3% from their 1983 share of 5.6%.", u'=== Reunification ===\n\nThe official German reunification ceremony on 3 October 1990 was held at the Reichstag building, including Chancellor Helmut Kohl, President Richard von Weizs\xe4cker, former Chancellor Willy Brandt and many others.', u'One day later, the parliament of the united Germany would assemble in an act of symbolism in the Reichstag building.', u'Germany had split into two places in 1945, after the end of World War Two.', u'However, at that time, the role of Berlin had not yet been decided upon.', u'Only after a fierce debate, considered by many as one of the most memorable sessions of parliament, the Bundestag concluded on 20 June 1991, with quite a slim majority, that both government and parliament should move to Berlin from Bonn.', u'== West German "economic miracle" ==\nThe West German Wirtschaftswunder ("economic miracle", coined by The Times in 1950) was partly due to the economic aid provided by the United States and the Marshall Plan, but mainly due to the currency reform of 1948 which replaced the Reichsmark with the Deutsche Mark and halted rampant inflation.', u'The Allied dismantling of the West German coal and steel industry finally ended in 1950.', u'In addition to the physical obstacles that had to be overcome for the German economic recovery (see the Morgenthau Plan) there were also intellectual challenges.', u'The Allies confiscated intellectual privileges of huge value, such as all German patents, both in Germany and abroad, and used them to strengthen their own industrial competitiveness by licensing them to Allied companies.', u'Meanwhile, some of the best German researchers were being put to work in the Soviet Union and in the USA.', u'Contrary to popular belief, the Marshall Plan, which was extended to include the newly formed West Germany in 1949, was not the main force behind the Wirtschaftswunder.', u'Had that been the case, other countries such as the United Kingdom and France (which both received higher economic assistance from the plan than Germany) should have experienced the same phenomenon.', u'In fact, the amount of monetary aid (which was in the form of loans) received by Germany through the Marshall Plan was far overshadowed by the amount the Germans had to pay back as war reparations and by the charges the Allies exacted from the Germans for the ongoing cost of occupation (about $2.4 billion per year).', u'In 1953 it was decided that Germany was to repay $1.1 billion of the aid it had received.', u'The last repayment was made in June 1971.', u'As demand for consumer goods increased after WWII, the resulting shortage helped overcome lingering resistance to the purchase of German products.', u'At the time Germany had a large pool of skilled and cheap labour, partly as a result of the flight and expulsion of Germans from Central and Eastern Europe, which affected up to 16.5 million Germans.', u'This helped Germany to more than double the value of its exports during the war.', u'Apart from these factors, hard work and long hours at full capacity among the population and in the late 1950s and 1960s extra labour supplied by thousands of Gastarbeiter ("guest workers") provided a vital base for the economic upturn.', u'This would have implications later on for successive German governments as they tried to assimilate this group of workers.', u'From the late 1950s onwards, West Germany had one of the strongest economies in the world, almost as strong as before the Second World War.', u'The East German economy showed a certain growth, but not as much as in West Germany, partly because of continued reparations to the USSR in terms of resources.', u'In 1952 West Germany became part of the European Coal and Steel Community, which would later evolve into the European Union.', u'On 5 May 1955 West Germany was declared to have the "authority of a sovereign state".', u'The British, French and U.S. militaries remained in the country, just as the Soviet Army remained in East Germany.', u'Four days after obtaining the "authority of a sovereign state" in 1955, West Germany joined NATO.', u'The UK and the USA retained an especially strong presence in West Germany, acting as a deterrent in case of a Soviet invasion.', u'In 1976 West Germany became one of the founding nations of the Group of Six (G6).', u"In 1973, West Germany\u2014home to roughly 1.26% of the world's population\u2014featured the world's fourth largest GDP of 944 billion (5.9% of the world total).", u'In 1987 the FRG held a 7.4% share of total world production.', u'== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nTotal population of West Germany from 1950 to 1990, as collected by the Statistisches Bundesamt.', u'=== Religion ===\n\nReligious affiliation in West Germany as collected by fowid (Forschungsgruppe Weltanschauungen in Deutschland).', u'Protestantism in Germany (EKD)\nRoman Catholicism in Germany\nIslam in Germany\nCentral Council of Jews in Germany\n\n\n== Position towards East Germany ==\n\nThe official position of West Germany concerning East Germany at the outset was that the West German government was the only democratically elected, and therefore the only legitimate, representative of the German people.', u'According to the Hallstein Doctrine, any country (with the exception of the USSR) that recognised the authorities of the German Democratic Republic would not have diplomatic relations with West Germany.', u'In the early 1970s, Willy Brandt\'s policy of "Neue Ostpolitik" led to a form of mutual recognition between East and West Germany.', u'The Treaty of Moscow (August 1970), the Treaty of Warsaw (December 1970), the Four Power Agreement on Berlin (September 1971), the Transit Agreement (May 1972), and the Basic Treaty (December 1972) helped to normalise relations between East and West Germany and led to both German states joining the United Nations.', u'The Hallstein Doctrine was relinquished, and West Germany ceased to claim an exclusive mandate for Germany as a whole.', u'The West German Constitution (Grundgesetz, "Basic Law") provided two articles for the unification with other parts of Germany:\nArticle 23 provided the possibility for other parts of Germany to join the Federal Republic (under the constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany).', u'Article 146 provided the possibility for unification of all parts of Germany under a new constitution.', u'After the peaceful revolution of 1989 in East Germany, the first freely elected East German parliament decided in June 1990 that the L\xe4nder soon to be re-established would join the Federal Republic under Article 23 of the (West) German Basic Law (Grundgesetz).', u'This made a quick unification possible.', u'In July/August 1990 the East German parliament enacted a law for the re-establishment of L\xe4nder on the territory of the German Democratic Republic.', u'The two German states entered into a currency and customs union in July 1990, and on 3 October 1990, the German Democratic Republic dissolved and the re-established five East German L\xe4nder (as well as a unified Berlin) joined the Federal Republic of Germany, bringing an end to the East-West divide.', u'== Politics ==\nPolitical life in West Germany was remarkably stable and orderly.', u'The Adenauer era (1949\u201363) was followed by a brief period under Ludwig Erhard (1963\u201366) who, in turn, was replaced by Kurt Georg Kiesinger (1966\u201369).', u'All governments between 1949 and 1966 were formed by the united caucus of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU), either alone or in coalition with the smaller Free Democratic Party (FDP) or other right-wing parties.', u'Kiesinger\'s 1966\u201369 "Grand Coalition" was between West Germany\'s two largest parties, the CDU/CSU and the Social Democratic Party (SPD).', u'This was important for the introduction of new emergency acts\u2014the Grand Coalition gave the ruling parties the two-thirds majority of votes required to see them in.', u'These controversial acts allowed basic constitutional rights such as freedom of movement to be limited in case of a state of emergency.', u'Leading up to the passing of the laws, there was fierce opposition to them, above all by the FDP, the rising German student movement, a group calling itself Notstand der Demokratie ("Democracy in a State of Emergency") and the labour unions.', u'Demonstrations and protests grew in number, and in 1967 the student Benno Ohnesorg was shot in the head by a policeman.', u'The press, especially the tabloid Bild-Zeitung newspaper, launched a campaign against the protesters.', u'By 1958 a stronger desire to confront the Nazi past had come into being.', u'In the 1960s environmentalism and anti-nationalism became fundamental values among left-wing Germans.', u'As a result, in 1979 the Greens were able to reach the 5% minimum required to obtain parliamentary seats in the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen state election, and with the foundation of the national party in 1980 developed into one of the most politically successful green movements in the world.', u'Another result of the unrest in the 1960s was the founding of the Red Army Faction (RAF).', u'The RAF was active from 1968, carrying out a succession of terrorist attacks in West Germany during the 1970s.', u'Even in the 1990s, attacks were still being committed under the name RAF.', u'The last action took place in 1993, and in 1998 the group announced it was ceasing activities.', u'In the 1969 election, the SPD gained enough votes to form a coalition government with the FDP.', u'SPD leader and Chancellor Willy Brandt remained head of government until May 1974, when he resigned after the Guillaume Affair, in which a senior member of his staff was uncovered as a spy for the East German intelligence service, the Stasi.', u"However the affair is widely considered to have been merely a trigger for Brandt's resignation, not a fundamental cause.", u'Instead, Brandt, dogged by scandal relating to alcohol and depression as well as the economic fallout of the 1973 oil crisis, almost seems simply to have had enough.', u'As Brandt himself later said, "I was exhausted, for reasons which had nothing to do with the process going on at the time".', u'Finance Minister Helmut Schmidt (SPD) then formed a government, continuing the SPD\u2013FDP coalition.', u'He served as Chancellor from 1974 to 1982.', u'Hans-Dietrich Genscher, a leading FDP official, was Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister in the same years.', u'Schmidt, a strong supporter of the European Community (EC) and the Atlantic alliance, emphasized his commitment to "the political unification of Europe in partnership with the USA".', u'The goals of SPD and FDP however drifted apart in the late 1970s and early 1980s.', u'On 1 October 1982 the FDP joined forces with the CDU/CSU to elect CDU Chairman Helmut Kohl as Chancellor in a constructive vote of no confidence.', u'Following national elections in March 1983, Kohl emerged in firm control of both the government and the CDU.', u'The CDU/CSU fell just short of an absolute majority, because of the entry into the Bundestag of the Greens, who received 5.6% of the vote.', u'In January 1987 the Kohl\u2013Genscher government was returned to office, but the FDP and the Greens gained at the expense of the larger parties.', u'The Social Democrats concluded that not only were the Greens unlikely to form a coalition, but also that such a coalition would be far from a majority.', u'Neither condition changed until 1998.', u'== Culture ==\nIn many aspects, German culture continued in spite of the dictatorship and wartime.', u'Old and new forms coexisted next to each other, and the American influence, already strong in the 1920s, grew.', u'=== Sport ===\n\nIn the 20th century association football became the largest sport in Germany.', u'The Germany national football team, established in 1900, continued its tradition based in the Federal Republic of Germany, winning the 1954 FIFA World Cup in a stunning upset dubbed the miracle of Bern.', u'Earlier, the German team was not considered part of the international top.', u'The 1974 FIFA World Cup was held in West German cities and West Berlin.', u'After having been beaten by their East German counterparts in the first round, the team of the German Football Association won the cup again, defeating the Netherlands 2\u20131 in the final.', u'With the process of unification in full swing in the summer of 1990, the Germans won a third World Cup, with players that had been capped for East Germany not yet permitted to contribute.', u'European championships have been won too, in 1972, 1980 and 1996.', u'After both Olympic Games of 1936 had been held in Germany, Munich was selected to host the 1972 Summer Olympics.', u'These were also the first summer games in which the East Germans showed up with the separate flag and anthem of the GDR.', u'Since the 1950s, Germany at the Olympics had been represented by a united team led by the pre-war German NOC officials as the IOC had denied East German demands for a separate team.', u'As in 1957, when the Saarland acceded, East German sport organisations ceased to exist in late 1990 as their subdivisions and their members joined their Western counterparts.', u'Thus, the present German organisations and teams in football, Olympics and elsewhere are identical to those that had been informally called "West German" before 1991.', u'The only differences were a larger membership and a different name used by some foreigners.', u'These organisations and teams in turn mostly continued the traditions of those that represented Germany before the Second World War, and even the First World War, thus providing a century-old continuity despite political changes.', u'On the other hand, the separate East German teams and organisations were founded in the 1950s; they were an episode lasting less than four decades, yet quite successful in that time.', u'As of 2012, West Germany have played a record 43 matches at the European Championships.', u'=== Literary scene ===\nBesides the interest in the older generation of writers, new authors emerged on the background of the experiences of war and after war period.', u'Wolfgang Borchert, a former soldier who died young in 1947, is one of the best known representatives of the Tr\xfcmmerliteratur.', u'Heinrich B\xf6ll is considered an observer of the young Federal Republic from the 1950s to the 1970s, and caused some political controversies because of his increasingly critical view on society.', u'The Frankfurt Book Fair (and its Peace Prize of the German Book Trade) soon developed into a regarded institution.', u"Exemplary for West Germany's literature are \u2013 among others \u2013 Siegfried Lenz (with The German Lesson) and G\xfcnter Grass (with The Tin Drum and The Flounder).", u'=== Daily life ===\nDuring the 40 years of separation some divergence occurred in the cultural life of the two parts of the severed nation.', u'Both West Germany and East Germany followed along traditional paths of the common German culture, but West Germany, being obviously more affected by influences from western Europe and North America, became more cosmopolitan.', u'Conversely, East Germany, while remaining more conservative than West Germany in its adherence to some aspects of the received tradition, was strongly moulded by the dictates of a state socialist ideology of predominantly Soviet inspiration.', u"On the non-political level, East Germany was also influenced by the Eastern Bloc's Slavic cultures that manifested in art, culinary scene, and sports.", u'Nevertheless, young East Germans were also fascinated by Western and particularly American culture, which they had a degree of access to in a variety of ways, not least through West German television and radio, whose broadcasts reached many parts of the country.', u'For the majority of Germans in present-day Germany who lived in pre-reunification West Germany, there has been minimal change in daily life stemming from German reunification as the reunified country is essentially West Germany incorporating East Germany on a West German base.', u'In contrast, for East Germans the scale of change has been sweeping in all aspects of life from that before die Wende.', u'Although movements like Ostalgie exist attempting to celebrate and preserve parts of the GDR culture, since reunification the former East Germany has been converging towards the western part of the country in most parts of daily life.', u'== Geographical distribution of government ==\nIn West Germany, most of the political agencies and buildings were located in Bonn, while the German Stock Market was located in Frankfurt am Main, which became the economic center.', u'The judicial branch of both the German Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) and the highest Court of Appeals, were located in Karlsruhe.', u'The West German government was known to be much more decentralised than its state socialist East German counterpart, the former being a federal state and the latter a unitary one.', u'Whilst East Germany was divided into 15 administrative districts (Bezirke), which were merely local branches of the national government, West Germany was divided into states (L\xe4nder) with independently elected state parliaments and control of the Bundesrat, the second legislative chamber of the Federal Government.', u'== Present geographical and political terminology ==\nToday, North Rhine-Westphalia is often considered to be Western Germany in geographical terms.', u'When distinguishing between former West Germany and former East Germany as parts of present-day unified Germany, it has become most common to refer to the Alte Bundesl\xe4nder (old states) and the Neue Bundesl\xe4nder (new states), although Westdeutschland and Ostdeutschland are still heard as well.', u'== See also ==\n\nBonn\u2013Paris conventions\nPetersberg Agreement\nWest Berlin\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBark, Dennis L., and David R.

{'sentences': [u'A watch is a small timepiece intended to be carried or worn by a person.', u"It is designed to keep working despite the motions caused by the person's activities.", u'A wristwatch is designed to be worn on a wrist, attached by a watch strap or other type of bracelet.', u'A pocket watch is designed for a person to carry in a pocket.', u'Watches evolved in the 17th century from spring-powered clocks, which appeared as early as the 14th century.', u'During most of its history the watch was a mechanical device, driven by clockwork, powered by winding a mainspring, and keeping time with an oscillating balance wheel.', u'In the 1960s the electronic quartz watch was invented, which was powered by a battery and kept time with a vibrating quartz crystal.', u'By the 1980s the quartz watch had taken over most of the market from the mechanical watch.', u'Today most inexpensive and medium-priced watches, used mainly for timekeeping, have quartz movements.', u'Expensive collectible watches, valued more for their elaborate craftsmanship, aesthetic appeal and glamorous design than for simple timekeeping, often have traditional mechanical movements, even though they are less accurate and more expensive than electronic ones.', u'Various extra features, called "complications", such as moon-phase displays and the different types of tourbillon, are sometimes included.', u'Modern watches often display the day, date, month and year, and electronic watches may have many other functions.', u'Time-related features such as timers, chronographs and alarm functions are common.', u'Some modern designs incorporate calculators, GPS and Bluetooth technology or have heart-rate monitoring capabilities.', u'Some watches use radio clock technology to regularly correct the time.', u'Developments in the 2010s include smartwatches, which are elaborate computer-like electronic devices designed to be worn on a wrist.', u'They generally incorporate timekeeping functions, but these are only small fractions of what the smartwatch can do.', u'The study of timekeeping is known as horology.', u'== History ==\n\nWatches evolved from portable spring-driven clocks, which first appeared in 15th century Europe.', u"Watches weren't widely worn in pockets until the 17th century.", u'One account says that the word "watch" came from the Old English word woecce which meant "watchman", because it was used by town watchmen to keep track of their shifts at work.', u'Another says that the term came from 17th century sailors, who used the new mechanisms to time the length of their shipboard watches (duty shifts).', u'A great leap forward in accuracy occurred in 1657 with the addition of the balance spring to the balance wheel, an invention disputed both at the time and ever since between Robert Hooke and Christiaan Huygens.', u"This innovation increased watches' accuracy enormously, reducing error from perhaps several hours per day to perhaps 10 minutes per day, resulting in the addition of the minute hand to the face from around 1680 in Britain and 1700 in France.", u'The increased accuracy of the balance wheel focused attention on errors caused by other parts of the movement, igniting a two century wave of watchmaking innovation.', u'The first thing to be improved was the escapement.', u'The verge escapement was replaced in quality watches by the cylinder escapement, invented by Thomas Tompion in 1695 and further developed by George Graham in the 1720s.', u'Improvements in manufacturing such as the tooth-cutting machine devised by Robert Hooke allowed some increase in the volume of watch production, although finishing and assembling was still done by hand until well into the 19th century.', u'A major cause of error in balance wheel timepieces, caused by changes in elasticity of the balance spring from temperature changes, was solved by the bimetallic temperature compensated balance wheel invented in 1765 by Pierre Le Roy and improved by Thomas Earnshaw.', u'The lever escapement was the single most important technological breakthrough, and was invented by Thomas Mudge in 1759 and improved by Josiah Emery in 1785, although it only gradually came into use from about 1800 onwards, chiefly in Britain.', u'The British had predominated in watch manufacture for much of the 17th and 18th centuries, but maintained a system of production that was geared towards high quality products for the elite.', u'Although there was an attempt to modernise clock manufacture with mass production techniques and the application of duplicating tools and machinery by the British Watch Company in 1843, it was in the United States that this system took off.', u'Aaron Lufkin Dennison started a factory in 1851 in Massachusetts that used interchangeable parts, and by 1861 it was running a successful enterprise incorporated as the Waltham Watch Company.', u'=== Wristwatch ===\n\nThe concept of the wristwatch goes back to the production of the very earliest watches in the 16th century.', u'Elizabeth I of England received a wristwatch from Robert Dudley in 1571, described as an arm watch.', u'The oldest surviving Wristwatch (then described as a bracelet watch) is one made in 1806 and given to Jos\xe9phine de Beauharnais.', u'From the beginning, wrist watches were almost exclusively worn by women, while men used pocket-watches up until the early 20th century.', u'Wristwatches were first worn by military men towards the end of the 19th century, when the importance of synchronizing manoeuvres during war, without potentially revealing the plan to the enemy through signalling, was increasingly recognized.', u"The Garstin Company of London patented a 'Watch Wristlet' design in 1893, but they were probably producing similar designs from the 1880s.", u'Officers in the British Army began using wristwatches during colonial military campaigns in the 1880s, such as during the Anglo-Burma War of 1885.', u'During the First Boer War, the importance of coordinating troop movements and synchronizing attacks against the highly mobile Boer insurgents became paramount, and the use of wristwatches subsequently became widespread among the officer class.', u"The company Mappin & Webb began production of their successful 'campaign watch' for soldiers during the campaign at the Sudan in 1898 and accelerated production for the Second Boer War a few years later.", u'In continental Europe Girard-Perregaux and other Swiss watch makers began supplying German naval officers with wrist watches in about 1880.', u'These early models were essentially standard pocket-watches fitted to a leather strap but, by the early 20th century, manufacturers began producing purpose-built wristwatches.', u'The Swiss company, Dimier Fr\xe8res & Cie patented a wristwatch design with the now standard wire lugs in 1903.', u'Hans Wilsdorf moved to London in 1905 and set up his own business with his brother-in-law Alfred Davis, Wilsdorf & Davis, providing quality timepieces at affordable prices; the company later became Rolex.', u'Wilsdorf was an early convert to the wristwatch, and contracted the Swiss firm Aegler to produce a line of wristwatches.', u"The impact of the First World War dramatically shifted public perceptions on the propriety of the man's wristwatch, and opened up a mass market in the postwar era.", u'The creeping barrage artillery tactic, developed during the war, required precise synchronization between the artillery gunners and the infantry advancing behind the barrage.', u'Service watches produced during the War were specially designed for the rigours of trench warfare, with luminous dials and unbreakable glass.', u'The British War Department began issuing wristwatches to combatants from 1917.', u'By the end of the war, almost all enlisted men wore a wristwatch, and after they were demobilized, the fashion soon caught on: the British Horological Journal wrote in 1917 that "the wristlet watch was little used by the sterner sex before the war, but now is seen on the wrist of nearly every man in uniform and of many men in civilian attire."', u'By 1930, the ratio of wrist- to pocket watches was 50 to 1.', u'The first successful self-winding system was invented by John Harwood in 1923.', u'The introduction of the quartz watch was a revolutionary improvement in watch technology.', u'In place of a balance wheel which oscillated at perhaps 5 or 6 beats per second, it used a quartz crystal resonator which vibrated at 8,192 Hz, driven by a battery-powered oscillator circuit.', u'Since the 1980s, more quartz watches than mechanical ones have been marketed.', u'== Movement ==\n\nA movement of a watch is the mechanism that measures the passage of time and displays the current time (and possibly other information including date, month and day).', u'Movements may be entirely mechanical, entirely electronic (potentially with no moving parts), or they might be a blend of both.', u'Most watches intended mainly for timekeeping today have electronic movements, with mechanical hands on the watch face indicating the time.', u'=== Mechanical ===\n\nCompared to electronic movements, mechanical watches are less accurate, often with errors of seconds per day, and they are sensitive to position, temperature and magnetism.', u'They are also costly to produce, require regular maintenance and adjustments, and are more prone to failures.', u'Nevertheless, the craftsmanship of mechanical watches still attracts interest from part of the watch-buying public, especially among the watch collectors.', u'Skeleton watches are designed to leave the mechanism visible for aesthetic purposes.', u'A mechanical movement uses an escapement mechanism to control and limit the unwinding and winding parts of a spring, converting what would otherwise be a simple unwinding into a controlled and periodic energy release.', u'A mechanical movement also uses a balance wheel together with the balance spring (also known as a hairspring) to control motion of the gear system of the watch in a manner analogous to the pendulum of a pendulum clock.', u'The tourbillon, an optional part for mechanical movements, is a rotating frame for the escapement, which is used to cancel out or reduce the effects of gravitational bias to the timekeeping.', u'Due to the complexity of designing a tourbillon, they are very expensive, and only found in prestigious watches.', u'The pin-lever escapement (called the Roskopf movement after its inventor, Georges Frederic Roskopf), which is a cheaper version of the fully levered movement, was manufactured in huge quantities by many Swiss manufacturers as well as by Timex, until it was replaced by quartz movements.', u'Tuning-fork watches use a type of electromechanical movement.', u'Introduced by Bulova in 1960, they use a tuning fork with a precise frequency (most often 360 hertz) to drive a mechanical watch.', u'The task of converting electronically pulsed fork vibration into rotary movements is done via two tiny jeweled fingers, called pawls.', u'Tuning-fork watches were rendered obsolete when electronic quartz watches were developed.', u'Quartz watches were cheaper to produce besides being more accurate.', u'Traditional mechanical watch movements use a spiral spring called a mainspring as a power source.', u'In manual watches the spring must be rewound periodically by the user by turning the watch crown.', u'Antique pocketwatches were wound by inserting a separate key into a hole in the back of the watch and turning it.', u'Most modern watches are designed to run 40 hours on a winding and thus must be wound daily, but some run for several days and a few have 192-hour mainsprings and are wound weekly.', u"==== Automatic watches ====\n\nA self-winding or automatic watch is one that rewinds the mainspring of a mechanical movement by the natural motions of the wearer's body.", u'The first self-winding mechanism was invented for pocket watches in 1770 by Abraham-Louis Perrelet, but the first "self-winding", or "automatic", wristwatch was the invention of a British watch repairer named John Harwood in 1923.', u'This type of watch winds itself without requiring any special action by the wearer.', u"It uses an eccentric weight, called a winding rotor, which rotates with the movement of the wearer's wrist.", u'The back-and-forth motion of the winding rotor couples to a ratchet to wind the mainspring automatically.', u"Self-winding watches usually can also be wound manually to keep them running when not worn or if the wearer's wrist motions are inadequate to keep the watch wound.", u'In April 2014 the Swatch Group launched the sistem51 wristwatch.', u'It has a purely mechanical movement consisting of only 51 parts, including a novel self-winding mechanism with a transparent oscillating weight.', u'So far, it is the only mechanical movement manufactured entirely on a fully automated assembly line.', u'The low parts count and the automated assembly make it an inexpensive mechanical Swiss watch, which can be considered a successor to Roskopf movements, although of higher quality.', u'=== Electronic ===\n\nElectronic movements, also known as quartz movements, have few or no moving parts, except a quartz crystal which is made to vibrate by the piezoelectric effect.', u'A varying electric voltage is applied to the crystal, which responds by changing its shape so, in combination with some electronic components, it functions as an oscillator.', u'It resonates at a specific highly stable frequency, which is used to accurately pace a timekeeping mechanism.', u'Most quartz movements are primarily electronic but are geared to drive mechanical hands on the face of the watch to provide a traditional analog display of the time, a feature most consumers still prefer.', u"In 1959 Seiko placed an order with Epson (a daughter company of Seiko and the 'brain' behind the quartz revolution) to start developing a quartz wristwatch.", u'The project was codenamed 59A.', u'By the 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympics, Seiko had a working prototype of a portable quartz watch which was used as the time measurements throughout the event.', u'The first prototypes of an electronic quartz wristwatch (not just portable quartz watches as the Seiko timekeeping devices at the Tokyo Olympics in 1964) were made by the CEH research laboratory in Neuch\xe2tel, Switzerland.', u'From 1965 through 1967 pioneering development work was done on a miniaturized 8192 Hz quartz oscillator, a thermo-compensation module and an inhouse-made, dedicated integrated circuit (unlike the hybrid circuits used in the later Seiko Astron wristwatch).', u'As a result, the BETA 1 prototype set new timekeeping performance records at the International Chronometric Competition held at the Observatory of Neuch\xe2tel in 1967.', u'In 1970, 18 manufacturers exhibited production versions of the beta 21 wristwatch, including the Omega Electroquartz as well as Patek Philippe, Rolex Oysterquartz and Piaget.', u"The first quartz watch to enter production was the Seiko 35 SQ Astron, which hit the shelves on 25 December 1969, swiftly followed by the Swiss Beta 21, and then a year later the prototype of one of the world's most accurate wristwatches to date: the Omega Marine Chronometer.", u'Since the technology having been developed by contributions from Japanese, American and Swiss, nobody could patent the whole movement of the quartz wristwatch, thus allowing other manufacturers to participate in the rapid growth and development of the quartz watch market.', u'This ended \u2014 in less than a decade \u2014 almost 100 years of dominance by the mechanical wristwatch legacy.', u'Modern quartz movements are produced in very large quantities, and even the cheapest wristwatches typically have quartz movements.', u"Whereas mechanical movements can typically be off by several seconds a day, an inexpensive quartz movement in a child's wristwatch may still be accurate to within half a second per day \u2014 ten times more accurate than a mechanical movement.", u'After a consolidation of the mechanical watch industry in Switzerland during the 1970s, mass production of quartz wristwatches took off under the leadership of the Swatch Group of companies, a Swiss conglomerate with vertical control of the production of Swiss watches and related products.', u'For quartz wristwatches, subsidiaries of Swatch manufacture watch batteries (Renata), oscillators (Oscilloquartz, now Micro Crystal AG) and integrated circuits (Ebauches Electronic SA, renamed EM Microelectronic-Marin).', u'The launch of the new SWATCH brand in 1983 was marked by bold new styling, design and marketing.', u"Today, the Swatch Group maintains its position as the world's largest watch company.", u"Seiko's efforts to combine the quartz and mechanical movements bore fruit after 20 years of research, leading to the introduction of the Seiko Spring Drive, first in a limited domestic market production in 1999 and to the world in September 2005.", u'The Spring Drive keeps time within quartz standards without the use of a battery, using a traditional mechanical gear train powered by a spring, without the need for a balance wheel either.', u'In 2010, Miyota (Citizen Watch) of Japan introduced a newly developed movement that uses 3 prongs quartz crystal that exclusively produce for Bulova to be used in the Precisionist or Accutron II line, a new type of quartz watch with ultra-high frequency (262.144 kHz) which is claimed to be accurate to +/- 10 seconds a year and has a smooth sweeping second hand rather than one that jumps each second.', u'Radio time signal watches are a type of electronic quartz watch which synchronizes (time transfers) its time with an external time source such as in atomic clocks, time signals from GPS navigation satellites, the German DCF77 signal in Europe, WWVB in the US, and others.', u'Movements of this type may \u2014 among others \u2014 synchronize the time of day and the date, the leap-year status, and the state of daylight saving time (on or off).', u'However, other than the radio receiver, these watches are normal quartz watches in all other aspects.', u'Electronic watches require electricity as a power source, and some mechanical movements and hybrid electronic-mechanical movements also require electricity.', u'Usually the electricity is provided by a replaceable battery.', u'The first use of electrical power in watches was as a substitute for the mainspring, to remove the need for winding.', u'The first electrically powered watch, the Hamilton Electric 500, was released in 1957 by the Hamilton Watch Company of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.', u'Watch batteries (strictly speaking cells, as a battery is composed of multiple cells) are specially designed for their purpose.', u'They are very small and provide tiny amounts of power continuously for very long periods (several years or more).', u'In most cases, replacing the battery requires a trip to a watch-repair shop or watch dealer; this is especially true for watches that are water-resistant, as special tools and procedures are required for the watch to remain water-resistant after battery replacement.', u'Silver-oxide and lithium batteries are popular today; mercury batteries, formerly quite common, are no longer used, for environmental reasons.', u'Cheap batteries may be alkaline, of the same size as silver-oxide cells but providing shorter life.', u'Rechargeable batteries are used in some solar-powered watches.', u'Some electronic watches are powered by the movement of the wearer.', u"For instance, Seiko's kinetic-powered quartz watches use the motion of the wearer's arm: turning a rotating weight which causes a tiny generator to supply power to charge a rechargeable battery that runs the watch.", u'The concept is similar to that of self-winding spring movements, except that electrical power is generated instead of mechanical spring tension.', u'Solar powered watches are powered by light.', u'A photovoltaic cell on the face (dial) of the watch converts light to electricity, which is used to charge a rechargeable battery or capacitor.', u'The movement of the watch draws its power from the rechargeable battery or capacitor.', u'As long as the watch is regularly exposed to fairly strong light (such as sunlight), it never needs battery replacement.', u'Some models need only a few minutes of sunlight to provide weeks of energy (as in the Citizen Eco-Drive).', u'Some of the early solar watches of the 1970s had innovative and unique designs to accommodate the array of solar cells needed to power them (Synchronar, Nepro, Sicura and some models by Cristalonic, Alba, Seiko and Citizen).', u'As the decades progressed and the efficiency of the solar cells increased while the power requirements of the movement and display decreased, solar watches began to be designed to look like other conventional watches.', u"A rarely used power source is the temperature difference between the wearer's arm and the surrounding environment (as applied in the Citizen Eco-Drive Thermo).", u'== Display ==\n\n\n=== Analog ===\n\nTraditionally, watches have displayed the time in analog form, with a numbered dial upon which are mounted at least a rotating hour hand and a longer, rotating minute hand.', u'Many watches also incorporate a third hand that shows the current second of the current minute.', u'Watches powered by quartz usually have a second hand that snaps every second to the next marker.', u'Watches powered by a mechanical movement appears to have a gliding second hand, although it is actually not gliding; the hand merely moves in smaller steps, typically 1/5 of a second, corresponding to the beat (half period) of the balance wheel.', u'In some escapements (for example the duplex escapement), the hand advances every two beats (full period) of the balance wheel, typically 1/2 second in those watches, or even every four beats (two periods, 1 second), in the double duplex escapement.', u'A truly gliding second hand is achieved with the tri-synchro regulator of Spring Drive watches.', u'All of the hands are normally mechanical, physically rotating on the dial, although a few watches have been produced with "hands" that are simulated by a liquid-crystal display.', u'Analog display of the time is nearly universal in watches sold as jewelry or collectibles, and in these watches, the range of different styles of hands, numbers, and other aspects of the analog dial is very broad.', u'In watches sold for timekeeping, analog display remains very popular, as many people find it easier to read than digital display; but in timekeeping watches the emphasis is on clarity and accurate reading of the time under all conditions (clearly marked digits, easily visible hands, large watch faces, etc.).', u'They are specifically designed for the left wrist with the stem (the knob used for changing the time) on the right side of the watch; this makes it easy to change the time without removing the watch from the wrist.', u'This is the case if one is right-handed and the watch is worn on the left wrist (as is traditionally done).', u'If one is left-handed and wears the watch on the right wrist, one has to remove the watch from the wrist to reset the time or to wind the watch.', u'Analog watches as well as clocks are often marketed showing a display time of approximately 1:50 or 10:10.', u"This creates a visually pleasing smile-like face on upper half of the watch, in addition to enclosing the manufacturer's name.", u'Digital displays often show a time of 12:08, where the increase in the number of active segments or pixels gives a positive feeling.', u'==== Tactile ====\nTissot, a Swiss luxury watchmaker, makes the Silen-T wristwatch with a touch-sensitive face that vibrates to help the user to tell time eyes-free.', u'The bezel of the watch features raised bumps at each hour mark; after briefly touching the face of the watch, the wearer runs a finger around the bezel clockwise.', u'When the finger reaches the bump indicating the hour, the watch vibrates continuously, and when the finger reaches the bump indicating the minute, the watch vibrates intermittently.', u'Eone Timepieces, Washington D.C.-based company, launched its first tactile analog wristwatch, the "Bradley", on 11 July 2013 on the Kickstarter website.', u"The device is primarily designed for sight-impaired users, who can use the watch's two ball bearings to determine the time, but it is also suitable for general use.", u'The watch features raised marks at each hour and two moving, magnetically attached ball bearings.', u'One ball bearing, on the edge of the watch, indicates the hour, while the other, on the face, indicates the minute.', u'=== Digital ===\n\nA digital display simply shows the time as a number, e.g., 12:08 instead of a short hand pointing towards the number 12 and a long hand 8/60 of the way round the dial.', u'The digits are usually shown as a seven-segment display.', u'The first digital mechanical pocket watches appeared in the late 19th century.', u'In the 1920s, the first digital mechanical wristwatches appeared.', u'The first digital electronic watch, a Pulsar LED prototype in 1970, was developed jointly by Hamilton Watch Company and Electro-Data, founded by George H. Thiess.', u"John Bergey, the head of Hamilton's Pulsar division, said that he was inspired to make a digital timepiece by the then-futuristic digital clock that Hamilton themselves made for the 1968 science fiction film 2001: A Space Odyssey.", u'On 4 April 1972, the Pulsar was finally ready, made in 18-carat gold and sold for $2,100.', u'It had a red light-emitting diode (LED) display.', u'Digital LED watches were very expensive and out of reach to the common consumer until 1975, when Texas Instruments started to mass-produce LED watches inside a plastic case.', u'These watches, which first retailed for only $20, reduced to $10 in 1976, saw Pulsar lose $6 million and the Pulsar brand sold to Seiko.', u'An early LED watch that was rather problematic was The Black Watch made and sold by British company Sinclair Research in 1975.', u'This was only sold for a few years, as production problems and returned (faulty) product forced the company to cease production.', u'Most watches with LED displays required that the user press a button to see the time displayed for a few seconds, because LEDs used so much power that they could not be kept operating continuously.', u'Usually the LED display color would be red.', u'Watches with LED displays were popular for a few years, but soon the LED displays were superseded by liquid crystal displays (LCDs), which used less battery power and were much more convenient in use, with the display always visible and no need to push a button before seeing the time.', u'Only in darkness you had to press a button to light the display with a tiny light bulb, later illuminating LEDs.', u'The first LCD watch with a six-digit LCD was the 1973 Seiko 06LC, although various forms of early LCD watches with a four-digit display were marketed as early as 1972 including the 1972 Gruen Teletime LCD Watch, and the Cox Electronic Systems Quarza.', u'In Switzerland, Ebauches Electronic SA presented a prototype eight-digit LCD wristwatch showing time and date at the MUBA Fair, Basle, in March 1973, using a Twisted Nematic LCD manufactured by Brown, Boveri & Cie, Switzerland, which became the supplier of LCDs to Casio for the CASIOTRON watch in 1974.', u'A problem with Liquid Crystal Displays is that they use polarized light.', u'If, for example, the user is wearing polarized sunglasses, the watch may be difficult to read because the plane of polarization of the display is roughly perpendicular to that of the glasses.', u'If the light that illuminates the display is polarized, for example if it comes from a blue sky, the display may be difficult or impossible to read.', u'From the 1980s onward, digital watch technology vastly improved.', u'In 1982 Seiko produced the Seiko TV Watch  that had a television screen built in, and Casio produced a digital watch with a thermometer as well as another that could translate 1,500 Japanese words into English.', u'In 1985, Casio produced the CFX-400 scientific calculator watch.', u'In 1987 Casio produced a watch that could dial your telephone number and Citizen revealed one that would react to your voice.', u'In 1995 Timex released a watch which allowed the wearer to download and store data from a computer to their wrist.', u'Some watches, such as the Timex Datalink USB, feature dot matrix displays.', u'Since their apex during the late 1980s to mid-1990s high technology fad, digital watches have mostly become simpler, less expensive time pieces with little variety between models.', u'=== Illuminated ===\n\nMany watches have displays that are illuminated, so they can be used in darkness.', u'Various methods have been used to achieve this.', u'Mechanical watches often have luminous paint on their hands and hour marks.', u'In the mid-20th century, radioactive material was often incorporated in the paint, so it would continue to glow without any exposure to light.', u'Radium was often used but produced small amounts of radiation outside the watch that might have been hazardous.', u'Tritium was used as a replacement, since the radiation it produces has such low energy that it cannot penetrate a watch glass.', u'However, tritium is expensive \u2014 it has to be made in a nuclear reactor \u2014 and it has a half-life of only about 12 years so the paint remains luminous for only a few years.', u'Nowadays, tritium is used in specialized watches, e.g., for military purposes (See Tritium illumination).', u'For other purposes, luminous paint is sometimes used on analog displays, but no radioactive material is contained in it.', u'This means that the display glows soon after being exposed to light and quickly fades.', u'Watches that incorporate batteries often have electric illumination of their displays.', u'However, lights consume far more power than electronic watch movements.', u'To conserve the battery, the light is activated only when the user presses a button.', u'Usually, the light remains lit for a few seconds after the button is released, which allows the user to move the hand out of the way.', u'In some early digital watches, LED displays were used, which could be read as easily in darkness as in daylight.', u'The user had to press a button to light up the LEDs, which meant that the watch could not be read without the button being pressed, even in full daylight.', u'In some cheaper types of watches, small incandescent lamps or LEDs illuminate the display, which is not intrinsically luminous.', u'These tend to produce very non-uniform illumination.', u'Incandescent lamps are very wasteful of electricity.', u'Other watches use electroluminescent material to produce uniform illumination of the background of the display, against which the hands or digits can be seen.', u'== Speech synthesis ==\nTalking watches are available, intended for the blind or visually impaired.', u'They speak the time out loud at the press of a button.', u'This has the disadvantage of disturbing others nearby, or at least alerting the non-deaf that the wearer is checking the time.', u'Tactile watches are preferred to avoid this awkwardness, but talking watches are preferred for those who are not confident in their ability to read a tactile watch reliably.', u'== Handedness ==\nWristwatches with analog displays generally have a small knob, called the crown, that can be used to adjust the time and, in mechanical watches, wind the spring.', u'Almost always, the crown is located on the right-hand side of the watch.', u'This makes it inconvenient to use if the watch is being worn on the right wrist.', u'In exceptional cases, the crown is on the left side of the watch.', u'This is, for example, to prevent it from digging into the wrists of golf players.', u'Digital watches generally have push-buttons that can be used to make adjustments.', u'These are usually equally easy to use on either wrist.', u'== Functions ==\n\nAll watches provide the time of day, giving at least the hour and minute, and usually the second.', u'Most also provide the current date, and often the day of the week as well.', u'However, many watches also provide a great deal of information beyond the basics of time and date.', u'Some watches include alarms.', u'Other elaborate and more expensive watches, both pocket and wrist models, also incorporate striking mechanisms or repeater functions, so that the wearer could learn the time by the sound emanating from the watch.', u'This announcement or striking feature is an essential characteristic of true clocks and distinguishes such watches from ordinary timepieces.', u'This feature is available on most digital watches.', u'A complicated watch has one or more functions beyond the basic function of displaying the time and the date; such a functionality is called a complication.', u'Two popular complications are the chronograph complication, which is the ability of the watch movement to function as a stopwatch, and the moonphase complication, which is a display of the lunar phase.', u'Other more expensive complications include Tourbillon, Perpetual calendar, Minute repeater, and Equation of time.', u'A truly complicated watch has many of these complications at once (see Calibre 89 from Patek Philippe for instance).', u'Some watches can both indicate the direction of Mecca and have alarms that can be set for all daily prayer requirements.', u'Among watch enthusiasts, complicated watches are especially collectible.', u'Some watches include a second 12-hour or 24-hour display for UTC or GMT.', u'The similar-sounding terms chronograph and chronometer are often confused, although they mean altogether different things.', u'A chronograph is a watch with an added duration timer, often a stopwatch complication (as explained above), while a chronometer watch is a timepiece that has met an industry standard test for performance under pre-defined conditions: a chronometer is a high quality mechanical or a thermo-compensated movement that has been tested and certified to operate within a certain standard of accuracy by the COSC (Contr\xf4le Officiel Suisse des Chronom\xe8tres).', u'The concepts are different but not mutually exclusive; so a watch can be a chronograph, a chronometer, both, or neither.', u'Many computerized wristwatches have been developed, but none have had long-term sales success, because they have awkward user interfaces due to the tiny screens and buttons, and a short battery life.', u'As miniaturized electronics became cheaper, watches have been developed containing calculators, tonometers, barometers, altimeters, a compass using both hands to show the N/S direction, video games, digital cameras, keydrives, GPS receivers and cellular phones.', u'A few astronomical watches show phase of the Moon and other celestial phenomena.', u'In the early 1980s Seiko marketed a watch with a television in it.', u'Such watches have also had the reputation as unsightly and thus mainly geek toys.', u'Several companies have however attempted to develop a computer contained in a wristwatch (see also wearable computer).', u'Electronic sports watches, combining timekeeping with GPS and/or activity tracking, address the general fitness market and have the potential for commercial success (Garmin forerunner, Garmin Vivofit, Epson, announced model of Swatch Touch series).', u'Braille watches have analog displays with raised bumps around the face to allow blind users to tell the time.', u'Their digital equivalents use synthesised speech to speak the time on command.', u'=== Fashion ===\nWristwatches and antique pocket watches are often appreciated as jewelry or as collectible works of art rather than just as timepieces.', u'This has created several different markets for wristwatches, ranging from very inexpensive but accurate watches (intended for no other purpose than telling the correct time) to extremely expensive watches that serve mainly as personal adornment or as examples of high achievement in miniaturization and precision mechanical engineering.', u"Traditionally, men's dress watches appropriate for informal (business), semi-formal, and formal attire are gold, thin, simple, and plain, but increasingly rugged, complicated, or sports watches are considered by some to be acceptable for such attire.", u"Some dress watches have a cabochon on the crown and many women's dress watches have faceted gemstones on the face, bezel, or bracelet.", u'Some are made entirely of faceted sapphire (corundum).', u'Many fashion and department stores offer a variety of less-expensive, trendy, "costume" watches (usually for women), many of which are similar in quality to basic quartz timepieces but which feature bolder designs.', u'In the 1980s, the Swiss Swatch company hired graphic designers to redesign a new annual collection of non-repairable watches.', u'Trade in counterfeit watches, which mimic expensive brand-name watches, constitutes an estimated US$1 billion market per year.', u'=== Space ===\n\nThe zero-gravity environment and other extreme conditions encountered by astronauts in space require the use of specially tested watches.', u'The first ever watch to be sent into space was a Russian "Pobeda" watch from the Petrodvorets Watch Factory.', u'It was sent on a single orbit flight on the space ship Korabl-Sputnik 4 on March 9, 1961.', u"The watch had been attached without authorisation to the wrist of Chernuchka, a dog that successfully did exactly the same trip as Yuri Gagarin, with exactly the same rocket and equipment, just a month before Gagarin's flight.", u'On 12 April 1961, Yuri Gagarin wore a Shturmanskie (a transliteration of \u0428\u0442\u0443\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 which actually means "navigator\'s") wristwatch during his historic first flight into space.', u'The Shturmanskie was manufactured at the First Moscow Factory.', u'Since 1964, the watches of the First Moscow Factory have been marked by the trademark "\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0451\u0442", transliterated as "POLJOT", which means "flight" in Russian and is a tribute to the many space trips its watches have accomplished.', u'In the late 1970s, Poljot launched a new chrono movement, the 3133.', u'With a 23 jewel movement and manual winding (43 hours), it was a modified Russian version of the Swiss Valjoux 7734 of the early 1970s.', u'Poljot 3133 were taken into space by astronauts from Russia, France, Germany and Ukraine.', u'On the arm of Valeriy Polyakov, a Poljot 3133 chronograph movement-based watch set a space record for the longest space flight in history.', u'Through the 1960s, a large range of watches were tested for durability and precision under extreme temperature changes and vibrations.', u'The Omega Speedmaster Professional was selected by NASA, the U.S. space agency.', u'Heuer became the first Swiss watch in space thanks to a Heuer Stopwatch, worn by John Glenn in 1962 when he piloted the Friendship 7 on the first manned U.S. orbital mission.', u'The Breitling Navitimer Cosmonaute was designed with a 24-hour analog dial to avoid confusion between AM and PM, which are meaningless in space.', u'It was first worn in space by U.S. astronaut Scott Carpenter on 24 May 1962 in the Aurora 7 mercury capsule.', u'Since 1994 Fortis is the exclusive supplier for manned space missions authorized by the Russian Federal Space Agency.', u'China National Space Administration (CNSA) astronauts wear the Fiyta spacewatches.', u'At BaselWorld, 2008, Seiko announced the creation of the first watch ever designed specifically for a space walk, Spring Drive Spacewalk.', u'Timex Datalink is flight certified by NASA for space missions and is one of the watches qualified by NASA for space travel.', u'The Casio G-Shock DW-5600C and 5600E, DW 6900, and DW 5900 are Flight-Qualified for NASA space travel.', u'Various Timex Datalink models were used both by cosmonauts and astronauts.', u'=== Scuba diving ===\n\nWatches may be crafted to become water resistant.', u'These watches are sometimes called diving watches when they are suitable for scuba diving or saturation diving.', u'The International Organization for Standardization issued a standard for water resistant watches which also prohibits the term "waterproof" to be used with watches, which many countries have adopted.', u'Water resistance is achieved by the gaskets which forms a watertight seal, used in conjunction with a sealant applied on the case to help keep water out.', u'The material of the case must also be tested in order to pass as water resistant.', u'None of the tests defined by ISO 2281 for the Water Resistant mark are suitable to qualify a watch for scuba diving.', u'Such watches are designed for everyday life and must be water resistant during exercises such as swimming.', u'They can be worn in different temperature and pressure conditions but are under no circumstances designed for scuba diving.', u'The standards for diving watches are regulated by the ISO 6425 international standard.', u'The watches are tested in static or still water under 125% of the rated (water)pressure, thus a watch with a 200-metre rating will be water resistant if it is stationary and under 250 metres of static water.', u'The testing of the water resistance is fundamentally different from non-dive watches, because every watch has to be fully tested.', u"Besides water resistance standards to a minimum of 100 metre depth rating ISO 6425 also provides eight minimum requirements for mechanical diver's watches for scuba diving (quartz and digital watches have slightly differing readability requirements).", u"For diver's watches for mixed-gas saturation diving two additional requirements have to be met.", u'Watches are classified by their degree of water resistance, which roughly translates to the following (1 metre = 3.281 feet):\nSome watches use bar instead of meters, which may then be multiplied by 10, and then subtract 10 to be approximately equal to the rating based on metres.', u'Therefore, a 5 bar watch is equivalent to a 40-metre watch.', u'Some watches are rated in atmospheres (atm), which are roughly equivalent to bar.', u'=== Navigation ===\n\nThere is a traditional method by which an analog watch can be used to locate north and south.', u'The Sun appears to move in the sky over a 24-hour period while the hour hand of a 12-hour clock face takes twelve hours to complete one rotation.', u"In the northern hemisphere, if the watch is rotated so that the hour hand points toward the Sun, the point halfway between the hour hand and 12 o'clock will indicate south.", u"For this method to work in the southern hemisphere, the 12 is pointed toward the Sun and the point halfway between the hour hand and 12 o'clock will indicate north.", u"During daylight saving time, the same method can be employed using 1 o'clock instead of 12.", u'This method is accurate enough to be useful only at fairly high latitudes.', u'== See also ==\nAmerican Watchmakers-Clockmakers Institute\nCoin watch\nList of watch manufacturers\nMarine chronometer\nNational Association of Watch and Clock

{'sentences': [u'A treaty is an agreement under international law entered into by actors in international law, namely sovereign states and international organizations.', u'A treaty may also be known as an (international) agreement, protocol, covenant, convention, pact, or exchange of letters, among other terms.', u'Regardless of terminology, all of these forms of agreements are, under international law, equally considered treaties and the rules are the same.', u'Treaties can be loosely compared to contracts: both are means of willing parties assuming obligations among themselves, and a party to either that fails to live up to their obligations can be held liable under international law.', u'== Modern usage ==\nA treaty is an official, express written agreement that states use to legally bind themselves.', u'A treaty is the official document which expresses that agreement in words; and it is also the objective outcome of a ceremonial occasion which acknowledges the parties and their defined relationships.', u'== Modern form ==\nSince the late 19th century, most treaties have followed a fairly consistent format.', u'A treaty typically begins with a preamble describing the contracting parties and their joint objectives in executing the treaty, as well as summarizing any underlying events (such as a war).', u'Modern preambles are sometimes structured as a single very long sentence formatted into multiple paragraphs for readability, in which each of the paragraphs begins with a verb (desiring, recognizing, having, and so on).', u"The contracting parties' full names or sovereign titles are often included in the preamble, along with the full names and titles of their representatives, and a boilerplate clause about how their representatives have communicated (or exchanged) their full powers (i.e., the official documents appointing them to act on behalf of their respective states) and found them in good or proper form.", u'The end of the preamble and the start of the actual agreement is often signaled by the words "have agreed as follows."', u"After the preamble comes numbered articles, which contain the substance of the parties' actual agreement.", u'Each article heading usually encompasses a paragraph.', u'A long treaty may further group articles under chapter headings.', u'Modern treaties, regardless of subject matter, usually contain articles governing where the final authentic copies of the treaty will be deposited and how any subsequent disputes as to their interpretation will be peacefully resolved.', u'The end of a treaty, the eschatocol (or closing protocol), is often signaled by a clause like "in witness whereof" or "in faith whereof," the parties have affixed their signatures, followed by the words "DONE at," then the site(s) of the treaty\'s execution and the date(s) of its execution.', u'The date is typically written in its most formal, longest possible form.', u'For example, the Charter of the United Nations was "DONE at the city of San Francisco the twenty-sixth day of June, one thousand nine hundred and forty-five."', u'If the treaty is executed in multiple copies in different languages, that fact is always noted, and is followed by a stipulation that the versions in different languages are equally authentic.', u"The signatures of the parties' representatives follow at the very end.", u'When the text of a treaty is later reprinted, such as in a collection of treaties currently in effect, an editor will often append the dates on which the respective parties ratified the treaty and on which it came into effect for each party.', u'== Bilateral and Multilateral Treaties ==\nBilateral treaties are concluded between two states or entities.', u'It is possible, however, for a bilateral treaty to have more than two parties; consider for instance the bilateral treaties between Switzerland and the European Union (EU) following the Swiss rejection of the European Economic Area agreement.', u'Each of these treaties has seventeen parties.', u'These however are still bilateral, not multilateral, treaties.', u'The parties are divided into two groups, the Swiss ("on the one part") and the EU and its member states ("on the other part").', u'The treaty establishes rights and obligations between the Swiss and the EU and the member states severally\u2014it does not establish any rights and obligations amongst the EU and its member states.', u'A multilateral treaty is concluded among several countries.', u'The agreement establishes rights and obligations between each party and every other party.', u'Multilateral treaties are often regional.', u'Treaties of "mutual guarantee" are international compacts, e.g., the Treaty of Locarno which guarantees each signatory against attack from another.', u"== Adding and amending treaty obligations ==\n\n\n=== Reservations ===\n\nReservations are essentially caveats to a state's acceptance of a treaty.", u'Reservations are unilateral statements purporting to exclude or to modify the legal obligation and its effects on the reserving state.', u'These must be included at the time of signing or ratification, i.e.', u'"a party cannot add a reservation after it has already joined a treaty".', u'Originally, international law was unaccepting of treaty reservations, rejecting them unless all parties to the treaty accepted the same reservations.', u'However, in the interest of encouraging the largest number of states to join treaties, a more permissive rule regarding reservations has emerged.', u'While some treaties still expressly forbid any reservations, they are now generally permitted to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the goals and purposes of the treaty.', u'When a state limits its treaty obligations through reservations, other states party to that treaty have the option to accept those reservations, object to them, or object and oppose them.', u"If the state accepts them (or fails to act at all), both the reserving state and the accepting state are relieved of the reserved legal obligation as concerns their legal obligations to each other (accepting the reservation does not change the accepting state's legal obligations as concerns other parties to the treaty).", u'If the state opposes, the parts of the treaty affected by the reservation drop out completely and no longer create any legal obligations on the reserving and accepting state, again only as concerns each other.', u'Finally, if the state objects and opposes, there are no legal obligations under that treaty between those two state parties whatsoever.', u'The objecting and opposing state essentially refuses to acknowledge the reserving state is a party to the treaty at all.', u'=== Amendments ===\nThere are three ways an existing treaty can be amended.', u'First, formal amendment requires State parties to the treaty to go through the ratification process all over again.', u'The re-negotiation of treaty provisions can be long and protracted, and often some parties to the original treaty will not become parties to the amended treaty.', u'When determining the legal obligations of states, one party to the original treaty and one a party to the amended treaty, the states will only be bound by the terms they both agreed upon.', u'Treaties can also be amended informally by the treaty executive council when the changes are only procedural, technical change in customary international law can also amend a treaty, where state behavior evinces a new interpretation of the legal obligations under the treaty.', u'Minor corrections to a treaty may be adopted by a proc\xe8s-verbal; but a proc\xe8s-verbal is generally reserved for changes to rectify obvious errors in the text adopted, i.e.', u'where the text adopted does not correctly reflect the intention of the parties adopting it.', u'=== Protocols ===\n\nIn international law and international relations, a protocol is generally a treaty or international agreement that supplements a previous treaty or international agreement.', u'A protocol can amend the previous treaty, or add additional provisions.', u'Parties to the earlier agreement are not required to adopt the protocol.', u'Sometimes this is made clearer by calling it an "optional protocol", especially where many parties to the first agreement do not support the protocol.', u'Some examples: the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) established a framework for the development of binding greenhouse gas emission limits, while the Kyoto Protocol contained the specific provisions and regulations later agreed upon.', u"== Execution and implementation ==\nTreaties may be seen as 'self-executing', in that merely becoming a party puts the treaty and all of its obligations in action.", u"Other treaties may be non-self-executing and require 'implementing legislation'\u2014a change in the domestic law of a state party that will direct or enable it to fulfill treaty obligations.", u'An example of a treaty requiring such legislation would be one mandating local prosecution by a party for particular crimes.', u'The division between the two is often not clear and is often politicized in disagreements within a government over a treaty, since a non-self-executing treaty cannot be acted on without the proper change in domestic law.', u'If a treaty requires implementing legislation, a state may be in default of its obligations by the failure of its legislature to pass the necessary domestic laws.', u'=== Interpretation ===\nThe language of treaties, like that of any law or contract, must be interpreted when the wording does not seem clear or it is not immediately apparent how it should be applied in a perhaps unforeseen circumstance.', u'The Vienna Convention states that treaties are to be interpreted "in good faith" according to the "ordinary meaning given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose."', u"International legal experts also often invoke the 'principle of maximum effectiveness,' which interprets treaty language as having the fullest force and effect possible to establish obligations between the parties.", u'No one party to a treaty can impose its particular interpretation of the treaty upon the other parties.', u'Consent may be implied, however, if the other parties fail to explicitly disavow that initially unilateral interpretation, particularly if that state has acted upon its view of the treaty without complaint.', u"Consent by all parties to the treaty to a particular interpretation has the legal effect of adding another clause to the treaty \u2013 this is commonly called an 'authentic interpretation'.", u'International tribunals and arbiters are often called upon to resolve substantial disputes over treaty interpretations.', u'To establish the meaning in context, these judicial bodies may review the preparatory work from the negotiation and drafting of the treaty as well as the final, signed treaty itself.', u'=== Consequences of terminology ===\nOne significant part of treaty making is that signing a treaty implies recognition that the other side is a sovereign state and that the agreement being considered is enforceable under international law.', u'Hence, nations can be very careful about terming an agreement to be a treaty.', u'For example, within the United States, agreements between states are compacts and agreements between states and the federal government or between agencies of the government are memoranda of understanding.', u'Another situation can occur when one party wishes to create an obligation under international law, but the other party does not.', u'This factor has been at work with respect to discussions between North Korea and the United States over security guarantees and nuclear proliferation.', u'The terminology can also be confusing because a treaty may and usually is named something other than a treaty, such as a convention, protocol, or simply agreement.', u'Conversely some legal documents such as the Treaty of Waitangi are internationally considered to be documents under domestic law.', u'== Ending treaty obligations ==\n\n\n=== Withdrawal ===\nTreaties are not necessarily permanently binding upon the signatory parties.', u'As obligations in international law are traditionally viewed as arising only from the consent of states, many treaties expressly allow a state to withdraw as long as it follows certain procedures of notification.', u'For example, the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs provides that the treaty will terminate if, as a result of denunciations, the number of parties falls below 40.', u'Many treaties expressly forbid withdrawal.', u'Article 56 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties provides that where a treaty is silent over whether or not it can be denounced there is a rebuttable presumption that it cannot be unilaterally denounced unless:\nit can be shown that the parties intended to admit the possibility, or\na right of withdrawal can be inferred from the terms of the treaty.', u'The possibility of withdrawal depends on the terms of the treaty and its travaux preparatoire.', u'It has, for example, been held that it is not possible to withdraw from the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.', u'When North Korea declared its intention to do this the Secretary-General of the United Nations, acting as registrar, said that original signatories of the ICCPR had not overlooked the possibility of explicitly providing for withdrawal, but rather had deliberately intended not to provide for it.', u'Consequently, withdrawal was not possible.', u'In practice, because of sovereignty, any state can purport to withdraw from any treaty at any time, and cease to abide by its terms.', u'The question of whether this is lawful can be regarded as the success or failure to anticipate community acquiescence or enforcement, that is, how other states will react; for instance, another state might impose sanctions or go to war over a treaty violation.', u"If a state party's withdrawal is successful, its obligations under that treaty are considered terminated, and withdrawal by one party from a bilateral treaty of course terminates the treaty.", u'When a state withdraws from a multi-lateral treaty, that treaty will still otherwise remain in force among the other parties, unless, of course, otherwise should or could be interpreted as agreed upon between the remaining states parties to the treaty.', u'=== Suspension and termination ===\nIf a party has materially violated or breached its treaty obligations, the other parties may invoke this breach as grounds for temporarily suspending their obligations to that party under the treaty.', u'A material breach may also be invoked as grounds for permanently terminating the treaty itself.', u'A treaty breach does not automatically suspend or terminate treaty relations, however.', u'It depends on how the other parties regard the breach and how they resolve to respond to it.', u'Sometimes treaties will provide for the seriousness of a breach to be determined by a tribunal or other independent arbiter.', u"An advantage of such an arbiter is that it prevents a party from prematurely and perhaps wrongfully suspending or terminating its own obligations due to another's alleged material breach.", u'Treaties sometimes include provisions for self-termination, meaning that the treaty is automatically terminated if certain defined conditions are met.', u'Some treaties are intended by the parties to be only temporarily binding and are set to expire on a given date.', u'Other treaties may self-terminate if the treaty is meant to exist only under certain conditions.', u'A party may claim that a treaty should be terminated, even absent an express provision, if there has been a fundamental change in circumstances.', u'Such a change is sufficient if unforeseen, if it undermined the \u201cessential basis\u201d of consent by a party, if it radically transforms the extent of obligations between the parties, and if the obligations are still to be performed.', u'A party cannot base this claim on change brought about by its own breach of the treaty.', u'This claim also cannot be used to invalidate treaties that established or redrew political boundaries.', u'== Invalid treaties ==\nThere are several reasons an otherwise valid and agreed upon treaty may be rejected as a binding international agreement, most of which involve problems created at the formation of the treaty.', u'For example, the serial Japan-Korea treaties of 1905, 1907 and 1910 were protested; and they were confirmed as "already null and void" in the 1965 Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea.', u"=== Ultra vires treaties ===\nA party's consent to a treaty is invalid if it had been given by an agent or body without power to do so under that state's domestic law.", u'States are reluctant to inquire into the internal affairs and processes of other states, and so a "manifest violation" is required such that it would be "objectively evident to any State dealing with the matter".', u'A strong presumption exists internationally that a head of state has acted within his proper authority.', u'It seems that no treaty has ever actually been invalidated on this provision.', u'Consent is also invalid if it is given by a representative who ignored restrictions he is subject to by his sovereign during the negotiations, if the other parties to the treaty were notified of those restrictions prior to his signing.', u'According to the preamble in The Law of Treaties, treaties are a source of international law.', u'If an act or lack thereof is condemned under international law, the act will not assume international legality even if approved by internal law.', u'This means that in case of a conflict with domestic law, international law will always prevail.', u'=== Misunderstanding, fraud, corruption, coercion ===\nArticles 46\u201353 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties set out the only ways that treaties can be invalidated\u2014considered unenforceable and void under international law.', u'A treaty will be invalidated due to either the circumstances by which a state party joined the treaty, or due to the content of the treaty itself.', u'Invalidation is separate from withdrawal, suspension, or termination (addressed above), which all involve an alteration in the consent of the parties of a previously valid treaty rather than the invalidation of that consent in the first place.', u'A state\'s consent may be invalidated if there was an erroneous understanding of a fact or situation at the time of conclusion, which formed the "essential basis" of the state\'s consent.', u"Consent will not be invalidated if the misunderstanding was due to the state's own conduct, or if the truth should have been evident.", u'Consent will also be invalidated if it was induced by the fraudulent conduct of another party, or by the direct or indirect "corruption" of its representative by another party to the treaty.', u'Coercion of either a representative, or the state itself through the threat or use of force, if used to obtain the consent of that state to a treaty, will invalidate that consent.', u'=== Contrary to peremptory norms ===\nA treaty is null and void if it is in violation of a peremptory norm.', u'These norms, unlike other principles of customary law, are recognized as permitting no violations and so cannot be altered through treaty obligations.', u'These are limited to such universally accepted prohibitions as those against the aggressive use of force, genocide and other crimes against humanity, piracy, hostilities directed at civilian population, racial discrimination and apartheid, slavery and torture, meaning that no state can legally assume an obligation to commit or permit such acts.', u'== Role of the United Nations ==\nThe United Nations Charter states that treaties must be registered with the UN to be invoked before it or enforced in its judiciary organ, the International Court of Justice.', u'This was done to prevent the proliferation of secret treaties that occurred in the 19th and 20th century.', u"Section 103 of the Charter also states that its members' obligations under it outweigh any competing obligations under other treaties.", u'After their adoption, treaties as well as their amendments have to follow the official legal procedures of the United Nations, as applied by the Office of Legal Affairs, including signature, ratification and entry into force.', u'In function and effectiveness, the UN has been compared to the pre-Constitutional United States Federal government by some, giving a comparison between modern treaty law and the historical Articles of Confederation.', u'== Relation between national law and treaties by country ==\n\n\n=== Brazilian law ===\nThe Brazilian federal constitution states that the power to enter into treaties is vested in the president and that such treaties must be approved by Congress (articles 84, clause VIII, and 49, clause I).', u'In practice, this has been interpreted as meaning that the executive branch is free to negotiate and sign a treaty, but its ratification by the president is contingent upon the prior approval of Congress.', u'Additionally, the Federal Supreme Court has ruled that, following ratification and entry into force, a treaty must be incorporated into domestic law by means of a presidential decree published in the federal register in order to be valid in Brazil and applicable by the Brazilian authorities.', u'The Federal Supreme Court has established that treaties are subject to constitutional review and enjoy the same hierarchical position as ordinary legislation (leis ordin\xe1rias, or "ordinary laws", in Portuguese).', u'A more recent ruling by the Supreme Court in 2008 has altered that scheme somewhat, by stating that treaties containing human rights provisions enjoy a status above that of ordinary legislation, though they remain beneath the constitution itself.', u'Additionally, as per the 45th amendment to the constitution, human rights treaties which are approved by Congress by means of a special procedure enjoy the same hierarchical position as a constitutional amendment.', u'The hierarchical position of treaties in relation to domestic legislation is of relevance to the discussion on whether (and how) the latter can abrogate the former and vice versa.', u'The Brazilian federal constitution does not have a supremacy clause with the same effects as the one on the U.S. constitution, a fact that is of interest to the discussion on the relation between treaties and state legislation.', u'=== United States law ===\n\nIn the United States, the term "treaty" has a different, more restricted legal sense than exists in international law.', u'United States law distinguishes what it calls treaties from executive agreement, congressional-executive agreements, and sole executive agreements.', u'All four classes are equally treaties under international law; they are distinct only from the perspective of internal American law.', u'The distinctions are primarily concerning their method of approval.', u'Whereas treaties require advice and consent by two-thirds of the Senators present, sole executive agreements may be executed by the President acting alone.', u'Some treaties grant the President the authority to fill in the gaps with executive agreements, rather than additional treaties or protocols.', u'And finally, congressional-executive agreements require majority approval by both the House and the Senate, either before or after the treaty is signed by the President.', u'Currently, international agreements are executed by executive agreement rather than treaties at a rate of 10:1.', u'Despite the relative ease of executive agreements, the President still often chooses to pursue the formal treaty process over an executive agreement in order to gain congressional support on matters that require the Congress to pass implementing legislation or appropriate funds, and those agreements that impose long-term, complex legal obligations on the United States.', u'For example, the deal by the United States, Iran and other countries is not a Treaty.', u'See the article on the Bricker Amendment

{'sentences': [u'A rocket engine is a type of jet engine that uses only stored rocket propellant mass for forming its high speed propulsive jet.', u"Rocket engines are reaction engines, obtaining thrust in accordance with Newton's third law.", u'Most rocket engines are internal combustion engines, although non-combusting forms (such as cold gas thrusters) also exist.', u'Vehicles propelled by rocket engines are commonly called rockets.', u'Since they need no external material to form their jet, rocket engines can perform in a vacuum and thus can be used to propel spacecraft and ballistic missiles.', u'Compared to other types of jet engines, rocket engines have the highest thrust, are by far the lightest, but are the least propellant efficient (have the lowest specific impulse).', u'The ideal exhaust is hydrogen, the lightest of all gases, but chemical rockets produce a mix of heavier species, reducing the exhaust velocity.', u'Rocket engines become more efficient at high velocities (due to greater propulsive efficiency and Oberth effect).', u'Since they do not require an atmosphere, they are well suited for uses at very high altitude and in space.', u'== Terminology ==\nHere, "rocket" is used as an abbreviation for "rocket engine".', u'Chemical rockets are powered by exothermic chemical reactions of the propellant.', u'Thermal rockets use an inert propellant, heated by a power source such as electric or nuclear power.', u'Solid-fuel rockets (or solid-propellant rockets or motors) are chemical rockets which use propellant in a solid state.', u'Liquid-propellant rockets use one or more liquid propellants fed from tanks.', u'Hybrid rockets use a solid propellant in the combustion chamber, to which a second liquid or gas oxidiser or propellant is added to permit combustion.', u'Monopropellant rockets use a single propellant decomposed by a catalyst.', u'The most common monopropellants are hydrazine and hydrogen peroxide.', u'== Principle of operation ==\nRocket engines produce thrust by the expulsion of an exhaust fluid which has been accelerated to a high speed through a propelling nozzle.', u'The fluid is usually a gas created by high pressure (150-to-2,900-pound-per-square-inch (10 to 200 bar)) combustion of solid or liquid propellants, consisting of fuel and oxidiser components, within a combustion chamber.', u'The nozzle uses the heat energy released by expansion of the gas to accelerate the exhaust to very high (supersonic) speed, and the reaction to this pushes the engine in the opposite direction.', u'Combustion is most frequently used for practical rockets, as high temperatures and pressures are desirable for the best performance, permitting a longer nozzle, giving higher exhaust speeds and better thermodynamic efficiency.', u'An alternative to combustion is the water rocket, which uses water pressurised by compressed air, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, or manual pumping, for model rocketry.', u'=== Propellant ===\nRocket propellant is mass that is stored, usually in some form of propellant tank, or within the combustion chamber itself, prior to being ejected from a rocket engine in the form of a fluid jet to produce thrust.', u'Chemical rocket propellants are most commonly used, which undergo exothermic chemical reactions which produce hot gas which is used by a rocket for propulsive purposes.', u'Alternatively, a chemically inert reaction mass can be heated using a high-energy power source via a heat exchanger, and then no combustion chamber is used.', u"Solid rocket propellants are prepared as a mixture of fuel and oxidising components called 'grain' and the propellant storage casing effectively becomes the combustion chamber.", u'=== Injection ===\nLiquid-fuelled rockets force separate fuel and oxidiser components into the combustion chamber, where they mix and burn.', u'Hybrid rocket engines use a combination of solid and liquid or gaseous propellants.', u'Both liquid and hybrid rockets use injectors to introduce the propellant into the chamber.', u'These are often an array of simple jets - holes through which the propellant escapes under pressure; but sometimes may be more complex spray nozzles.', u'When two or more propellants are injected, the jets usually deliberately cause the propellants to collide as this breaks up the flow into smaller droplets that burn more easily.', u'=== Combustion chamber ===\n\nFor chemical rockets the combustion chamber is typically just a cylinder, and flame holders are rarely used.', u'The dimensions of the cylinder are such that the propellant is able to combust thoroughly; different rocket propellants require different combustion chamber sizes for this to occur.', u'This leads to a

combination of temperatures and pressures typically reached in a combustion chamber is usually extreme by any standards.', u'Unlike in airbreathing jet engines, no atmospheric nitrogen is present to dilute and cool the combustion, and the temperature can reach true stoichiometric ratios.', u'This, in combination with the high pressures, means that the rate of heat conduction through the walls is very high.', u'=== Nozzle ===\n\nThe hot gas produced in the combustion chamber is permitted to escape through an opening (the "throat"), and then through a diverging expansion section.', u'When sufficient pressure is provided to the nozzle (about 2.5-3 times ambient pressure), the nozzle chokes and a supersonic jet is formed, dramatically accelerating the gas, converting most of the thermal energy into kinetic energy.', u'Exhaust speeds vary, depending on the expansion ratio the nozzle is designed for, but exhaust speeds as high as ten times the speed of sound in air at sea level are not uncommon.', u"About half of the rocket engine's thrust comes from the unbalanced pressures inside the combustion chamber, and the rest comes from the pressures acting against the inside of the nozzle (see diagram).", u"As the gas expands (adiabatically) the pressure against the nozzle's walls forces the rocket engine in one direction while accelerating the gas in the other.", u'The most commonly used nozzle is the de Laval nozzle, a fixed geometry nozzle with a high expansion-ratio.', u'The large bell- or cone-shaped nozzle extension beyond the throat gives the rocket engine its characteristic shape.', u'The exit static pressure of the exhaust jet depends on the chamber pressure and the ratio of exit to throat area of the nozzle.', u'As exit pressure varies from the ambient (atmospheric) pressure, a choked nozzle is said to be underexpanded (exit pressure greater than ambient), perfectly expanded (exit pressure equals ambient), overexpanded (exit pressure less than ambient; shock diamonds form outside the nozzle), or grossly overexpanded (a shock wave forms inside the nozzle extension).', u'In practice, perfect expansion is only achievable with a variable-exit area nozzle (since ambient pressure decreases as altitude increases), and is not possible above a certain altitude as ambient pressure approaches zero.', u'If the nozzle is not perfectly expanded, then loss of efficiency occurs.', u'Grossly overexpanded nozzles lose less efficiency, but can cause mechanical problems with the nozzle.', u'Fixed-area nozzles become progressively more underexpanded as they gain altitude.', u'Almost all de Laval nozzles will be momentarily grossly overexpanded during startup in an atmosphere.', u'Nozzle efficiency is affected by operation in the atmosphere because atmospheric pressure changes with altitude; but due to the supersonic speeds of the gas exiting from a rocket engine, the pressure of the jet may be either below or above ambient, and equilibrium between the two is not reached at all altitudes (see diagram).', u"==== Back pressure and optimal expansion ====\nFor optimal performance the pressure of the gas at the end of the nozzle should just equal the ambient pressure: if the exhaust's pressure is lower than the ambient pressure, then the vehicle will be slowed by the difference in pressure between the top of the engine and the exit; on the other hand, if the exhaust's pressure is higher, then exhaust pressure that could have been converted into thrust is not converted, and energy is wasted.", u"To maintain this ideal of equality between the exhaust's exit pressure and the ambient pressure, the diameter of the nozzle would need to increase with altitude, giving the pressure a longer nozzle to act on (and reducing the exit pressure and temperature).", u'This increase is difficult to arrange in a lightweight fashion, although is routinely done with other forms of jet engines.', u"In rocketry a lightweight compromise nozzle is generally used and some reduction in atmospheric performance occurs when used at other than the 'design altitude' or when throttled.", u'To improve on this, various exotic nozzle designs such as the plug nozzle, stepped nozzles, the expanding nozzle and the aerospike have been proposed, each providing some way to adapt to changing ambient air pressure and each allowing the gas to expand further against the nozzle, giving extra thrust at higher altitudes.', u'When exhausting into a sufficiently low ambient pressure (vacuum) several issues arise.', u'One is the sheer weight of the nozzle\u2014beyond a certain point, for a particular vehicle, the extra weight of the nozzle outweighs any performance gained.', u"Secondly, as the exhaust gases adiabatically expand within the nozzle they cool, and eventually some of the chemicals can freeze, producing 'snow' within the jet.", u'This causes instabilities in the jet and must be avoided.', u'On a de Laval nozzle, exhaust gas flow detachment will occur in a grossly over-expanded nozzle.', u'As the detachment point will not be uniform around the axis of the engine, a side force may be imparted to the engine.', u'This side force may change over time and result in control problems with the launch vehicle.', u'Advanced altitude-compensating designs, such as the aerospike or plug nozzle, attempt to minimize performance losses by adjusting to varying expansion ratio caused by changing altitude.', u'=== Propellant efficiency ===\n\nFor a rocket engine to be propellant efficient, it is important that the maximum pressures possible be created on the walls of the chamber and nozzle by a specific amount of propellant; as this is the source of the thrust.', u"This can be achieved by all of:\nheating the propellant to as high a temperature as possible (using a high energy fuel, containing hydrogen and carbon and sometimes metals such as aluminium, or even using nuclear energy)\nusing a low specific density gas (as hydrogen rich as possible)\nusing propellants which are, or decompose to, simple molecules with few degrees of freedom to maximise translational velocity\nSince all of these things minimise the mass of the propellant used, and since pressure is proportional to the mass of propellant present to be accelerated as it pushes on the engine, and since from Newton's third law the pressure that acts on the engine also reciprocally acts on the propellant, it turns out that for any given engine the speed that the propellant leaves the chamber is unaffected by the chamber pressure (although the thrust is proportional).", u'However, speed is significantly affected by all three of the above factors and the exhaust speed is an excellent measure of the engine propellant efficiency.', u'This is termed exhaust velocity, and after allowance is made for factors that can reduce it, the effective exhaust velocity is one of the most important parameters of a rocket engine (although weight, cost, ease of manufacture etc.', u'are usually also very important).', u'For aerodynamic reasons the flow goes sonic ("chokes") at the narrowest part of the nozzle, the \'throat\'.', u'Since the speed of sound in gases increases with the square root of temperature, the use of hot exhaust gas greatly improves performance.', u'By comparison, at room temperature the speed of sound in air is about 340 m/s while the speed of sound in the hot gas of a rocket engine can be over 1700 m/s; much of this performance is due to the higher temperature, but additionally rocket propellants are chosen to be of low molecular mass, and this also gives a higher velocity compared to air.', u'Expansion in the rocket nozzle then further multiplies the speed, typically between 1.5 and 2 times, giving a highly collimated hypersonic exhaust jet.', u'The speed increase of a rocket nozzle is mostly determined by its area expansion ratio\u2014the ratio of the area of the throat to the area at the exit, but detailed properties of the gas are also important.', u'Larger ratio nozzles are more massive but are able to extract more heat from the combustion gases, increasing the exhaust velocity.', u'=== Thrust vectoring ===\n\nVehicles typically require the overall thrust to change direction over the length of the burn.', u'A number of different ways to achieve this have been flown:\nThe entire engine is mounted on a hinge or gimbal and any propellant feeds reach the engine via low pressure flexible pipes or rotary couplings.', u'Just the combustion chamber and nozzle is gimballed, the pumps are fixed, and high pressure feeds attach to the engine.', u'Multiple engines (often canted at slight angles) are deployed but throttled to give the overall vector that is required, giving only a very small penalty.', u'High-temperature vanes protrude into the exhaust and can be tilted to deflect the jet.', u'== Overall performance ==\nRocket technology can combine very high thrust (meganewtons), very high exhaust speeds (around 10 times the speed of sound in air at sea level) and very high thrust/weight ratios (>100) simultaneously as well as being able to operate outside the atmosphere, and while permitting the use of low pressure and hence lightweight tanks and structure.', u'Rockets can be further optimised to even more extreme performance along one or more of these axes at the expense of the others.', u'=== Specific impulse ===\n\nThe most important metric for the efficiency of a rocket engine is impulse per unit of propellant, this is called specific impulse (usually written \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          I\n          \n            s\n            p\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle I_{sp}}\n  ).', u'This is either measured as a speed (the effective exhaust velocity \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          v\n          \n            e\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v_{e}}\n   in metres/second or ft/s) or as a time (seconds).', u'An engine that gives a large specific impulse is normally highly desirable.', u'The specific impulse that can be achieved is primarily a function of the propellant mix (and ultimately would limit the specific impulse), but practical limits on chamber pressures and the nozzle expansion ratios reduce the performance that can be achieved.', u"=== Net

altitude.', u'Maximum efficiency for a rocket engine is achieved by maximising the momentum contribution of the equation without incurring penalties from over expanding the exhaust.', u'This occurs

hybrid rockets, the propellant flow entering the chamber is controlled using valves, in solid rockets it is controlled by changing the area of propellant that is burning and this can be designed into the propellant grain (and hence cannot be controlled in real-time).', u'Rockets can usually be throttled down to an exit pressure of about one-third of ambient pressure (often limited by flow separation in nozzles) and up to a maximum limit determined only by the mechanical strength of the engine.', u'In practice, the degree to which rockets can be throttled varies greatly, but most rockets can be throttled by a factor of 2 without great difficulty; the typical limitation is combustion stability, as for example, injectors need a minimum pressure to avoid triggering damaging oscillations (chugging or combustion instabilities); but injectors can be optimised and tested for wider ranges.', u'For example, some more recent liquid-propellant engine designs that have been optimised for greater throttling capability can be throttled to as low as 18\u201320 percent of rated thrust.', u'Solid rockets can be throttled by using shaped grains that will vary their surface area over the course of the burn.', u'=== Energy efficiency ===\n\nRocket engine nozzles are surprisingly efficient heat engines for generating a high speed jet, as a consequence of the high combustion temperature and high compression ratio.', u'Rocket nozzles give an excellent approximation to adiabatic expansion which is a reversible process, and hence they give efficiencies which are very close to that of the Carnot cycle.', u'Given the temperatures reached, over 60% efficiency can be achieved with chemical rockets.', u'For a vehicle employing a rocket engine the energetic efficiency is very good if the vehicle speed approaches or somewhat exceeds the exhaust velocity (relative to launch); but at low speeds the energy efficiency goes to 0% at zero speed (as with all jet propulsion.)', u'See Rocket energy efficiency for more details.', u'=== Thrust-to-weight ratio ===\n\nRockets, of all the jet engines, indeed of essentially all engines, have the highest thrust to weight ratio.', u'This is especially true for liquid rocket engines.', u'This high performance is due to the small volume of pressure vessels that make up the engine\u2014the pumps, pipes and combustion chambers involved.', u'The lack of inlet duct and the use of dense liquid propellant allows the pressurisation system to be small and lightweight, whereas duct engines have to deal with air which has a density about one thousand times lower.', u'Rocket thrusts are vacuum thrusts unless otherwise noted\nOf the liquid propellants used, density is worst for liquid hydrogen.', u'Although this propellant is marvellous in many ways, it has a very low density, about one fourteenth that of water.', u'This makes the turbopumps and pipework larger and heavier, and this is reflected in the thrust-to-weight ratio of engines that use it (for example the SSME) compared to those that do not (NK-33).', u'== Cooling ==\nFor efficiency reasons, and because they physically can, rockets run with combustion temperatures that can reach ~3,500 K (~3,200 \xb0C or ~5,800 \xb0F).', u'Most other jet engines have gas turbines in the hot exhaust.', u'Due to their larger surface area, they are harder to cool and hence there is a need to run the combustion processes at much lower temperatures, losing efficiency.', u'In addition, duct engines use air as an oxidant, which contains 78% largely unreactive nitrogen, which dilutes the reaction and lowers the temperatures.', u'Rockets have none of these inherent disadvantages.', u'Therefore, temperatures used in rockets are very often far higher than the melting point of the nozzle and combustion chamber materials (~1,200 K for copper).', u'Two exceptions are graphite and tungsten, although both are subject to oxidation if not protected.', u'Indeed, many construction materials can make perfectly acceptable propellants in their own right.', u'It is important that these materials be prevented from combusting, melting or vaporising to the point of failure.', u'This is sometimes somewhat facetiously termed an "engine-rich exhaust".', u'Materials technology could potentially place an upper limit on the exhaust temperature of chemical rockets.', u'Alternatively, rockets may use more common construction materials such as aluminium, steel, nickel or copper alloys and employ cooling systems that prevent the construction material itself becoming too hot.', u'Regenerative cooling, where the propellant is passed through tubes around the combustion chamber or nozzle, and other techniques, such as curtain cooling or film cooling, are employed to give longer nozzle and chamber life.', u'These techniques ensure that a gaseous thermal boundary layer touching the material is kept below the temperature which would cause the material to catastrophically fail.', u'In rockets, the heat fluxes that can pass through the wall are among the highest in engineering; fluxes are generally in the range of 1-200 MW/m2.', u'The strongest heat fluxes are found at the throat, which often sees twice that found in the associated chamber and nozzle.', u'This is due to the combination of high speeds (which gives a very thin boundary layer), and although lower than the chamber, the high temperatures seen there.', u'(See rocket nozzles above for temperatures in nozzle).', u'In rockets the coolant methods include:\nuncooled (used for short runs mainly during testing)\nablative walls (walls are lined with a material that is continuously vaporised and carried away).', u'radiative cooling (the chamber becomes almost white hot and radiates the heat away)\ndump cooling (a propellant, usually hydrogen, is passed around the chamber and dumped)\nregenerative cooling (liquid rockets use the fuel, or occasionally the oxidiser, to cool the chamber via a cooling jacket before being injected)\ncurtain cooling (propellant injection is arranged so the temperature of the gases is cooler at the walls)\nfilm cooling (surfaces are wetted with liquid propellant, which cools as it evaporates)\nIn all cases the cooling effect that prevents the wall from being destroyed is caused by a thin layer of insulating fluid (a boundary layer) that is in contact with the walls that is far cooler than the combustion temperature.', u'Provided this boundary layer is intact the wall will not be damaged.', u'Disruption of the boundary layer may occur during cooling failures or combustion instabilities, and wall failure typically occurs soon after.', u'With regenerative cooling a second boundary layer is found in the coolant channels around the chamber.', u'This boundary layer thickness needs to be as small as possible, since the boundary layer acts as an insulator between the wall and the coolant.', u'This may be achieved by making the coolant velocity in the channels as high as possible.', u'In practice, regenerative cooling is nearly always used in conjunction with curtain cooling and/or film cooling.', u'Liquid-fuelled engines are often run fuel-rich, which lowers combustion temperatures.', u'This reduces heat loads on the engine and allows lower cost materials and a simplified cooling system.', u'This can also increase performance by lowering the average molecular weight of the exhaust and increasing the efficiency with which combustion heat is converted to kinetic exhaust energy.', u'== Mechanical issues ==\nRocket combustion chambers are normally operated at fairly high pressure, typically 10-200 bar (1 to 20 MPa, 150-3,000 psi).', u'When operated within significant atmospheric pressure, higher combustion chamber pressures give better performance by permitting a larger and more efficient nozzle to be fitted without it being grossly overexpanded.', u'However, these high pressures cause the outermost part of the chamber to be under very large hoop stresses \u2013 rocket engines are pressure vessels.', u'Worse, due to the high temperatures created in rocket engines the materials used tend to have a significantly lowered working tensile strength.', u'In addition, significant temperature gradients are set up in the walls of the chamber and nozzle, these cause differential expansion of the inner liner that create internal stresses.', u'== Acoustic issues ==\nThe extreme vibration and acoustic environment inside a rocket motor commonly result in peak stresses well above mean values, especially in the presence of organ pipe-like resonances and gas turbulence.', u'=== Combustion instabilities ===\nThe combustion may display undesired instabilities, of sudden or periodic nature.', u'The pressure in the injection chamber may increase until the propellant flow through the injector plate decreases; a moment later the pressure drops and the flow increases, injecting more propellant in the combustion chamber which burns a moment later, and again increases the chamber pressure, repeating the cycle.', u'This may lead to high-amplitude pressure oscillations, often in ultrasonic range, which may damage the motor.', u'Oscillations of \xb1200 psi at 25 kHz were the cause of failures of early versions of the Titan II missile second stage engines.', u'The other failure mode is a deflagration to detonation transition; the supersonic pressure wave formed in the combustion chamber may destroy the engine.', u'Combustion instability was also a problem during Atlas development.', u'The Rocketdyne engines used in the Atlas family were found to suffer from this effect in several static firing tests, and three missile launches exploded on the pad due to rough combustion in the booster engines.', u'In most cases, it occurred while attempting to start the engines with a "dry start" method whereby the igniter mechanism would be activated prior to propellant injection.', u'During the process of man-rating Atlas for Project Mercury, solving combustion instability was a high priority, and the final two Mercury flights sported an upgraded propulsion system with baffled injectors and a hypergolic igniter.', u'The problem affecting Atlas vehicles was mainly the so-called "racetrack" phenomenon, where burning propellant would swirl around in a circle at faster and faster speeds, eventually producing vibration strong enough to rupture the engine, leading to complete destruction of the rocket.', u'It was eventually solved by adding several baffles around the injector face to break up swirling propellant.', u'More significantly, combustion instability was a problem with the Saturn F-1 engines.', u'Some of the early units tested exploded during static firing, which led to the addition of injector baffles.', u'In the Soviet space program, combustion instability also proved a problem on some rocket engines, including the RD-107 engine used in the R-7 family and the RD-216 used in the R-14 family, and several failures of these vehicles occurred before the problem was solved.', u'Soviet engineering and manufacturing processes never satisfactorily resolved combustion instability in larger RP-1/LOX engines, so the RD-180 engine used to power the Zenit family still used four smaller thrust chambers fed by a common engine mechanism.', u'The combustion instabilities can be provoked by remains of cleaning solvents in the engine (e.g.', u'the first attempted launch of a Titan II in 1962), reflected shock wave, initial instability after ignition, explosion near the nozzle that reflects into the combustion chamber, and many more factors.', u'In stable engine designs the oscillations are quickly suppressed; in unstable designs they persist for prolonged periods.', u'Oscillation suppressors are commonly used.', u'Periodic variations of thrust, caused by combustion instability or longitudinal vibrations of structures between the tanks and the engines which modulate the propellant flow, are known as "pogo oscillations" or "pogo", named after the pogo stick.', u'Three different types of combustion instabilities occur:\nChugging\nThis is a low frequency oscillation at a few Hertz in chamber pressure usually caused by pressure variations in feed lines due to variations in acceleration of the vehicle.', u'This can cause cyclic variation in thrust, and the effects can vary from merely annoying to actually damaging the payload or vehicle.', u'Chugging can be minimised by using gas-filled damping tubes on feed lines of high density propellants.', u'Buzzing\nThis can be caused due to insufficient pressure drop across the injectors.', u'It generally is mostly annoying, rather than being damaging.', u'However, in extreme cases combustion can end up being forced backwards through the injectors \u2013 this can cause explosions with monopropellants.', u'Screeching\nThis is the most immediately damaging, and the hardest to control.', u'It is due to acoustics within the combustion chamber that often couples to the chemical combustion processes that are the primary drivers of the energy release, and can lead to unstable resonant "screeching" that commonly leads to catastrophic failure due to thinning of the insulating thermal boundary layer.', u'Acoustic oscillations can be excited by thermal processes, such as the flow of hot air through a pipe or combustion in a chamber.', u'Specifically, standing acoustic waves inside a chamber can be intensified if combustion occurs more intensely in regions where the pressure of the acoustic wave is maximal.', u'Such effects are very difficult to predict analytically during the design process, and have usually been addressed by expensive, time consuming and extensive testing, combined with trial and error remedial correction measures.', u'Screeching is often dealt with by detailed changes to injectors, or changes in the propellant chemistry, or vaporising the propellant before injection, or use of Helmholtz dampers within the combustion chambers to change the resonant modes of the chamber.', u"Testing for the possibility of screeching is sometimes done by exploding small explosive charges outside the combustion chamber with a tube set tangentially to the combustion chamber near the injectors to determine the engine's impulse response and then evaluating the time response of the chamber pressure- a fast recovery indicates a stable system.", u'=== Exhaust noise ===\n\nFor all but the very smallest sizes, rocket exhaust compared to other engines is generally very noisy.', u'As the hypersonic exhaust mixes with the ambient air, shock waves are formed.', u'The Space Shuttle generates over 200 dB(A) of noise around its base.', u'The sound intensity from the shock waves generated depends on the size of the rocket and on the exhaust velocity.', u'Such shock waves seem to account for the characteristic crackling and popping sounds produced by large rocket engines when heard live.', u'These noise peaks typically overload microphones and audio electronics, and so are generally weakened or entirely absent in recorded or broadcast audio reproductions.', u'For large rockets at close range, the acoustic effects could actually kill.', u'More worryingly for space agencies, such sound levels can also damage the launch structure, or worse, be reflected back at the comparatively delicate rocket above.', u'This is why so much water is typically used at launches.', u'The water spray changes the acoustic qualities of the air and reduces or deflects the sound energy away from the rocket.', u'Generally speaking, noise is most intense when a rocket is close to the ground, since the noise from the engines radiates up away from the jet, as well as reflecting off the ground.', u'Also, when the vehicle is moving slowly, little of the chemical energy input to the engine can go into increasing the kinetic energy of the rocket (since useful power P transmitted to the vehicle is \n  \n    \n      \n        P\n        =\n        F\n        \u2217\n        V\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P=F*V}\n   for thrust F and speed V).', u"Then the largest portion of the energy is dissipated in the exhaust's interaction with the ambient air, producing noise.", u'This noise can be reduced somewhat by flame trenches with roofs, by water injection around the jet and by deflecting the jet at an angle.', u'== Testing ==\nRocket engines are usually statically tested at a test facility before being put into production.', u'For high altitude engines, either a shorter nozzle must be used, or the rocket must be tested in a large vacuum chamber.', u'== Safety ==\nRockets have a reputation for unreliability and danger; especially catastrophic failures.', u'Contrary to this reputation, carefully designed rockets can be made arbitrarily reliable.', u'In military use, rockets are not unreliable.', u'However, one of the main non-military uses of rockets is for orbital launch.', u'In this application, the premium has typically been placed on minimum weight, and it is difficult to achieve high reliability and low weight simultaneously.', u'In addition, if the number of flights launched is low, there is a very high chance of a design, operations or manufacturing error causing destruction of the vehicle.', u'Essentially all launch vehicles are test vehicles by normal aerospace standards (as of 2006).', u'=== Saturn family (1961-1975) ===\nThe Rocketdyne H-1 engine, used in a cluster of eight in the first stage of the Saturn I and Saturn IB launch vehicles, had no catastrophic failures in 152 engine-flights.', u'The Pratt and Whitney RL10 engine, used in a cluster of six in the Saturn I second stage, had no catastrophic failures in 36 engine-flights.', u'The Rocketdyne F-1 engine, used in a cluster of five in the first stage of the Saturn V, had no failures in 65 engine-flights.', u'The Rocketdyne J-2 engine, used in a cluster of five in the Saturn V second stage, and singly in the Saturn IB second stage and Saturn V third stage, had no catastrophic failures in 86 engine-flights.', u'=== Space Shuttle (1981-2011) ===\nThe Space Shuttle Main Engine, used in a cluster of three, had no catastrophic in-flight failures in 405 engine-flights.', u'However, the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster, used in pairs, caused one notable catastrophic failure in 270 engine-flights.', u'== Chemistry ==\nRocket propellants require a high specific energy (energy per unit mass), because ideally all the reaction energy appears as kinetic energy of the exhaust gases, and exhaust velocity is the single most important performance parameter of an engine, on which vehicle performance depends.', u'Aside from inevitable losses and imperfections in the engine, incomplete combustion, etc., after specific reaction energy, the main theoretical limit reducing the exhaust velocity obtained is that, according to the laws of thermodynamics, a fraction of the chemical energy may go into rotation of the exhaust molecules, where it is unavailable for producing thrust.', u'Monatomic gases like helium have only three degrees of freedom, corresponding to the three dimensions of space, {x,y,z}, and only such spherically symmetric molecules escape this kind of loss.', u'A diatomic molecule like H2 can rotate about either of the two axes perpendicular to the one joining the two atoms, and as the equipartition law of statistical mechanics demands that the available thermal energy be divided equally among the degrees of freedom, for such a gas in thermal equilibrium 3/5 of the energy can go into unidirectional motion, and 2/5 into rotation (actually, the vibration of the molecule should not be neglected, see gas heat capacity).', u'A triatomic molecule like water has six degrees of freedom, so the energy is divided equally among rotational and translational degrees of freedom.', u'For most chemical reactions the latter situation is the case.', u'This issue is traditionally described in terms of the ratio, gamma, of the specific heat of the gas at constant volume to that at constant pressure.', u'The rotational energy loss is largely recovered in practice if the expansion nozzle is large enough to allow the gases to expand and cool sufficiently, the function of the nozzle being to convert the random thermal motions of the molecules in the combustion chamber into the unidirectional translation that produces thrust.', u'As long as the exhaust gas remains in equilibrium as it expands, the initial rotational energy will be largely returned to translation in the nozzle.', u'Although the specific reaction energy per unit mass of reactants is key, low mean molecular weight in the reaction products is also important in practice in determining exhaust velocity.', u'This is because the high gas temperatures in rocket engines pose serious problems for the engineering of survivable motors.', u'Because temperature is proportional to the mean energy per molecule, a given amount of energy distributed among more molecules of lower mass permits a higher exhaust velocity at a given temperature.', u'This means low atomic mass elements are favoured.', u'Liquid hydrogen (LH2) and oxygen (LOX, or LO2), are the most effective propellants in terms of exhaust velocity that have been widely used to date, though a few exotic combinations involving boron or liquid ozone are potentially somewhat better in theory if various practical problems could be solved.', u'It is important to note in computing the specific reaction energy, that the entire mass of the propellants, including both fuel and oxidiser, must be included.', u'The fact that air-breathing engines are typically able to obtain oxygen "for free" without having to carry it along, accounts for one factor of why air-breathing engines are very much more propellant-mass efficient, and one reason that rocket engines are far less suitable for most ordinary terrestrial applications.', u'Fuels for car or turbojet engines, use atmospheric oxygen and so have a much better effective energy output per unit mass of propellant that must be carried, but are similar per unit mass of fuel.', u'Computer programs that predict the performance of propellants in rocket engines are available.', u'== Ignition ==\n\nWith liquid and hybrid rockets, immediate ignition of the propellant(s) as they first enter the combustion chamber is essential.', u'With liquid propellants (but not gaseous), failure to ignite within milliseconds usually causes too much liquid propellant to be inside the chamber, and if/when ignition occurs the amount of hot gas created can exceed the maximum design pressure of the chamber, causing a catastrophic failure of the pressure vessel.', u'This is sometimes called a hard start or a rapid unscheduled disassembly (RUD).', u'Ignition can be achieved by a number of different methods; a pyrotechnic charge can be used, a plasma torch can be used, or electric spark ignition may be employed.', u'Some fuel/oxidiser combinations ignite on contact (hypergolic), and non-hypergolic fuels can be "chemically ignited" by priming the fuel lines with hypergolic propellants (popular in Russian engines).', u'Gaseous propellants generally will not cause hard starts, with rockets the total injector area is less than the throat thus the chamber pressure tends to ambient prior to ignition and high pressures cannot form even if the entire chamber is full of flammable gas at ignition.', u'Solid propellants are usually ignited with one-shot pyrotechnic devices.', u'Once ignited, rocket chambers are self-sustaining and igniters are not needed.', u'Indeed, chambers often spontaneously reignite if they are restarted after being shut down for a few seconds.', u'However, when cooled, many rockets cannot be restarted without at least minor maintenance, such as replacement of the pyrotechnic igniter.', u'== Jet physics ==\n\nRocket jets vary depending on the rocket engine, design altitude, altitude, thrust and other factors.', u'Carbon rich exhausts from kerosene fuels are often orange in colour due to the black body radiation of the unburnt particles, in addition to the blue Swan bands.', u'Peroxide oxidizer-based rockets and hydrogen rocket jets contain largely steam and are nearly invisible to the naked eye but shine brightly in the ultraviolet and infrared.', u'Jets from solid rockets can be highly visible as the propellant frequently contains metals such as elemental aluminium which burns with an orange-white flame and adds energy to the combustion process.', u'Some exhausts, notably alcohol fuelled rockets, can show visible shock diamonds.', u"These are due to cyclic variations in the jet pressure relative to ambient creating shock waves that form 'Mach disks'.", u'The shape of the jet varies from the design altitude, at high altitude all rockets are grossly under-expanded, and a quite small percentage of exhaust gases actually end up expanding forwards.', u'== Types of rocket engines ==\n\n\n=== Physically powered ===\n\n\n=== Chemically powered ===\n\n\n=== Electrically powered ===\n\n\n=== Thermal ===\n\n\n==== Preheated ====\n\n\n==== Solar thermal ====\nThe Solar thermal rocket would make use of solar power to directly heat reaction mass, and therefore does not require an electrical generator as most other forms of solar-powered propulsion do.', u'A solar thermal rocket only has to carry the means of capturing solar energy, such as concentrators and mirrors.', u'The heated propellant is fed through a conventional rocket nozzle to produce thrust.', u'The engine thrust is directly related to the surface area of the solar collector and to the local intensity of the solar radiation and inversely proportional to the Isp.', u'==== Beamed thermal ====\n\n\n==== Nuclear thermal ====\n\n\n=== Nuclear ===\nNuclear propulsion includes a wide variety of propulsion methods that use some form of nuclear reaction as their primary power source.', u'Various types of nuclear propulsion have been proposed, and some of them tested, for spacecraft applications:\n\n\n== History of rocket engines ==\nAccording to the writings of the Roman Aulus Gellius, in c. 400 BC, a Greek Pythagorean named Archytas, propelled a wooden bird along wires using steam.', u'However, it would not appear to have been powerful enough to take off under its own thrust.', u"The aeolipile described in the first century BC (often known as Hero's engine) essentially consists of a steam rocket on a bearing.", u'It was created almost two millennia before the Industrial Revolution but the principles behind it were not well understood, and its full potential was not realised for a millennium.', u'The availability of black powder to propel projectiles was a precursor to the development of the first solid rocket.', u'Ninth Century Chinese Taoist alchemists discovered black powder in a search for the elixir of life; this accidental discovery led to fire arrows which were the first rocket engines to leave the ground.', u'It is stated that "the reactive forces of incendiaries were probably not applied to the propulsion of projectiles prior to the 13th century".', u'A turning point in rocket technology emerged with a short manuscript entitled Liber Ignium ad Comburendos Hostes (abbreviated as The Book of Fires).', u'The manuscript is composed of recipes for creating incendiary weapons from the mid-eighth to the end of the thirteenth centuries\u2014two of which are rockets.', u'The first recipe calls for one part of colophonium and sulfur added to six parts of saltpeter (potassium nitrate) dissolved in laurel oil, then inserted into hollow wood and lit to "fly away suddenly to whatever place you wish and burn up everything".', u'The second recipe combines one pound of sulfur, two pounds of charcoal, and six pounds of saltpeter\u2014all finely powdered on a marble slab.', u'This powder mixture is packed firmly into a long and narrow case.', u'The introduction of saltpeter into pyrotechnic mixtures connected the shift from hurled Greek fire into self-propelled rocketry.', u'.', u'Articles and books on the subject of rocketry appeared increasingly from the fifteenth through seventeenth centuries.', u'In the sixteenth century, German military engineer Conrad Haas (1509-1576) wrote a manuscript which introduced the construction to multi-staged rockets.', u'Rocket engines were also brought in use by Tippu Sultan, the king of Mysore.', u'These rockets could be of various sizes, but usually consisted of a tube of soft hammered iron about 8 in (20 cm) long and 1 1\u20442\u20133 in (3.8\u20137.6 cm) diameter, closed at one end and strapped to a shaft of bamboo about 4 ft (120 cm) long.', u'The iron tube acted as a combustion chamber and contained well packed black powder propellant.', u'A rocket carrying about one pound of powder could travel almost 1,000 yards (910 m).', u"These 'rockets', fitted with swords used to travel long distance, several meters above in air before coming down with swords edges facing the enemy.", u'These rockets were used against British empire very effectively.', u'Slow development of this technology continued up to the later 19th century, when Russian Konstantin Tsiolkovsky first wrote about liquid-fueled rocket engines.', u'He was the first to develop the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, though it was not published widely for some years.', u'The modern solid- and liquid-fueled engines became realities early in the 20th century, thanks to the American physicist Robert Goddard.', u'Goddard was the first to use a De Laval nozzle on a solid-propellant (gunpowder) rocket engine, doubling the thrust and increasing the efficiency by a factor of about twenty-five.', u'This was the birth of the modern rocket engine.', u'He calculated from his independently-derived rocket equation that a reasonably sized rocket, using solid fuel, could place a one-pound payload on the Moon.', u'He began to use liquid propellants in 1921 and was the first to launch, in 1926, a liquid-propellant rocket.', u'Goddard pioneered the use of the De Laval nozzle, lightweight propellant tanks, thrust vectoring, the smoothly-throttled liquid fuel engine, regenerative cooling, and curtain cooling.', u'During the late 1930s, German scientists, such

{'sentences': [u'Alfred Manuel "Billy" Martin (May 16, 1928 \u2013 December 25, 1989) was an American Major League Baseball second baseman and manager.', u'He is best known as the manager of the New York Yankees, a position he held five different times.', u'As Yankees manager, he led the team to consecutive American League pennants in 1976 and 1977; the Yankees were swept in the 1976 World Series by the Cincinnati Reds but triumphed over the Los Angeles Dodgers in six games in the 1977 World Series.', u'He also had notable managerial tenures with several other AL squads, leading four of them to division championships.', u'Martin had a distinguished playing career in the 1950s, highlighted by his years with the Yankees during which he performed at a high level in appearances in the World Series.', u'He was also selected for the American League All Star team in 1956.', u'In these years his infamous propensity for fisticuffs became established, both on and off the baseball field.', u'As a manager, Martin was known for turning losing teams into winners, and for arguing animatedly with umpires, including a widely parodied routine in which he kicked dust on their feet.', u'However, he was criticized for not getting along with veteran players and owners, burning out young pitchers, and for having an addiction to alcohol.', u'During the 1969 through 1988 period as a manager, Martin totaled 1,253 victories with a .553 winning percentage.', u'== Early life ==\nMartin was born Alfred Manuel Pesano, Jr. to Alfred Manuel Pesano, Sr. and Joan Salvini "Jenny" Pesano in Berkeley, California.', u'He was of Portuguese and Italian descent, as his father was a native of the Azores and his mother was born to a large Italian family in California.', u'Alfred, Sr. abandoned the family eight months later; for this reason, Jenny always referred to Alfred, her second husband, as the "jackass."', u"(She had been married before to a native Italian named Donato Pisani, whom her family arranged her to marry, and later married a singer named Jack Downey and took his name; the marriage lasted until Jack's death many years later.)", u'Eventually, Jenny changed the family name to "Martin."', u'He began being called "Billy" after his grandmother (Joan\'s mother) started calling him "Bello" (Italian masculine for "beautiful"; Martin said in his autobiography Number One that she would also call him "Bellitz,", a dialectical version of the same word).', u'As Martin grew up in West Berkeley his mother took careful notice not to let her son know his actual name, not wanting him to know he shared the same name with Alfred Pesano.', u'In fact, such careful care had been taken to hide Martin\'s birthname from him that he didn\'t find out until entering junior high; on his first day in Seventh Grade, while the teacher took attendance, his teacher called on "Alfred Martin" and young Billy thought she had skipped over him.', u"== Playing career ==\nWhile attending Berkeley High School, Martin tried out for and began playing for the Oakland Junior Oaks, affiliated with the Pacific Coast League's Oakland Oaks club.", u'After graduation in 1946, he was signed by Eddie Leishman, also a Berkeley native, to play for him for Idaho Falls the Class D Pioneer League, hitting .254 in 32 games.', u'Late in the 1947 season, he was signed to the Oaks, where his manager was Casey Stengel, who admired his aggressive play.', u'Martin played for the Oaks in 1948 and 1949.', u'When Stengel became the manager of the New York Yankees in 1949 he had the Yankees obtain Martin in 1950.', u'That year, Martin batted .250 in 34 games.', u'Martin began his major league career in 1950 as a second baseman for the Yankees.', u'As a player, he was known for making clutch plays.', u'In the 1952 World Series, he made a game-saving catch on an infield popup in Game 7.', u'In the 1953 season, Martin had career highs in home runs (15), RBIs (75), doubles (24), triples (6), and times hit by pitch (6).', u'He was the most valuable player of the 1953 World Series, as he batted .500 with a .958 slugging percentage and delivered with an RBI in Game 6 to clinch the series.', u'Martin was an All-Star in 1956.', u'In 1958, Martin led the league in sacrifice hits, with 13.', u"After his 1957 trade (which also included Ralph Terry, Woodie Held, and Bob Martyn) to the Kansas City Athletics (see Altercations below), Martin's career declined, with several short stints with six different teams over the final 4\xbd seasons of his playing career: the Athletics, the Detroit Tigers, the Cleveland Indians, the Cincinnati Reds, the Milwaukee Braves and the Minnesota Twins.", u'Martin retired in 1961 with a career batting average of .257.', u'He hit .333 in 28 World Series games for the Yankees.', u"=== Altercations ===\n\nDespite Martin's impressive work ethic in practice and at the game, he developed a reputation for post-game drinking escapades and occasional allegations of being involved in fights.", u'While Martin was by all accounts a very accomplished fighter who would quickly dispatch most any opponent in a brawl, most of the incidents that received significantly media play were of questionable accuracy.', u'The famous Copacabana nightclub altercation involving Martin, Hank Bauer, Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra resulted in Martin being traded from the Yankees to the Kansas City Athletics, but the Bauer family later said it had been Hank Bauer, not Billy Martin who has actually thrown punches.', u'Being told of the trade, Martin felt betrayed by Stengel, with whom he had a strong father-son relationship, for failing to prevent the trade, and the two did not speak for years.', u'Martin did have several on the field fights of note.', u'On August 4, 1960, Martin, then playing for the Reds, charged the mound in the second inning after receiving a brushback pitch from Chicago Cubs pitcher Jim Brewer.', u'Martin threw his bat at Brewer, who picked up the bat and started to hand it to Martin as he approached.', u'Martin punched Brewer in the right eye, breaking his cheekbone.', u'Brewer was hospitalized for two months, and Martin served a five-day suspension.', u"The Cubs sued Martin for $1,000,000 (equivalent to $8,000,000 in 2015), for the loss of Brewer's services.", u'While the Cubs dropped their case, Brewer pursued his, and in 1969, a judge ordered Martin to pay $10,000 (equivalent to $60,000 in 2015), in damages.', u'When informed of the judgment by the press, he asked sarcastically, "How do they want it?', u'Cash or check?"', u"Martin's fights as a player also included bouts with Jimmy Piersall, Clint Courtney (twice), Matt Batts and Tommy Lasorda.", u'== Managing career ==\n\n\n=== Minnesota Twins ===\nMartin spent eight years (1962\u201369) in the Minnesota organization after his retirement.', u'He was a scout from 1962\u201364, the third-base coach of the Twins from 1965 through May 27, 1968, and manager of their Triple-A affiliate, the Denver Bears, for the last half of the 1968 campaign.', u"He succeeded Cal Ermer as Minnesota's big-league manager following the '68 season.", u"The Twins won the 1969 American League West title (both leagues now had two divisions after expanding from 10 teams to 12) in Martin's only season as their manager.", u'However, they were swept by the Baltimore Orioles in the first ever American League Championship Series.', u'Martin was fired after the season following an August 1969 fight in Detroit with one of his pitchers, 20-game winner Dave Boswell, and outfielder Bob Allison in an alley outside the legendary Lindell A.C. bar.', u'After knocking out Allison with one punch, Boswell was in turn knocked out by Martin; the pitcher received a cut that required 20 stitches.', u'Martin spent the 1970 season out of baseball.', u'=== Detroit Tigers ===\nMartin managed the Detroit Tigers from 1971 to 1973.', u'He guided the team to a first-place finish in 1972.', u'During the 1972 American League Championship Series, Oakland Athletics shortstop Bert Campaneris threw his bat at Detroit pitcher Lerrin LaGrow after being hit by a pitch.', u'In the ensuing brawl, an infuriated Martin had to be restrained by umpires and teammates to prevent him from going after Campaneris.', u'The Tigers lost the series three games to two, the first year that the ALCS went the full five games (It was the first such year for the NLCS as well.)', u'While posing for a baseball card as the manager for the Detroit Tigers in 1972, Martin gave photographers the middle finger.', u"The gesture went unnoticed until after the card's release.", u'Martin also played a key role in the discovery of Ron LeFlore in a Michigan state prison.', u'Martin was lured to Michigan State Prison by another inmate who knew Martin.', u"The unorthodox Martin witnessed LeFlore's speed and strength.", u'Martin helped LeFlore get permission for day-parole and a tryout at Tiger Stadium.', u'In the summer of 1973, the Tigers signed him to a contract, which enabled LeFlore to meet the conditions for parole.', u'Later that year, Martin brazenly told the press that he had ordered his pitchers to throw spitballs and shine balls, reportedly because Gaylord Perry was frequently throwing spitballs when the Tigers faced him.', u'American League president Joe Cronin suspended him for three days, but just as he was due to come off the suspension, the Tigers fired him.', u"=== Texas Rangers ===\nMartin's next managerial job was with the Texas Rangers, where he took the club from last place to second place in 1974, but was fired in 1975.", u'He was hired by owner Bob Short replacing Whitey Herzog at the end of the 1973 season.', u'He surprised the baseball world in 1974 by helping the Rangers to an 84-76 record after they had two consecutive 100+ loss seasons.', u"But after the 1975 team went 44-51 under Martin, and after a confrontation with new Rangers owner Brad Corbett, Martin was fired on July 20 and Frank Lucchesi, one of Martin's coaches and a man who Martin thought was undermining him to Corbett so he could take the managerial position himself, was named as his replacement.", u'=== First stint with the Yankees ===\n\nMartin was not out of work for very long, as the Yankees had also fired their manager, Bill Virdon.', u"The former Yankee second baseman was hired to take his place, marking Martin's first time in a Yankee uniform since the 1957 trade.", u'With Martin at the helm, the Yankees went 30-26 in their final 56 games of the 1975 season; he then managed them to the World Series in 1976 (their first pennant since 1964) and 1977, winning in 1977.', u'He feuded publicly with both Yankee owner George Steinbrenner and star outfielder Reggie Jackson.', u'In one especially infamous incident, on June 18, 1977, in the middle game of what would prove to be a three-game series sweep by the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, Martin pulled Jackson off the field (replacing him with Paul Blair) in mid-inning for failing to hustle and catch a shallow outfield fly ball by Jim Rice, allowing Rice to reach second base.', u'The extremely angry and highly animated Martin had to be restrained by coaches Elston Howard and Yogi Berra from getting into a fight with Jackson in the dugout during the nationally-televised Saturday afternoon game.', u'In 1978, Martin had another major incident with Jackson and it eventually led to him losing his position.', u'On July 17 against the Kansas City Royals, Jackson came to the plate in the bottom of the tenth inning with Thurman Munson on base and Martin put the bunt sign on.', u'After Jackson fouled the first pitch off, the sign was taken off and Jackson was given the sign to swing away.', u'Jackson bunted again, and then on the third pitch he bunted again and popped out.', u'A furious Martin demanded Jackson be suspended for the remainder of the season after the game, but after conversing with upper management Martin agreed on a five-game suspension.', u'Then, when Jackson returned, he told reporters that he did not know why Martin had suspended him.', u"To make matters worse for Martin, he was accused of racism for demanding Jackson's suspension after word leaked to the press that Sparky Lyle, who was going through his own issues with team management, violated team rules that same day when he left the stadium and went home without permission after refusing to pitch a second full inning, yet received no punishment.", u'Then he learned that Steinbrenner was looking to trade his manager to the Chicago White Sox, and in return would receive White Sox manager Bob Lemon.', u'Martin finally had enough, and following the July 23 game in Chicago Martin lashed out at his star player and his owner.', u'Martin told reporters in Chicago, "They deserve each other.', u'One\'s a born liar [Jackson], and the other\'s convicted [Steinbrenner]."', u"(Martin was referring to Steinbrenner's conviction for making illegal donations to Richard Nixon's 1972 election campaign, a conviction that resulted in Steinbrenner being suspended from baseball for 15 months).", u'The next day, having thought over the impact of his words Martin resigned in a tearful press conference in Kansas City (it was said, including by Martin in his 1980 autobiography, that Steinbrenner had sent Al Rosen, who was the team president at the time, to fire Martin at the hotel but Martin resigned before he could).', u'Steinbrenner replaced Martin with Lemon, who had lost his job with the White Sox approximately a month earlier despite winning AL Manager of the Year in 1977.', u"Soon afterward, at the annual Old-Timers' Game at Yankee Stadium, in a grandstanding gesture and an overwhelming demand by the fans, the Yankees had public address announcer Bob Sheppard introduce an unemployed Martin as the Yankees' next manager for the 1980 season (with Lemon moving to the front office).", u'Steinbrenner and Martin had apparently patched up their differences, but Lemon managed the team for 1978\u20131979.', u'=== Second stint with the Yankees ===\n\nIn 1979, the Yankees got off to a slow start under Lemon.', u'Injuries to Reggie Jackson and Goose Gossage as well as the death of Thurman Munson mid-season had the Yankees reeling.', u'Steinbrenner fired Lemon and brought back Martin earlier than previously planned.', u'The Yankees failed to improve, however, and their streak of American League East division titles ended at three.', u'After the 1979 season, Martin got into a fight with marshmallow salesman Joseph Cooper at a hotel in Minneapolis.', u'According to Cooper, the fight started over a dispute on who should be "Manager of the Year", with Cooper saying Dick Williams or Earl Weaver.', u'Martin reportedly egged Cooper on, offering a $500 bet and later sucker punching Cooper when he agreed.', u'Steinbrenner fired him after that and replaced him with Dick Howser for the 1980 season.', u'=== Oakland Athletics ===\nMartin, an East Bay native born and raised in Berkeley, resurfaced with the Oakland Athletics, where he perfected a style of play that became known as "Billyball" (characterized as featuring aggressive base running).', u"Martin won the American League West Division title in the split season of 1981, swept the Kansas City Royals in the special division series (due to a players' strike), and then met the Yankees in the 1981 ALCS where his A's were swept by the Yankees.", u"Martin's early success with the A's led to his designation as the club's general manager\u2014giving him control over the baseball operations of the entire Oakland organization in 1981.", u"Martin was fired from both positions when the 1982 Athletics plummeted to a 68-94 record, largely because he'd overworked many of the pitchers from the 1981 team.", u'Years later, Rob Neyer estimated that the four top starters from the 1981 team threw anywhere from 120-140 pitches per complete game\u2014a heavy workload for pitchers as young as the members of the 1981 staff were.', u'=== Remaining stints with the Yankees ===\nMartin returned to the New York Yankees in 1983, 1985, and 1988, but never for more than one full season.', u'During his years as a major league manager, Art Fowler usually served as his pitching coach.', u'Each time, while his teams managed to make good accounts of themselves on the field, he was fired due to his behavior on and off the field.', u'During the 1983 season, Martin was involved in one of the most controversial regular season games, known as the Pine Tar Incident, where umpires nullified a go-ahead home run by Yankee nemesis, Kansas City Royals third baseman George Brett, when Martin protested that there was too much pine tar on his bat.', u"Ultimately, American League President Lee MacPhail ruled in favor of the Royals' protest, reinstating the home run, and replaying the game from the point of the nullification.", u'At the start of the replayed game, Martin tried to protest on the grounds that Brett had missed a base.', u'The umpires working this game, however, had anticipated this, and had obtained an affidavit from the crew who had worked the original game saying that Brett had indeed touched all the bases.', u'On September 22, 1985, while at a hotel bar in Baltimore, Maryland, Martin fought one of his pitchers, Ed Whitson, who was 4 inches (100 mm) taller and 40 pounds (18 kg) heavier.', u'Martin suffered a broken arm, bruises, and cuts, while Whitson had a broken rib and a split lip.', u'He was fired after the 1985 season.', u'At the time of his death, Martin was preparing to manage the Yankees a sixth time for the 1990 season, to the point of having assembled a coaching staff.', u"=== Managerial record ===\n\n\n== Honors ==\n\nOn August 10, 1986, the Yankees retired Martin's uniform number 1 and dedicated a plaque in his honor for Monument Park at Yankee Stadium.", u'The plaque contains the words, There has never been a greater competitor than Billy.', u'Martin told the crowd, "I may not have been the greatest Yankee to put on the uniform, but I am the proudest."', u'The baseball fields at Bushrod Park in Oakland California are named for baseball player and manager Billy Martin\nMartin appeared on the 2011 Baseball Hall of Fame ballot.', u'He did not receive enough votes for induction.', u"Many of his contemporaries have remarked on Martin's ability to surprise the opposition and his outside-the-box thinking.", u'Commenting on Martin\'s strategy as a manager, Dave Winfield has stated that opposing players would often ask each other, "What\'s Billy doing now?"', u'George Steinbrenner has stated that when Martin was in his best form, he was a "baseball genius."', u'He has also been cited as an influence to other prominent managers, including Lou Piniella.', u'Martin both preceded and succeeded Piniella as Yankees manager.', u'== In popular culture ==\nIn 1978, Martin played himself in the CBS TV movie One in a Million: The Ron LeFlore Story.', u'On the comedy show Bizarre, Martin laid into Super Dave Osborne (albeit behind Martin\'s closed manager\'s office door at the Oakland Coliseum) after Osborne prodded him with insults such as "Your Billy Ball stinks" and "You\'re a stupid little Greek".', u'Osborne then amended the latter to "stupid Italian", which caused Martin to thrash the stuntman some more.', u"Martin was a guest celebrity ring announcer at the inaugural WrestleMania in March 1985, during his time as the manager of the Yankees, where he was referred to as 'New York's Number One'.", u'The crowd gave him a standing ovation.', u'Martin was the first baseball celebrity to appear at WrestleMania.', u'On May 24, 1986, on the season finale of Saturday Night Live, co-host Martin was "fired" by executive producer Lorne Michaels for being "drunk" in a skit, slurring his lines.', u'During the goodnights, Martin set the dressing room on fire in retaliation, a staged scene set as a cliffhanger for the following season.', u'In 1988, on Saturday Night Live\'s "Weekend Update", comedian Dennis Miller opened the sports with, "In Calgary tonight, Katarina Witt won the gold medal in figure skating, prompting Yankees owner George Steinbrenner to fire manager Billy Martin", as part of a continuous running gag on the segment where a recent sporting event "forces" Steinbrenner to fire whomever is managing the team in retaliation.', u'Martin was played by John Turturro in the 2007 ESPN mini-series The Bronx is Burning, which follows the tumultuous summer of 1977 in New York City.', u'== Personal life ==\nMartin was married four times and had two children, a daughter named Kelly Ann and a son named Billy Joe.', u'His first marriage was to Lois Berndt, by whom he had his daughter.', u'She divorced him in 1955, after he had contested the action for more than a year on the grounds that he was Catholic.', u'He married Gretchen Winkler in 1961, by whom he had his son, and stayed married to her until 1979, when the two divorced.', u'He was married a third time, to Heather Ervolino, while he was managing in Oakland, but was never faithful to his third wife and eventually married his mistress, a woman named Jillian Guiver, in January 1988.', u'In 1978, Martin and sports agent Doug Newton opened "Billy Martin\'s", a western wear boutique.', u'Newton bought out Martin in 1982, and the store remained open until 2010.', u'== Death ==\n\nMartin was working as a special consultant to George Steinbrenner when he was killed in a low speed, single vehicle collision during an ice storm at the end of the driveway to his farm in Port Crane, north of Binghamton, New York, on Christmas Day 1989.', u'He was pronounced dead at a hospital in Johnson City, New York, where efforts to revive him were unsuccessful.', u"Martin was eulogized by Cardinal John O'Connor at St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York, before

Fritz heard Oswald's name, he recognized it as that of the Book Depository employee who was reported missing and was already a suspect in the assassination.", u'Oswald was formally arraigned for the murder of Officer Tippit at 7:10 p.m., and by the end of the night (shortly after 1:30 a.m.) he had been arraigned for the assassination of President Kennedy as well.', u'Soon after his capture, Oswald encountered reporters in a hallway.', u'Oswald declared, "I didn\'t shoot anybody" and, "They\'ve taken me in because of the fact that I lived in the Soviet Union.', u'I\'m just a patsy!"', u'Later, at an arranged press meeting, a reporter asked, "Did you kill the President?"', u'and Oswald\u2014who by that time had been advised of the charge of murdering Tippit, but had not yet been arraigned in Kennedy\'s death\u2014answered, "No, I have not been charged with that.', u'In fact, nobody has said that to me yet.', u'The first thing I heard about it was when the newspaper reporters in the hall asked me that question."', u'As he was led from the room the question was called out, "What did you do in Russia?"', u'and, "How did you hurt your eye?', u'"; Oswald answered, "A policeman hit me."', u'== Police interrogation ==\n\nOswald was interrogated several times during his two days at Dallas Police Headquarters.', u'He admitted that he went to his rooming house after leaving the book depository.', u'He also admitted that he changed his clothes and armed himself with a .38 revolver before leaving his house to go to the theater.', u'However, Oswald denied killing Kennedy and Tippit, denied owning a rifle, and said two photographs of him holding a rifle and a pistol were fakes.', u'He denied telling his co-worker he wanted a ride to Irving to get curtain rods for his apartment (he said that the package contained his lunch).', u'He also denied carrying a long, bulky package to work the morning of the assassination.', u'Oswald denied knowing an "A. J. Hidell".', u'Oswald was then shown a forged Selective Service System card bearing his photograph and the alias, "Alek James Hidell" that he had in his possession at the time of his arrest.', u'Oswald refused to answer any questions concerning the card, saying "you have the card yourself and you know as much about it as I do."', u'The first interrogation of Oswald was conducted by FBI Special Agent James P. Hosty and Dallas Police Captain Will Fritz (chief of homicide) on Friday, November 22.', u'Asked to account for himself at the time of the assassination, Oswald replied that he was eating his lunch in the first floor lounge (known as the "domino room").', u'He said that he then went to the second-floor lunchroom to buy a Coca-Cola from the soda machine there and was drinking it when he encountered Dallas motorcycle policeman Marrion L. Baker, who had entered the building with his gun drawn.', u'Oswald said that while he was in the domino room, he saw two "Negro employees" walking by, one he recognized as "Junior" and a shorter man whose name he could not recall.', u'Junior Jarman and Harold Norman confirmed to the Warren Commission that they had "walked through" the domino room around noon during their lunch break.', u'When asked if anyone else was in the domino room, Norman testified that somebody else was there, but he could not remember who it was.', u'Jarman testified that Oswald was not in the domino room when he was there.', u'During one of the interrogation sessions, Deputy-sheriff Roger D. Craig entered the room and noticed that the suspect had openly confessed before his interrogators that he had left the Texas School Book Depository building around the time of the shooting, and when Capt.', u'Will Fritz tried to imply wrongdoing at Oswald\u2019s sudden departure from the building, saying to him: \u201cThis man (i.e.', u'deputy Craig) saw you leave,\u201d Oswald quickly retorted with no sense of guilt, \u201cI told you people I did.\u201d Meaning, there was nothing to conceal, in Oswald\u2019s view, at his departure from the building.', u'When Oswald was asked about the car he had gotten into, he replied: \u201cThat station wagon belongs to Mrs. Paine.', u"Don't try to drag her into this.\u201d At one point in the investigation, according to Craig, Oswald said in utter dismay, \u201cEverybody will know who I am now.\u201d The Warren Commission report, however, made it appear as though it was said in a dramatic tone, writing instead: \u201cNOW everybody will know who I am,\u201d transposing the now.", u'According to Craig, the real intonation was that of someone who had heretofore tried to conceal his identity as Deputy and that now it would be known to all; his reaction was that of dismay and disappointment at being exposed.', u'During his last interrogation on November 24, according to postal inspector Harry Holmes, Oswald was again asked where he was at the time of the shooting.', u'Holmes (who attended the interrogation at the invitation of Captain Will Fritz) said that Oswald replied that he was working on an upper floor when the shooting occurred, then went downstairs where he encountered Dallas motorcycle policeman Marrion L. Baker.', u'Oswald asked for legal representation several times while being interrogated, as well as in encounters with reporters.', u'But when H. Louis Nichols, President of the Dallas Bar Association met with him in his cell on Saturday, he declined their services, saying he wanted to be represented by John Abt, chief counsel to the Communist Party USA, or by lawyers associated with the American Civil Liberties Union.', u'Both Oswald and Ruth Paine tried to reach Abt by telephone several times Saturday and Sunday, but Abt was away for the weekend.', u"Oswald also declined his brother Robert's offer on Saturday to obtain a local attorney.", u'During an interrogation with Captain Fritz, when asked, "Are you a communist?', u'", he replied, "No, I am not a communist.', u'I am a Marxist."', u'== Death ==\n\nOn Sunday, November 24, Oswald was being led through the basement of Dallas Police Headquarters toward an armored car that was to take him to the nearby county jail.', u'At 11:21 a.m. CST, Dallas nightclub operator Jack Ruby stepped from the crowd and shot Oswald in the abdomen.', u"Oswald was taken unconscious by ambulance to Parkland Memorial Hospital\u2014the same hospital where doctors tried to save President Kennedy's life two days earlier.", u"Oswald died at 1:07 p.m. Oswald's death was announced on a TV news broadcast by Dallas police chief Jesse Curry.", u'An autopsy on Oswald was performed in the Office of the County Medical Examiner at 2:45 p.m. the same day.', u'Announcing the results of the gross autopsy, Dallas County medical examiner Earl Rose said: "The two things that we could determine were, first, that he died from a hemorrhage from a gunshot wound, and that otherwise he was a physically healthy male."', u"Rose's examination found that Ruby's bullet entered Oswald's left side in the front part of the abdomen and caused damage to his spleen, stomach, aorta, vena cava, kidney, liver, diaphragm, and eleventh rib before coming to rest on his right side.", u'A network television pool camera, there to cover the transfer, was broadcasting live; millions watching on NBC witnessed the shooting as it happened and on other networks within minutes afterward.', u'In 1964, Robert H. Jackson of the Dallas Times Herald was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Photography for his photograph of the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald by Jack Ruby.', u'=== Ruby\'s motive ===\nRuby later said he had been distraught over Kennedy\'s death and that his motive for killing Oswald was "saving Mrs. Kennedy the discomfiture of coming back to trial."', u'Others have hypothesized that Ruby was part of a conspiracy.', u'G. Robert Blakey, chief counsel for the House Select Committee on Assassinations from 1977 to 1979, said: "The most plausible explanation for the murder of Oswald by Jack Ruby was that Ruby had stalked him on behalf of organized crime, trying to reach him on at least three occasions in the forty-eight hours before he silenced him forever."', u'=== Burial ===\n\nOswald was buried on November 25 in Shannon Rose Hill Memorial Burial Park in Fort Worth.', u'Reporters present to report on the burial were asked by officials to act as pallbearers.', u"A marker inscribed simply Oswald replaces the stolen original tombstone, which gave Oswald's full name, and birth and death dates.", u'His mother was buried beside him in 1981.', u'A claim that a look-alike Russian agent was buried in place of Oswald led to his exhumation on October 4, 1981.', u"Dental records confirmed that it was Oswald's body in the grave and he was reburied in a new coffin due to water damage to the original.", u"In 2010, the Fort Worth funeral home that held Oswald's original coffin employed a Los Angeles auction house to sell it to an undisclosed bidder for $87,468.", u"The sale was halted after Oswald's brother, Robert, learned of the transaction in a Texas newspaper and sued to reclaim the coffin.", u'In January 2015, a district judge in Tarrant County, Texas ruled that the funeral home intentionally concealed the existence of the pine coffin from Robert Oswald who had originally purchased it and believed that it been discarded after the exhumation.', u"The court ordered it returned to Oswald's brother, plus damages equal to the sale price.", u'Robert Oswald\'s attorney stated that the coffin would likely be destroyed "as soon as possible".', u'== Official investigations ==\n\n\n=== Warren Commission ===\nThe Warren Commission, created by President Lyndon B. Johnson to investigate the assassination, concluded that Oswald acted alone in assassinating Kennedy.', u"The Commission could not ascribe any one motive or group of motives to Oswald's actions:\n\nIt is apparent, however, that Oswald was moved by an overriding hostility to his environment.", u'He does not appear to have been able to establish meaningful relationships with other people.', u'He was perpetually discontented with the world around him.', u'Long before the assassination he expressed his hatred for American society and acted in protest against it.', u"Oswald's search for what he conceived to be the perfect society was doomed from the start.", u'He sought for himself a place in history\u2014a role as the "great man" who would be recognized as having been in advance of his times.', u'His commitment to Marxism and communism appears to have been another important factor in his motivation.', u'He also had demonstrated a capacity to act decisively and without regard to the consequences when such action would further his aims of the moment.', u'Out of these and the many other factors which may have molded the character of Lee Harvey Oswald there emerged a man capable of assassinating President Kennedy.', u'The proceedings of the commission were closed, though not secret, and about 3% of its files have yet to be released to the public, which has continued to provoke speculation among researchers.', u'=== Ramsey Clark Panel ===\nIn 1968, the Ramsey Clark Panel examined various photographs, X-ray films, documents, and other evidence, concluding that Kennedy was struck by two bullets fired from above and behind him, one of which traversed the base of the neck on the right side without striking bone, and the other of which entered the skull from behind and destroyed its right side.', u'=== House Select Committee ===\n\nIn 1979, after a review of the evidence and of prior investigations, the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) largely concurred with the Warren Commission and was preparing to issue a finding that Oswald had acted alone in killing Kennedy.', u"However, late in the Committee's proceedings a dictabelt recording was introduced, purportedly recording sounds heard in Dealey Plaza before, during and after the shots were fired.", u'After an analysis by the firm Bolt, Beranek and Newman appeared to indicate more than three gunshots, the HSCA revised its findings to assert a "high probability that two gunmen fired" at Kennedy and that Kennedy "was probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy."', u'Although the Committee was "unable to identify the other gunman or the extent of the conspiracy," it made a number of further findings regarding the likelihood or unlikelihood that particular groups, named in the findings, were involved.', u'Four of the twelve members of the HSCA dissented from this conclusion.', u'The acoustical evidence has since been discredited.', u'Officer H.B.', u'McLain, from whose motorcycle radio the HSCA acoustic experts said the Dictabelt evidence came, has repeatedly stated that he was not yet in Dealey Plaza at the time of the assassination.', u'McLain asked the Committee, "\u2018If it was my radio on my motorcycle, why did it not record the revving up at high speed plus my siren when we immediately took off for Parkland Hospital?\u2019\u201d\nIn 1982, a panel of twelve scientists appointed by the National Academy of Sciences, including Nobel laureates Norman Ramsey and Luis Alvarez, unanimously concluded that the acoustic evidence submitted to the HSCA was "seriously flawed", was recorded after the President had been shot, and did not indicate additional gunshots.', u'Their conclusions were later published in the journal Science.', u'In a 2001 article in the journal Science & Justice, D.B.', u'Thomas wrote that the NAS investigation was itself flawed.', u'He concluded with a 96.3 percent certainty that there were at least two gunmen firing at President Kennedy and that at least one shot came from the grassy knoll.', u"In 2005, Thomas's conclusions were rebutted in the same journal.", u'Ralph Linsker and several members of the original NAS team reanalyzed the timings of the recordings and reaffirmed the earlier conclusion of the NAS report that the alleged shot sounds were recorded approximately one minute after the assassination.', u'In 2010, D.B.', u'Thomas challenged in a book the 2005 Science & Justice article and restated his conclusion that there were at least two gunmen.', u'== Other investigations and dissenting theories ==\n\nSome critics have not accepted the conclusions of the Warren Commission and have proposed several other theories, such as that Oswald conspired with others, or was not involved at all and was framed.', u"In October 1981, with Marina's support, Oswald's grave was opened to test a theory propounded by writer Michael Eddowes: that during Oswald's stay in the Soviet Union he was replaced with a Soviet double; that it was this double, not Oswald, who killed Kennedy and who is buried in Oswald's grave; and that the exhumed remains would therefore not exhibit a surgical scar Oswald was known to carry.", u"Dental records positively identified the exhumed corpse as Oswald's, and the scar was present.", u'=== Public opinion ===\nA 2003 Gallup poll reported that 75% of Americans do not believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in assassinating President Kennedy.', u'That same year an ABC News poll found that 70% of respondents suspected that the assassination involved more than one person.', u'A 2004 Fox News poll found that 66% of Americans thought there had been a conspiracy while 74% thought there had been a cover-up.', u'A Gallup Poll taken in mid-November 2013, showed 61% believed in a conspiracy, and only 30% thought Oswald acted alone.', u'=== Fictional trials ===\nSeveral films have fictionalized a trial of Oswald, depicting what may have happened had Ruby not killed Oswald.', u'The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald (1964); The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald (1977); and On Trial: Lee Harvey Oswald (1986) have fictionalized a trial of Oswald.', u'In 1988, a 21-hour unscripted mock trial was held on television, argued by lawyers before a judge, with unscripted testimony from surviving witnesses to the events surrounding the assassination; the jury returned a verdict of guilty.', u'In 1992 the American Bar Association conducted two mock Oswald trials.', u'The first trial ended in a hung jury.', u'In the second trial the jury acquitted Oswald.', u'== Backyard photos ==\n\nThe "backyard photos", taken by Marina Oswald probably around March 31, 1963 using a camera belonging to Oswald, show Oswald holding two Marxist newspapers\u2014The Militant and The Worker\u2014and a rifle, and wearing a pistol in a holster.', u"Shown the pictures after his arrest, Oswald insisted they were forgeries, but Marina testified in 1964 that she had taken the photographs at Oswald's request\u2014 testimony she reaffirmed repeatedly over the decades.", u'These photos were labelled CE 133-A and CE 133-B.', u"CE 133-A shows the rifle in Oswald's left hand and newspapers in front of his chest in the other, while the rifle is held with the right hand in CE 133-B.", u'Oswald\'s mother testified that on the day after the assassination she and Marina destroyed another photograph with Oswald holding the rifle with both hands over his head, with "To my daughter June" written on it.', u'The HSCA obtained another first-generation print (from CE 133-A) on April 1, 1977, from the widow of George de Mohrenschildt.', u'The words "Hunter of fascists\u2014ha ha ha!"', u'written in block Russian were on the back.', u'Also in English were added in script: "To my friend George, Lee Oswald, 5/IV/63 [April 5, 1963]."', u'Handwriting experts for the HSCA concluded the English inscription and signature were by Oswald.', u'After two original photos, one negative and one first-generation copy had been found, the Senate Intelligence Committee located (in 1976) a third backyard photo (CE 133-C) showing Oswald with newspapers held away from his body in his right hand.', u'These photos, widely recognized as some of the most significant evidence against Oswald, have been subjected to rigorous analysis.', u'Photographic experts consulted by the HSCA concluded they were genuine, answering twenty-one points raised by critics.', u"Marina Oswald has always maintained she took the photos herself, and the 1963 de Mohrenschildt print bearing Oswald's signature clearly indicate they existed before the assassination.", u'Nonetheless, some continue to contest their authenticity.', u'In 2009, after digitally analyzing the photograph of Oswald holding the rifle and paper, computer scientist Hany Farid concluded that the photo "almost certainly was not altered."', u'== See also ==\n\nJohn F.

United States as an independent government.', u'Benjamin Franklin established the first overseas mission of the United States in Paris in 1779.', u'On April 19, 1782, John Adams was received by the States-General and the Dutch Republic as they were the first country together with Morocco and France, to recognize the United States as an independent government.', u'Adams then became the first U.S.

{'sentences': [u'A battle is a combat in warfare between two or more armed forces, or combatants.', u'A war sometimes consists of many battles.', u'Battles generally are well defined in duration, area, and force commitment.', u'Wars and military campaigns are guided by strategy, whereas battles take place on a level of planning and execution known as operational mobility.', u'German strategist Carl von Clausewitz stated that "the employment of battles ... to achieve the object of war" was the essence of strategy.', u'== Etymology ==\nBattle is a loanword from the Old French bataille, first attested in 1297, from Late Latin battualia, meaning "exercise of soldiers and gladiators in fighting and fencing", from Late Latin (taken from Germanic) battuere "beat", from which the English word battery is also derived via Middle English batri.', u'== Characteristics ==\nThe defining characteristic of the fight as a concept in Military science has been a dynamic one through the course of military history, changing with the changes in the organisation, employment and technology of military forces.', u'While the English military historian Sir John Keegan suggested an ideal definition of battle as "something which happens between two armies leading to the moral then physical disintegration of one or the other of them", the origins and outcomes of battles can rarely be summarized so neatly.', u'In general a battle during the 20th century was, and continues to be, defined by the combat between opposing forces representing major components of total forces committed to a military campaign, used to achieve specific military objectives.', u'Where the duration of the battle is longer than a week, it is often for reasons of staff operational planning called an operation.', u'Battles can be planned, encountered, or forced by one force on the other when the latter is unable to withdraw from combat.', u'A battle always has as its purpose the reaching of a mission goal by use of military force.', u'A victory in the battle is achieved when one of the opposing sides forces the other to abandon its mission, or to surrender its forces, or routs the other, i.e., forces it to retreat or renders it militarily ineffective for further combat operations.', u'However, a battle may end in a Pyrrhic victory, which ultimately favors the defeated party.', u'If no resolution is reached in a battle, it can result in a stalemate.', u'A conflict in which one side is unwilling to reach a decision by a direct battle using conventional warfare often becomes an insurgency.', u'Until the 19th century the majority of battles were of short duration, many lasting a part of a day.', u'(The Battle of Nations (1813) and the Battle of Gettysburg (1863) were exceptional in lasting three days.)', u'This was mainly due to the difficulty of supplying armies in the field, or conducting night operations.', u'The means of prolonging a battle was typically by employment of siege warfare.', u'Improvements in transportation and the sudden evolving of trench warfare, with its siege-like nature during World War I in the 20th century, lengthened the duration of battles to days and weeks.', u'This created the requirement for unit rotation to prevent combat fatigue, with troops preferably not remaining in a combat area of operations for more than a month.', u'Trench warfare had become largely obsolete in conflicts between advanced armies by the start of the Second World War.', u'The use of the term "battle" in military history has led to its misuse when referring to almost any scale of combat, notably by strategic forces involving hundreds of thousands of troops that may be engaged in either a single battle at one time (Battle of Leipzig) or multiple operations (Battle of Kursk).', u'The space a battle occupies depends on the range of the weapons of the combatants.', u'A "battle" in this broader sense may be of long duration and take place over a large area, as in the case of the Battle of Britain or the Battle of the Atlantic.', u'Until the advent of artillery and aircraft, battles were fought with the two sides within sight, if not reach, of each other.', u'The depth of the battlefield has also increased in modern warfare with inclusion of the supporting units in the rear areas; supply, artillery, medical personnel etc.', u'often outnumber the front-line combat troops.', u"Battles are, on the whole, made up of a multitude of individual combats, skirmishes and small engagements within the context of which the combatants will usually only experience a small part of the events of the battle's entirety.", u"To the infantryman, there may be little to distinguish between combat as part of a minor raid or as a major offensive, nor is it likely that he anticipates the future course of the battle; few of the British infantry who went over the top on the first day on the Somme, July 1, 1916, would have anticipated that they would be fighting the same battle in five months' time.", u'Conversely, some of the Allied infantry who had just dealt a crushing defeat to the French at the Battle of Waterloo fully expected to have to fight again the next day (at the Battle of Wavre).', u'== Battlespace ==\n\nBattlespace is a unified strategy to integrate and combine armed forces for the military theatre of operations, including air, information, land, sea and space.', u'It includes the environment, factors and conditions that must be understood to successfully apply combat power, protect the force, or complete the mission.', u'This includes enemy and friendly armed forces; facilities; weather; terrain; and the electromagnetic spectrum within the operational areas and areas of interest.', u'== Factors ==\nBattles are decided by various factors.', u'The number and quality of combatants and equipment, the skill of the commanders of each army, and the terrain advantages are among the most prominent factors.', u'A unit may charge with high morale but less discipline and still emerge victorious.', u'This tactic was effectively used by the early French Revolutionary Armies.', u'Weapons and armour can be a decisive factor.', u'On many occasions armies have achieved victories largely owing to the employment of more advanced weapons than those of their opponents.', u'An extreme example was in the Battle of Omdurman, in which a large army of Sudanese Mahdists armed in a traditional manner were destroyed by an Anglo-Egyptian force equipped with Maxim guns.', u'On some occasions, simple weapons employed in an unorthodox fashion have proven advantageous, as with the Swiss pikemen who gained many victories through their ability to transform a traditionally defensive weapon into an offensive one.', u'Likewise, the Zulus in the early 19th century were victorious in battles against their rivals in part because they adopted a new kind of spear, the iklwa.', u'Even so, forces with inferior weapons have still emerged victorious at times, for example in the Wars of Scottish Independence and in the First Italo\u2013Ethiopian War.', u'Discipline within the troops is often of greater importance; at the Battle of Alesia, the Romans were greatly outnumbered but won because of superior training.', u'Battles can also be determined by terrain.', u'Capturing high ground, for example, has been the central strategy in innumerable battles.', u'An army that holds the high ground forces the enemy to climb, and thus wear themselves down.', u'Areas of dense vegetation, such as jungles and forest, act as force-multipliers, of benefit to inferior armies.', u'Arguably, terrain is of less importance in modern warfare, due to the advent of aircraft, though terrain is still vital for camouflage, especially for guerrilla warfare.', u'Generals and commanders also play a decisive role during combat.', u'Hannibal, Julius Caesar, Khalid ibn Walid and Napoleon Bonaparte were all skilled generals and, consequently, their armies were extremely successful.', u'An army that can trust the commands of their leaders with conviction in its success invariably has a higher morale than an army that doubts its every move.', u'The British in the naval Battle of Trafalgar, for example, owed its success to the reputation of celebrated admiral Lord Nelson.', u'== Types ==\n\nBattles can be fought on land, at sea and, in the modern age, in the air.', u'Naval battles have occurred since before the 5th century BC.', u'Air battles have been far less common, due to their late conception, the most prominent being the Battle of Britain in 1940.', u'However, since the Second World War land or sea battles have come to rely on air support.', u'Indeed, during the Battle of Midway, five aircraft carriers were sunk without either fleet coming into direct contact.', u'There are numerous types of battles:\nA battle of encounter (or encounter battle) is a meeting engagement where the opposing sides collide in the field without either having prepared their attack or defence.', u"A battle of attrition aims to inflict losses on an enemy that are less sustainable compared to one's own losses.", u'These need not be greater numerical losses \u2013 if one side is much more numerous than the other than pursuing a strategy based on attrition can work even if casualties on both sides are about equal.', u'Many battles of the Western Front in the First World War were intentionally (Verdun) or unintentionally (Somme) attrition battles.', u"A battle of breakthrough aims to pierce the enemy's defences, thereby exposing the vulnerable flanks which can be turned.", u'A battle of encirclement\u2014the Kesselschlacht of the German Blitzkrieg\u2014surrounds the enemy in a pocket.', u'A battle of envelopment involves an attack on one or both flanks; the classic example being the double-envelopment of the Battle of Cannae.', u'A battle of annihilation is one in which the defeated party is destroyed in the field, such as the French fleet at the Battle of the Nile.', u'Battles frequently do not fit one particular type perfectly, and are usually hybrids of different types listed above.', u'A decisive battle is one of particular importance; often by bringing hostilities to an end, such as the Battle of Hastings or the Battle of Hattin, or as a turning point in the fortunes of the belligerents, such as the Battle of Stalingrad.', u'A decisive battle can have political as well as military impact, changing the balance of power or boundaries between countries.', u"The concept of the decisive battle became popular with the publication in 1851 of Edward Creasy's The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World.", u'British military historians J.F.C.', u'Fuller (The Decisive Battles of the Western World) and B.H.', u"Liddell Hart (Decisive Wars of History), among many others, have written books in the style of Creasy's work.", u'=== Land ===\nThere is an obvious difference in the way battles have been fought throughout time.', u'Early battles were probably fought between rival hunting bands as disorganized mobs.', u'However, during the Battle of Megiddo, the first reliably documented battle in the fifteenth century BC, actual discipline was instilled in both armies.', u'However, during the many wars of the Roman Empire, barbarians continued using mob tactics.', u'As the Age of Enlightenment dawned, armies began to fight in highly disciplined lines.', u'Each would follow the orders from their officers and fight as a single unit instead of individuals.', u'Each army was successively divided into regiments, battalions, companies, and platoons.', u'These armies would march, line up, and fire in divisions.', u'Native Americans, on the other hand, did not fight in lines, utilizing instead guerrilla tactics.', u'American colonists and European forces continued using disciplined lines, continuing into the American Civil War.', u'A new style, during World War I, known as trench warfare, developed nearly half a century later.', u'This also led to radio for communication between battalions.', u'Chemical warfare also emerged with the use of poisonous gas during World War I.', u'By World War II, the use of the smaller divisions, platoons and companies became much more important as precise operations became vital.', u'Instead of the locked trench warfare of World War I, during World War II, a dynamic network of battles developed where small groups encountered other platoons.', u'As a result, elite squads became much more recognized and distinguishable.', u'Maneuver warfare also developed with an astonishing pace with the advent of the tank, replacing the archaic cannons of the Enlightenment Age.', u'Artillery has since gradually replaced the use of frontal troops.', u'Modern battles now continue to resemble those of World War II, though prominent innovations have been added.', u'Indirect combat through the use of aircraft and missiles now constitutes a large portion of wars in place of battles, where battles are now mostly reserved for capturing cities.', u'=== Naval ===\n\nOne significant difference of modern naval battles as opposed to earlier forms of combat is the use of marines, which introduced amphibious warfare.', u'Today, a marine is actually an infantry regiment that sometimes fights solely on land and is no longer tied to the navy.', u'A good example of an old naval battle is the Battle of Salamis.', u'Most ancient naval battles were fought by fast ships using the battering ram to sink opposing fleets or steer close enough for boarding in hand-to-hand combat.', u'Troops were often used to storm enemy ships as used by Romans and pirates.', u'This tactic was usually used by civilizations that could not beat the enemy with ranged weaponry.', u'Another invention in the late Middle Ages was the use of Greek fire by the Byzantines, which was used to set enemy fleets on fire.', u'Empty demolition ships utilized the tactic to crash into opposing ships and set it afire with an explosion.', u'After the invention of cannons, naval warfare became useful as support units for land warfare.', u'During the 19th century, the development of mines led to a new type of naval warfare.', u'The ironclad, first used in the American Civil War, resistant to cannons, soon made the wooden ship obsolete.', u'The invention of military submarines, during World War I, brought naval warfare to both above and below the surface.', u'With the development of military aircraft during World War II, battles were fought in the sky as well as below the ocean.', u'Aircraft carriers have since become the central unit in naval warfare, acting as a mobile base for lethal aircraft.', u'=== Aerial ===\nAlthough the use of aircraft has for the most part always been used as a supplement to land or naval engagements, since their first major military use in World War I aircraft have increasingly taken on larger roles in warfare.', u'During World War I, the primary use was for reconnaissance, and small-scale bombardment.', u'Aircraft began becoming much more prominent in the Spanish Civil War and especially World War II.', u'Aircraft design began specializing, primarily into two types: bombers, which carried explosive payloads to bomb land targets or ships; and fighter-interceptors, which were used to either intercept incoming aircraft or to escort and protect bombers (engagements between fighter aircraft were known as dog fights).', u'Some of the more notable aerial battles in this period include the Battle of Britain and the Battle of Midway.', u'Another important use of aircraft came with the development of the helicopter, which first became heavily used during the Vietnam War, and still continues to be widely used today to transport and augment ground forces.', u'Today, direct engagements between aircraft are rare \u2013 the most modern fighter-interceptors carry much more extensive bombing payloads, and are used to bomb precision land targets, rather than to fight other aircraft.', u'Anti-aircraft batteries are used much more extensively to defend against incoming aircraft than interceptors.', u'Despite this, aircraft today are much more extensively used as the primary tools for both army and navy, as evidenced by the prominent use of helicopters to transport and support troops, the use of aerial bombardment as the "first strike" in many engagements, and the replacement of the battleship with the aircraft carrier as the center of most modern navies.', u'== Naming ==\n\nBattles are usually named after some feature of the battlefield geography, such as the name of a town, forest or river, commonly prefixed "Battle of...".', u'Occasionally battles are named after the date on which they took place, such as The Glorious First of June.', u'In the Middle Ages it was considered important to settle on a suitable name for a battle which could be used by the chroniclers.', u'For example, after Henry V of England defeated a French army on October 25, 1415, he met with the senior French herald and they agreed to name the battle after the nearby castle and so it was called the Battle of Agincourt.', u'In other cases, the sides adopted different names for the same battle, such as the Battle of Gallipoli which is known in Turkey as the Battle of \xc7anakkale.', u'During the American Civil War, the Union tended to name the battles after the nearest watercourse, such as the Battle of Wilsons Creek and the Battle of Stones River, whereas the Confederates favoured the nearby towns, as in the Battles of Chancellorsville and Murfreesboro.', u'Occasionally both names for the same battle entered the popular culture, such as the First and Second Battle of Bull Run, which are also referred to as the First and Second Battle of Manassas.', u'Sometimes in desert warfare, there is no nearby town name to use; map coordinates gave the name to the Battle of 73 Easting in the First Gulf War.', u'Some place names have become synonymous with the battles that took place there, such as the Passchendaele, Pearl Harbor, the Alamo, Thermopylae, or Waterloo.', u'Military operations, many of which result in battle, are given codenames, which are not necessarily meaningful or indicative of the type or the location of the battle.', u'Operation Market Garden and Operation Rolling Thunder are examples of battles known by their military codenames.', u'When a battleground is the site of more than one battle in the same conflict, the instances are distinguished by ordinal number, such as the First and Second Battles of Bull Run.', u'An extreme case are the twelve Battles of the Isonzo\u2014First to Twelfth\u2014between Italy and Austria-Hungary during the First World War.', u'Some battles are named for the convenience of military historians so that periods of combat can be neatly distinguished from one another.', u'Following the First World War, the British Battles Nomenclature Committee was formed to decide on standard names for all battles and subsidiary actions.', u'To the soldiers who did the fighting, the distinction was usually academic; a soldier fighting at Beaumont Hamel on November 13, 1916 was probably unaware he was taking part in what the committee would call the "Battle of the Ancre".', u'Many combats are too small to merit a name.', u'Terms such as "action", "skirmish", "firefight", "raid" or "offensive patrol" are used to describe small-scale battle-like encounters.', u'These combats often take place within the time and space of a battle and while they may have an objective, they are not necessarily "decisive".', u'Sometimes the soldiers are unable to immediately gauge the significance of the combat; in the aftermath of the Battle of Waterloo, some British officers were in doubt as to whether the day\'s events merited the title of "battle" or would be passed off as merely an "action".', u'== Effects ==\nBattles affect the individuals who take part, as well as the political actors.', u'Personal effects of battle range from mild psychological issues to permanent and crippling injuries.', u'Some battle-survivors have nightmares about the conditions they encountered, or abnormal reactions to certain sights or sounds.', u'Some suffer flashbacks.', u'Physical effects of battle can include scars, amputations, lesions, loss of bodily functions, blindness, paralysis \u2014 and death.', u'Battles also affect politics.', u'A decisive battle can cause the losing side to surrender, while a Pyrrhic Victory such as the Battle of Asculum can cause the winning side to reconsider its long-term goals.', u'Battles in civil wars have often decided the fate of monarchs or political factions.', u'Famous examples include the War of the Roses, as well as the Jacobite Uprisings.', u'Battles also affect the commitment of one side or the other to the continuance of a war, for example the Battle of Incheon and the Battle of Hue during the Tet Offensive.', u'== See also ==\nList of battles\nMilitary strategy\nMilitary tactics\nNaval battle\nPitched

[the] most machine-tooled of Hollywood ingenues."', u"== Later career ==\n\nWood's characters in Rebel Without a Cause, The Searchers and Marjorie Morningstar began to show her widening range of acting styles, observes Tibbetts.", u'Her former "childlike sweetness" was now being combined with a noticeable "restlessness that was characteristic of the youth of the 1950s."', u"After Wood appeared in the box office flop All the Fine Young Cannibals (1960), her career was salvaged by her casting in director Elia Kazan's Splendor in the Grass (1961) opposite Warren Beatty, which earned Wood Best Actress Nominations at the Academy Awards, Golden Globes and BAFTA Awards.", u"Wood's career was in a transition period, having until then consisted of roles as a child or as a teenager.", u'She was now hoping to be cast in adult roles.', u'Biographer Suzanne Finstad notes that a "turning point" in her life as an actress took place upon seeing the film A Streetcar Named Desire (1951): "She was transformed, in awe of director Elia Kazan and of Vivien Leigh\'s performance ... [who] became a role model for Natalie."', u'"Her roles raised the possibility that one\'s sensitivity could mark a person as a kind of victim," noted Tibbetts.', u'In 1961, after a "series of bad films, her career was already in decline", notes Rathgeb.', u'Kazan himself writes that the "sages" of the film community declared her "washed up" as an actress, although he still wanted to interview her for his next film:\n\nWhen I saw her, I detected behind the well-mannered \'young wife\' front a desperate twinkle in her eyes ...', u'I talked with her more quietly then and more personally.', u'I wanted to find out what human material was there, what her inner life was ... Then she told me she was being psychoanalyzed.', u'That did it.', u'Poor R.J., I said to myself.', u'I liked Bob Wagner, I still do.', u'Kazan cast Wood as the female lead in Splendor in the Grass, and her career rebounded.', u'He felt that despite her earlier, innocent roles, she had the talent and maturity to go beyond them.', u'In the film, Warren Beatty\'s character was deprived of sexual love with Natalie\'s character, and as a result turns to another "looser" girl; Natalie\'s character, likewise, couldn\'t handle the issue, but ended up in a mental institution.', u'Kazan writes that he cast her in the role partly because he saw in Wood\'s personality a "true-blue quality with a wanton side that is held down by social pressure," adding that "she clings to things with her eyes," a quality he found especially "appealing."', u'Finstad felt that despite Wood never having received training in Method acting techniques, "working with Kazan brought her to the greatest emotional heights of her career.', u'The experience was exhilarating but wrenching for Natalie, who faced her demons on Splendor."', u'She adds that a scene in the film, as a result of "Kazan\'s wizardry ... produced a hysteria in Natalie that may be her most powerful moment as an actress."', u'Actor Gary Lockwood, who also acted in the film, felt that "Kazan and Natalie were a terrific marriage, because you had this beautiful girl, and you had somebody that could get things out of her."', u"Kazan's favorite scene in the movie was the last one, when Wood goes back to see her lost first love, Bud (Beatty).", u'"It\'s terribly touching to me.', u'I still like it when I see it," writes Kazan.', u'In 1961, Wood played Maria in the Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise musical West Side Story, which was a major box office and critical success.', u'Tibbetts notes similarities in her role in this film and the earlier Rebel Without a Cause.', u'Here, she also plays the role of a restless adolescent reflecting the "restlessness of American youth in the 1950s", expressed by youth gangs and juvenile delinquency, along with early rock & roll.', u'Both films, he observes, were "modern allegories based on the \'Romeo and Juliet\' theme, including private restlessness and public alienation.', u'Where in Rebel she falls in love with the character played by James Dean, whose gang-like friends and violent temper alienated him from his family, in West Side Story she also enters into a romance with a gang member and his threatening world of outcasts, also alienated from their families and the law.', u"Although the singing parts were sung by Marni Nixon, West Side Story is still regarded as one of Wood's best films.", u'Wood did sing when she starred in the 1962 film Gypsy.', u'She co-starred in the slapstick comedy The Great Race (1965), with Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis, and Peter Falk.', u"Her ability to speak Russian was an asset given to her character Maggie DuBois, justifying the character's recording the progress of the race across Siberia, and entering the race at the beginning as a contestant.", u'In 1964, Wood was nominated for her third Academy Award nomination for Love with the Proper Stranger, making Wood, 25 at the time, the youngest actress to ever net three Oscar nominations.', u'Wood held the record for exactly 50 years until 23-year-old Jennifer Lawrence received her third nomination in 2014.', u"Although many of Wood's films were commercially profitable, her acting was criticized at times.", u'In 1966, she won the Harvard Lampoon Worst Actress of the Year Award.', u'She was the first performer in the award\'s history to accept it in person and the The Harvard Crimson wrote she was "quite a good sport".', u'Director Sydney Pollack was quoted as saying about Wood, "When she was right for the part, there was no one better.', u'She was a damn good actress."', u'Other notable films starring Wood were Inside Daisy Clover (1965) and This Property Is Condemned (1966), both of which co-starred Robert Redford and brought subsequent Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress.', u'In both films, which were set during the Great Depression, Wood played small-town teens with big dreams.', u'After the release of the films, Wood suffered emotionally and sought professional therapy.', u'During this time, she turned down the Faye Dunaway role in Bonnie and Clyde (1967) because she did not want to be separated from her analyst.', u'After three years away from acting, Wood co-starred with Elliott Gould in the hit Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice (1969), a comedy about sexual liberation.', u'According to Tibbets, this was the first film in which "the saving leavening of humor was brought to bear upon the many painful dilemmas portrayed in her adult films".', u'After becoming pregnant in 1970 with her first child, Natasha Gregson, Wood went into semi-retirement and acted in only four more theatrical films during the remainder of her life.', u'She made a very brief cameo appearance as herself in The Candidate (1972), reuniting her for a third time with Robert Redford.', u'She also reunited on the screen with Robert Wagner in the television movie of the week The Affair (1973) and with Laurence Olivier and husband Wagner in an adaptation of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1976) broadcast as a special by NBC.', u'She made cameo appearances on Wagner\'s prime-time detective series Switch in 1978 as "Bubble Bath Girl" and Hart to Hart in 1979 as "Movie Star".', u'During the last two years of her life, Wood began to work more frequently as her daughters reached school age.', u'Film roles that Wood turned down during her career hiatus went to Ali MacGraw in Goodbye, Columbus; Mia Farrow in The Great Gatsby; and Faye Dunaway in The Towering Inferno.', u'Later, Wood chose to star in bombs like the disaster film Meteor (1979) with Sean Connery and the sex comedy The Last Married Couple in America (1980), although her performance in the latter was praised, and considered reminiscent of her performance in Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice.', u'It was also in Last Married Couple that Wood broke ground by being an actress with a clean, middle class image, yet using the "F" word in a frank, marital discussion with her husband (George Segal).', u'She found more success in television, receiving high ratings and critical acclaim in 1979 for The Cracker Factory and especially the miniseries film Here to Eternity, with Kim Basinger and William Devane.', u"Wood's performance in the latter won her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in 1980.", u'Later that year, she starred in The Memory of Eva Ryker, which proved to be her last completed production.', u'At the time of her death, Wood was filming the science fiction film Brainstorm (1983), co-starring Christopher Walken and directed by Douglas Trumbull.', u'She was also scheduled to star in a theatrical production of Anastasia with Wendy Hiller and in a film called Country of the Heart, playing a terminally ill writer who has an affair with a teenager, to be played by Timothy Hutton.', u'Due to her untimely death, both of the latter projects were canceled and the ending of Brainstorm had to be re-written.', u'A stand-in and sound-alikes were used to replace Wood for some of her critical scenes.', u'The film was released posthumously on September 30, 1983, and was dedicated to her in the closing credits.', u'Wood appeared in 56 films for cinema and television.', u'Following her death, Time magazine noted that although critical praise for Wood had been sparse throughout her career, "she always had work".', u"== Personal life ==\nWood's two marriages to actor Robert Wagner were highly publicized.", u'Wood said that she had had a crush on Wagner since she was a child, and on her 18th birthday she went on a studio-arranged date with the 26-year-old actor.', u"They married a year later on December 28, 1957; it was a union that met with great protest from Wood's mother.", u'In an article in February 2009, Wagner recalled their early romance:\n\nI saw Natalie around town but she never seemed interested.', u'She was making Rebel Without a Cause and hanging out with James Dean; I was with an older crowd.', u'The first time I remember really talking to her was at a fashion show in 1956.', u'She was beautiful, but still gave no hint about the mad crush she had on me.', u'I later found out she had signed with my agent simply because he was my agent.', u'A month later, I invited Natalie to a premiere on what turned out to be her 18th birthday.', u'At dinner, we both sensed things were different.', u'I sent her flowers and the dates continued.', u'I remember the instant I fell in love with her.', u'One night on board a small boat I owned, she looked at me with love, her dark brown eyes lit by a table lantern.', u'That moment changed my life.', u'Wood and Wagner separated in June 1961 and divorced in April 1962.', u'On May 30, 1969, Wood married British producer Richard Gregson.', u'The couple had dated for two and a half years prior to their marriage, while Gregson waited for his divorce to be finalized.', u'In 1970 they had a daughter, Natasha.', u'They separated in August 1971 after Wood overheard an inappropriate telephone conversation between her secretary and Gregson.', u'The split also marked a brief estrangement between Wood and her family, when mother Maria and sister Lana told her to reconcile with Gregson for the sake of her newborn child.', u'She filed for divorce, and it was finalized in April 1972.', u'In early 1972, Wood resumed her relationship with Wagner.', u'The couple remarried on July 16, 1972, five months after reconciling and three months after she divorced Gregson.', u'Their daughter, Courtney Wagner, was born in 1974.', u"Wood's sister, Lana Wood, recalls this period:\n\nHer marriage was considered to be one of the best in Hollywood, and there is no question that she was a devoted, loving\u2014even adoring\u2014mother and stepmother.", u'She and R.J. had begun with love and built from there.', u"They had overcome each other's problems and had reached an accommodation with time, and the changes time brings.", u'As with anybody else who has settled into making a long marriage work, they were far more determined than most people to make it work ...', u"They remained married until Wood's untimely death seven years later on November 29, 1981 at age 43.", u'== Death ==\nDuring the making of the film Brainstorm, Wood drowned while on a weekend boat trip to Santa Catalina Island on board the Splendour.', u'Many of the circumstances surrounding her drowning are unknown because it was never determined how she entered the water.', u"She was with her husband Robert Wagner, Brainstorm co-star Christopher Walken, and the Splendour's captain, Dennis Davern, on the evening of November 28, 1981.", u"Wood's body was recovered by authorities at 8:00 a.m. on November 29, one mile away from the boat, with a small inflatable dinghy, named the Valiant, found beached nearby.", u'According to Wagner, when he went to bed, Wood was not there.', u'The autopsy report revealed that Wood had bruises on her body and arms as well as an abrasion on her left cheek.', u'Later, in his book Pieces of My Heart, Wagner acknowledged that he had an argument with Wood before she disappeared.', u"The autopsy also found that Wood's blood alcohol level was 0.14%, and there were traces of two types of medication in her bloodstream: a motion-sickness pill and a painkiller, which increase the effects of alcohol.", u'Following his investigation, Los Angeles County coroner Thomas Noguchi ruled her death an accident by drowning and hypothermia.', u'According to Noguchi, Wood had been drinking and may have slipped while trying to re-board the dinghy.', u'Wood was buried in Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.', u"Scores of representatives of international media, photographers, and members of the public tried to attend Wood's funeral; however, all were required to remain outside the cemetery walls.", u'Among the celebrity attendees were Frank Sinatra, Elizabeth Taylor, Fred Astaire, Rock Hudson, David Niven, Gregory Peck, Gene Kelly, Elia Kazan and Laurence Olivier.', u'Olivier flew from London to Los Angeles to attend the service.', u'After a thirty year hiatus, the case was reopened in November, 2011 after the captain of the boat, Dennis Davern, publicly stated that he had lied to police during the initial investigation and that Wood and Wagner had an argument that evening, and alleged that Wagner was responsible for her death.', u'After nine months of further investigation, Los Angeles County Chief Medical Examiner, Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran, amended Wood\'s death certificate and changed the cause of her death from accidental drowning to "drowning and other undetermined factors."', u'The amended document included a statement that the circumstances of how Wood ended up in the water are "not clearly established".', u"The coroner's office had been instructed by detectives not to discuss or comment on the case.", u"On January 14, 2013, the Los Angeles County coroner's office offered a 10-page addendum to Wood's autopsy report stating that some of the bruises on her body may have been sustained before she went into the water and drowned, but that could not be definitively determined.", u'Forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Hunter has speculated that Wood was particularly susceptible to bruising due to the drug synthroid that she had taken.', u"Douglas Trumbull, director of Brainstorm, quit directing after Wood's death in 1981.", u'In 2013, he explained that the uncertain circumstances of her death were the main reason for this decision.', u'He has since returned to filmmaking.', u"Wagner has denied any involvement in Wood's death.", u'== Tribute ==\nSeveral songs were written about or mention Wood, including "Natalie Wood" (1980, written by Jay Alanski, cover by Jil Caplan), "Natalie\'s Song" (David Pack), and "Eyes Like Natalie Wood" (Kathy Fleischmann).', u'In 1999, Julian Daze and the Photon Karma recorded "Natalie Wood", written by singer/songwriter Brian Bell, and released on the Stories of Old album.', u'In 2002 The Handsome Family wrote a haunting song "Natalie Wood" later released on their Twilight album.', u'In 2015, the band TV Girl released a song titled "Natalie Wood".', u'A 2004 TV film titled The Mystery of Natalie Wood was directed by Peter Bogdanovich and starred Justine Waddell and Michael Weatherly.', u'In 2015, an eau de parfum fragrance was released called "Natalie", and featuring gardenia, which was her favourite scent.', u'== Filmography

{'sentences': [u'Whittaker Chambers (born Jay Vivian Chambers; April 1, 1901 \u2013 July 9, 1961) also known as Jay David Whittaker Chambers, was an American writer, editor, and Soviet spy.', u'After early years as a Communist Party member (1925) and Soviet spy (1932\u20131938), he defected from communism (underground and open party) and worked at Time magazine (1939\u20131948).', u"Under subpoena in 1948, he testified in what became Alger Hiss's perjury (espionage) trials (1949\u20131950) and he became an outspoken anti-communist (all described in his 1952 memoir Witness).", u'Afterwards, he worked briefly as a senior editor at National Review (1957\u20131959).', u'President Ronald Reagan awarded him the Medal of Freedom in 1984.', u'== Youth and education ==\nChambers was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and spent his infancy in Brooklyn.', u'His family moved to Lynbrook, Long Island, New York, in 1904, where he grew up and attended school.', u'His parents were Jay Chambers and Laha (Whittaker).', u"Chambers described his childhood as troubled because of his parents' separation and their need to care for their mentally ill grandmother.", u'His father was a half-closeted homosexual and treated Whittaker cruelly, while his mother was neurotic.', u"Chambers' brother committed suicide shortly after withdrawing from his first year of college.", u"Chambers would cite his brother's fate as one of many reasons that he was drawn to communism at that time.", u'As he wrote, communism "offered me what nothing else in the dying world had power to offer at the same intensity, faith and a vision, something for which to live and something for which to die.\u201d\nAfter graduating from South Side High School in neighboring Rockville Centre in 1919, Chambers worked itinerantly in Washington and New Orleans, briefly attended Williams College, and then enrolled as a day student at Columbia College of Columbia University.', u'At Columbia his fellow undergraduates included Meyer Schapiro, Frank S. Hogan, Herbert Solow, Louis Zukofsky, Clifton Fadiman, Elliott V. Bell, John Gassner, Lionel Trilling (who later fictionalized him as a main character in his novel The Middle of the Journey), and Guy Endore.', u'In the intellectual environment of Columbia he gained friends and respect.', u'His professors and fellow students found him a talented writer and believed he might become a major poet or novelist.', u"In his sophomore year, Chambers joined the Boar's Head Society and wrote a play called A Play for Puppets for Columbia's literary magazine The Morningside, which he edited.", u'The work was deemed blasphemous by many students and administrators, and the controversy spread to New York City newspapers.', u'Later, the play would be used against Chambers during his testimony against Alger Hiss.', u'Disheartened over the controversy, Chambers left Columbia in 1925.', u"From Columbia, Chambers also knew Isaiah Oggins, who went into the Soviet underground a few years earlier; Chambers' wife, Esther Shemitz Chambers, knew Oggins' wife, Nerma Berman Oggins, from the Rand School of Social Science, the ILGWU, and The World Tomorrow.", u"== Communism and espionage ==\nIn 1924, Chambers read Vladimir Lenin's Soviets at Work and was deeply affected by it.", u'He now saw the dysfunctional nature of his family, he would write, as "in miniature the whole crisis of the middle class"; a malaise from which Communism promised liberation.', u'Chambers\'s biographer Sam Tanenhaus wrote that Lenin\'s authoritarianism was "precisely what attracts Chambers...', u'He had at last found his church"; that is, he became a Marxist.', u'In 1925, Chambers joined the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA) (then known as the Workers Party of America).', u'Chambers wrote and edited for Communist publications, including The Daily Worker newspaper and The New Masses magazine.', u'Combining his literary talents with his devotion to Communism, Chambers wrote four short stories in 1931 about proletarian hardship and revolt, including Can You Make Out Their Voices?, considered by critics as one of the best pieces of fiction from the American Communist movement.', u'Hallie Flanagan co-adapted and produced it as a play entitled Can You Hear Their Voices?', u'(q.v.', u'Bibliography of Whittaker Chambers), staged across America and in many other countries.', u"Chambers also worked as a translator during this period; among his works was the English version of Felix Salten's 1923 novel Bambi, A Life in the Woods.", u'=== Harold Ware ===\nChambers was recruited to join the "Communist underground" and began his career as a spy, working for a GRU apparatus headed by Alexander Ulanovsky (aka Ulrich).', u'Later, his main controller in the underground was Josef Peters (whom CPUSA General Secretary Earl Browder later replaced with Rudy Baker).', u"Chambers claimed Peters introduced him to Harold Ware (although he later denied he had ever been introduced to Ware), and that he was head of a Communist underground cell in Washington that reportedly included:\nApart from Marion Bachrach, these people were all members of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal administration.", u'Chambers worked in Washington as an organizer among Communists in the city and as a courier between New York and Washington for stolen documents which were delivered to Boris Bykov, the GRU station chief.', u'=== Other covert sources ===\nUsing the codename "Karl" or "Carl", Chambers served during the mid-1930s as a courier between various covert sources and Soviet intelligence.', u'In addition to the Ware group mentioned above, other sources that Chambers dealt with allegedly included:\n\n\n== Break with Communism ==\nChambers carried on his espionage activities from 1932 until 1937 or 1938 even while his faith in Communism was waning.', u"He became increasingly disturbed by Joseph Stalin's Great Purge, which began in 1936.", u"He was also fearful for his own life, having noted the murder in Switzerland of Ignace Reiss, a high-ranking Soviet spy who had broken with Stalin, and the disappearance of Chambers' friend and fellow spy Juliet Poyntz in the United States.", u'Poyntz had vanished in 1937, shortly after she had visited Moscow and returned disillusioned with the Communist cause due to the Stalinist Purges.', u'Chambers ignored several orders that he travel to Moscow, worried that he might be "purged."', u'He also started concealing some of the documents he collected from his sources.', u'He planned to use these, along with several rolls of microfilm photographs of documents, as a "life preserver" to prevent the Soviets from killing him and his family.', u'In 1938, Chambers broke with Communism and took his family into hiding, storing the "life preserver" at the home of his nephew and his parents.', u'Initially he had no plans to give information on his espionage activities to the U.S. government.', u'His espionage contacts were his friends, and he had no desire to inform on them.', u"In his examination of Chambers' conversion from the political left to the right, author Daniel Oppenheimer noted that Chambers substituted his passion for communism for a passion for God.", u'Chambers saw the world in black and white terms both before his defection and after.', u'In his autobiography, he presented his devotion to communism as a reason for living, but after defecting saw his actions as being part of an "absolute evil."', u'=== Berle meeting ===\nThe August 1939 Hitler-Stalin non-aggression pact drove Chambers to take action against the Soviet Union.', u'In September 1939, at the urging of anti-Communist, Russian-born journalist Isaac Don Levine, Chambers and Levine met with Assistant Secretary of State Adolf Berle.', u'Levine had introduced Chambers to Walter Krivitsky, who was already informing American and British authorities about Soviet agents who held posts in both governments.', u'Krivitsky told Chambers it was their duty to inform.', u'Chambers agreed to reveal what he knew on the condition of immunity from prosecution.', u"During the meeting, which took place at Berle's home, Woodley Mansion in Washington, Chambers named 18 current and former government employees as spies or Communist sympathizers.", u'Many names mentioned held relatively minor posts or were already under suspicion.', u'Some names, however, were more significant and surprising: Alger Hiss, his brother Donald Hiss, and Laurence Duggan\u2014who were all respected, mid-level officials in the State Department\u2014and Lauchlin Currie, a special assistant to Franklin Roosevelt.', u'Another person named had worked on a top secret bombsight project at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds.', u"Berle found Chambers' information tentative, unclear, and uncorroborated.", u'He took the information to the White House, but the President dismissed it, to which Berle made little if any objection.', u"Berle kept his notes, however (later, evidence during Hiss' perjury trials).", u"Berle notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) of Chambers's information in March 1940.", u'In February 1941, Krivitsky was found dead in his hotel room.', u'While police ruled the death a suicide, it was widely speculated that Krivitsky had been killed by Soviet intelligence.', u'Worried that the Soviets might try to kill Chambers too, Berle again told the FBI about his interview with Chambers.', u'Nevertheless, the FBI took no immediate action, in line with the political orientation of the United States, which viewed the potential threat from the USSR as minor, when compared to that of Nazi Germany.', u'(The FBI did interview Chambers in May 1942 and June 1945, without further action.', u"Only in November 1945, when Elizabeth Bentley defected and corroborated much of Chambers's story, did the FBI begin to take Chambers seriously).", u'=== Time Magazine ===\nBy the time of the Berle meeting, Chambers had come out of hiding after a year and joined the staff of Time Magazine (April 1939).', u"He landed a cover story within a month on James Joyce's latest book, Finnegans Wake.", u'He started at the back of the magazine, reviewing books and film with James Agee and then Calvin Fixx.', u"When Fixx died in October 1942, Wilder Hobson succeeded him as Chambers' assistant editor in Arts & Entertainment.", u'Other writers working for Chambers in that section included: novelist Nigel Dennis, future New York Times Book Review editor Harvey Breit, and poets Howard Moss and Weldon Kees.', u"During this time, a struggle arose between those, like Theodore H. White and Richard Lauterbach, who raised criticism of what they saw as the elitism, corruption and ineptitude of Chiang Kai-shek's regime in China and advocated greater cooperation with Mao's Red Army in the struggle against Japanese imperialism, and Chambers and others like Willi Schlamm who adhered to a staunchly pro-Chiang, anti-communist perspective (and who both later joined the founding editorial board of William F. Buckley, Jr.'s National Review).", u'Time founder Henry R. Luce, who grew up in China and was a personal friend of Chiang and his wife, came down squarely on the side of Chambers to the point that White complained that his stories were being censored, and even suppressed in their entirety, and left Time shortly after the war as a result.', u'With Luce\'s blessing, Chambers received a promotion to senior editor in September 1943 and was made a member of Time\'s "Senior Group", which determined editorial policy, in December.', u'By early 1948, Chambers had become one of the best known writer-editors at Time.', u'First had come his scathing commentary "The Ghosts on the Roof" (March 5, 1945) on the Yalta Conference (in which Hiss partook).', u'Subsequent cover-story essays profiled Marian Anderson, Arnold J. Toynbee, Rebecca West and Reinhold Niebuhr.', u"The cover story on Marian Anderson (December 30, 1946) proved so popular that the magazine broke its rule of non-attribution in response to readers' letters:\n\nMost Time cover stories are written and edited by the regular staffs of the section in which they appear.", u'Certain cover stories, that present special difficulties or call for a special literary skill, are written by Senior Editor Whittaker Chambers."', u'Chambers was at the height of his career when the Hiss case broke later that year.', u'During this period, Chambers and his family became Quakers, attending Pipe Creek Friends Meetinghouse near his Maryland farm.', u'== The Hiss case ==\nOn August 3, 1948, Chambers was called to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC).', u'Here he gave the names of individuals he said were part of the underground "Ware group" in the late 1930s, including Alger Hiss.', u'He thus once again named Hiss as a member of the Communist Party, but did not yet make any accusations of espionage.', u'In subsequent HUAC sessions, Hiss testified and initially denied that he knew anyone by the name of Chambers, but on seeing him in person (and after it became clear that Chambers knew details about Hiss\'s life), said that he had known Chambers under the name "George Crosley".', u'Hiss denied that he had ever been a Communist, however.', u'Since Chambers still presented no evidence, the committee had initially been inclined to take the word of Hiss on the matter.', u'However, committee member Richard Nixon received secret information from the FBI which had led him to pursue the issue.', u'When it issued its report, HUAC described Hiss\'s testimony as "vague and evasive".', u'=== "Red Herring" ===\nThe country quickly became divided over the Hiss\u2013Chambers issue.', u'President Harry S Truman, not pleased with the allegation that the man who had presided over the United Nations Charter Conference was a Communist, dismissed the case as a "red herring".', u"In the atmosphere of increasing anti-communism that would later be termed McCarthyism, many conservatives viewed the Hiss case as emblematic of what they saw as Democrats' laxity towards the danger of communist infiltration and influence in the State Department.", u'Many liberals, in turn, saw the Hiss case as part of the desperation of the Republican party to regain the office of president, having been out of power for 16 years.', u'Truman also issued Executive Order 9835, which initiated a program of loyalty reviews for federal employees in 1947.', u'=== "Pumpkin Papers" ===\nHiss filed a $75,000 libel suit against Chambers on October 8, 1948.', u"Under pressure from Hiss's lawyers, Chambers finally retrieved his envelope of evidence and presented it to the HUAC after they subpoenaed them.", u"It contained four notes in Alger Hiss's handwriting, sixty-five typewritten copies of State Department documents and five strips of microfilm, some of which contained photographs of State Department documents.", u'The press came to call these the "Pumpkin Papers" referring to the fact that Chambers had briefly hidden the microfilm in a hollowed-out pumpkin.', u'These documents indicated that Hiss knew Chambers long after mid-1936, when Hiss said he had last seen "Crosley," and also that Hiss had engaged in espionage with Chambers.', u'Chambers explained his delay in producing this evidence as an effort to spare an old friend from more trouble than necessary.', u'Until October 1948, Chambers had repeatedly stated that Hiss had not engaged in espionage, even when Chambers testified under oath.', u'Chambers was forced to testify at the Hiss trials that he had committed perjury several times, which reduced his credibility in the eyes of his critics.', u'The five rolls of 35 mm film known as the "pumpkin papers" were thought until late 1974 to be locked in HUAC files.', u'Independent researcher Stephen W. Salant, an economist at the University of Michigan, sued the U.S. Justice Department in 1975 when his request for access to them under the Freedom of Information Act was denied.', u'On July 31, 1975, as a result of this lawsuit and follow-on suits filed by Peter Irons and by Alger Hiss and William Reuben, the Justice Department released copies of the "pumpkin papers" that had been used to implicate Hiss.', u'One roll of film turned out to be totally blank due to overexposure, two others are faintly legible copies of nonclassified Navy Department documents relating to such subjects as life rafts and fire extinguishers, and the remaining two are photographs of the State Department documents introduced by the prosecution at the two Hiss trials, relating to U.S./German relations in the late 1930s.', u'This story, however, as reported by the NY Times in the 1970s, contains only a partial truth.', u'The blank roll had been mentioned by Chambers in his autobiography Witness.', u'But in addition to innocuous farm reports, etc., the documents on the other pumpkin patch microfilms also included "confidential memos sent from overseas embassies to diplomatic staff in Washington, D.C."; worse, those memos had originally been transmitted in code, which, thanks to their (presumably) having both coded originals and the translations forwarded by Hiss, the Soviets now could easily understand.', u'=== Perjury ===\nHiss could not be tried for espionage at this time, because the evidence indicated the offense had occurred more than ten years prior to that time, and the statute of limitations for espionage was five years.', u'Instead, Hiss was indicted for two counts of perjury relating to testimony he had given before a federal grand jury the previous December.', u'There he had denied giving any documents to Whittaker Chambers, and testified he had not seen Chambers after mid-1936.', u'Hiss was tried twice for perjury.', u'The first trial, in June 1949, ended with the jury deadlocked eight to four for conviction.', u"In addition to Chambers's testimony, a government expert testified that other papers typed on a typewriter belonging to the Hiss family matched the secret papers produced by Chambers.", u'An impressive array of character witnesses appeared on behalf of Hiss: two U.S. Supreme Court justices, Felix Frankfurter and Stanley Reed, former Democratic presidential nominee John W. Davis and future Democratic presidential nominee Adlai Stevenson.', u'Chambers, on the other hand, was attacked by Hiss\'s attorneys as "an enemy of the Republic, a blasphemer of Christ, a disbeliever in God, with no respect for matrimony or motherhood".', u'In the second trial, Hiss\'s defense produced a psychiatrist who characterized Chambers as a "psychopathic personality" and "a pathological liar".', u'The second trial ended in January 1950 with Hiss found guilty on both counts of perjury.', u'He was sentenced to five years in prison.', u'== After the Hiss case ==\nChambers had resigned from Time in December 1948.', u'After the Hiss Case, he wrote a few articles for Fortune, Life, and Look magazines.', u"=== Witness ===\nIn 1952, Chambers's book Witness was published to widespread acclaim.", u'The book was a combination of autobiography and a warning about the dangers of Communism.', u'Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. called it "a powerful book".', u'Ronald Reagan credited the book as the inspiration behind his conversion from a New Deal Democrat to a conservative Republican.', u'Witness was a bestseller for more than a year and helped pay off Chambers\' legal debts, though bills lingered ("as Odysseus was beset by a ghost").', u'=== National Review ===\nIn 1955, William F.

Johnson was part of a coup d'\xe9tat to kill Kennedy.", u'After a slow start at the box office, the film gradually picked up momentum, earning over $205 million in worldwide gross.', u'JFK was nominated for eight Academy Awards (including Best Picture) and won two for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing.', u'It was the most successful of three films Stone made about the American Presidency, followed later by Nixon with Anthony Hopkins in the title role and W. with Josh Brolin as George W.

edited the book and it was published in 1988.', u'While attending the Latin American Film Festival in Havana, Cuba, Stone met Sheridan Square Press publisher Ellen Ray on an elevator.', u"She had published Jim Garrison's book On the Trail of the Assassins.", u'Ray had gone to New Orleans and worked with Garrison in 1967.', u"She gave Stone a copy of Garrison's book and told him to read it.", u'He did and quickly bought the film rights with $250,000 of his own money to prevent talk going around the studios about projects he might be developing.', u'Kennedy\'s assassination had always had a profound effect on Stone: "The Kennedy murder was one of the signal events of the postwar generation, my generation."', u'Stone met Garrison and grilled him with a variety of questions for three hours.', u"Garrison stood up to Stone's questioning and then got up and left.", u'His pride and dignity impressed the director.', u'Stone\'s impressions from their meeting were that Garrison "made many mistakes.', u'He trusted a lot of weirdos and followed a lot of fake leads.', u'But he went out on a limb, way out.', u'And he kept going, even when he knew he was facing long odds."', u"Stone was not interested in making a film about Garrison's life, but rather the story behind the conspiracy to kill Kennedy.", u"He also bought the film rights to Jim Marrs' book Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy.", u'One of the filmmaker\'s primary goals with JFK was to provide a rebuttal to the Warren Commission\'s report that he believed was "a great myth.', u'And in order to fight a myth, maybe you have to create another one, a counter-myth."', u"Even though Marrs' book collected many theories, Stone was hungry for more and hired Jane Rusconi, a recent Yale University graduate, to lead a team of researchers and assemble as much information about the assassination as possible while the director completed post-production on Born on the Fourth of July.", u'Stone read two dozen books on the assassination while Rusconi read between 100 and 200 books on the subject.', u'By December 1989, Stone began approaching studios to back his film.', u'While in pre-production on The Doors, he met with three executives at Warner Bros. who wanted him to make a film about Howard Hughes.', u'However, Warren Beatty owned the rights and so Stone pitched JFK.', u'Studio president and Chief Operating Officer Terry Semel liked the idea.', u"He had a reputation for making political and controversial films, including All the President's Men, The Parallax View and The Killing Fields.", u'Stone made a handshake deal with Warner Bros. whereby the studio would get all the rights to the film and put up $20 million for the budget.', u"The director did this so that the screenplay wouldn't be widely read and bid on, and he also knew that the material was potentially dangerous and wanted only one studio to finance it.", u"Finally, Stone liked Semel's track record of producing political films.", u'=== Screenplay ===\nWhen Stone set out to write the screenplay, he asked Sklar (who also edited Marrs\' book) to co-write it with him and distill the Garrison and Marrs\' books and Rusconi\'s research into a script that would resemble what he called "a great detective movie."', u"Stone told Sklar his vision of the film:\n\nI see the models as Z and Rashomon, I see the event in Dealey Plaza taking place in the first reel, and again in the eighth reel, and again later, and each time we're going to see it differently and with more illumination.", u'Although he did employ ideas from Rashomon, his principal model for JFK was Z:\n\nSomehow I had the impression that in Z you had the showing of the crime and then the re-showing of the crime throughout the picture until it was seen another way.', u"That was the idea of JFK \u2013 that was the essence of it: basically, that's why I called it JFK.", u'Not J dot F dot K dot.', u'JFK.', u'It was a code, like Z was a code, for he lives, American-style.', u'As it was written it became more fascinating: it evolved into four DNA threads.', u'Stone broke the film\'s structure down into four stories: Garrison investigating the New Orleans connection to the assassination; the research that revealed what Stone calls, "Oswald legend: who he was and how to try to inculcate that"; the recreation of the assassination at Dealey Plaza; and the information that the character of "X" imparts on Garrison, which Stone saw as the "means by which we were able to move between New Orleans, local, into the wider story of Dealey Plaza."', u'Sklar worked on the Garrison side of the story while Stone added the Oswald story, the events at Dealey Plaza and the "Mr. X" character.', u'Sklar spent a year researching and writing a 550 triple-spaced page screenplay and then Stone rewrote it and condensed it closer to normal screenplay length.', u'Stone and Sklar used composite characters, most notably the "Mr. X" character played by Donald Sutherland.', u'This was a technique that would be criticized in the press.', u'He was a mix of Richard Case Nagell and retired Air Force colonel Fletcher Prouty, another adviser for the film and who was a military liaison between the CIA and the Pentagon.', u'Meeting Prouty was, for Stone, "one of the most extraordinary afternoons I\'ve ever spent.', u'Pretty much like in the movie, he just started to talk."', u'According to Stone,\n\nI feel this was in the spirit of the truth because Garrison also met a deep throat type named Richard Case Nagell, who claimed to be a CIA agent and made Jim aware of a much larger scenario than the microcosm of New Orleans.', u"The screenplay's early drafts suggested a four and a half-hour film with a potential budget of $40 million \u2013 double what Stone had agreed to with Warner Bros.", u'The director knew film mogul Arnon Milchan and met with him to help finance the film.', u'Milchan was eager to work on the project and launch his new company, Regency Enterprises, with a high profile film like JFK.', u'Milchan made a deal with Warner Bros. to put up the money for the film.', u'Stone managed to pare down his initial revision, a 190-page draft, to a 156-page shooting script.', u'There were many advisers for the film, including Gerald Hemming, a former Marine who claimed involvement in various CIA activities, and Robert Groden, a self-proclaimed photographic expert and longtime JFK assassination researcher and author.', u"=== Principal photography ===\nThe story revolves around Costner's Jim Garrison, with a large cast of well-known actors in supporting roles.", u'Stone was inspired by the casting model of the documentary epic The Longest Day, which he had admired as a child: "It was realistic, but it had a lot of stars ... the supporting cast provides a map of the American psyche: familiar, comfortable faces that walk you through a winding path in the dark woods."', u'Cinematographer Robert Richardson was a week and a half into shooting City of Hope for John Sayles when he got word that Stone was thinking about making JFK.', u"By the time principal photography wrapped on City of Hope, Richardson was ready to make Stone's film.", u'To prepare, Richardson read up on various JFK assassination books starting with On the Trail of the Assassins and Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy.', u'The original idea was to film the opening sequence in 1.33:1 aspect ratio in order to simulate the TV screens that were available at the time of the assassination, then transition to 1.85:1 when Garrison began his investigation, and finally switch to 2.35:1 for scenes occurring in 1968 and later.', u'However, because of time constraints and logistics, Richardson was forced to abandon this approach.', u'Stone wanted to recreate the Kennedy assassination in Dealey Plaza.', u'His producers had to pay the Dallas City Council a substantial amount of money to hire police to reroute traffic and close streets for three weeks.', u'He only had ten days to shoot all of the footage he needed and so he used seven cameras (two 35 mm and five 16 mm) and 14 film stocks.', u'Getting permission to shoot in the Texas School Book Depository was more difficult.', u'They had to pay $50,000 to put someone in the window from which Oswald was supposed to have shot Kennedy.', u'They were allowed to film in that location only between certain hours with only five people on the floor at one time: the camera crew, an actor and Stone.', u'Co-producer Clayton Townsend has said that the hardest part was getting the permission to restore the building to the way it looked back in 1963.', u'It took five months of negotiation.', u'The production spent $4 million to restore Dealey Plaza to 1963 conditions.', u'Stone utilized a variety of film stocks.', u'Richardson said, "It depends whether you want to shoot in 35 or 16 or Super 8.', u'In many cases the lighting has to be different."', u'For certain shots in the film, Stone employed multiple camera crews shooting at once, using five cameras at the same time in different formats.', u'Richardson said of Stone\'s style of direction, "Oliver disdains convention, he tries to force you into things that are not classic.', u'There\'s this constant need to stretch."', u'This forced the cinematographer to use lighting in diverse positions and rely very little on classic lighting modes.', u'The shoot lasted 79 days with filming finished five months before the release date.', u"=== Editing ===\nJFK marked a fundamental change in the way that Stone constructed his films: a subjective lateral presentation of the plot, with the editing's rhythm carrying the story.", u'Stone brought in Hank Corwin, an editor of commercials, to help edit the film.', u'Stone chose him because his "chaotic mind" was "totally alien to the film form."', u'Stone remembers that Corwin irritated the more traditional editors working on the film because his "concepts are very commercial sixty-seconds-get-your-attention-fragment-your-mind-make-you-rethink-it.', u'But he had not developed the long form yet.', u'And so a lot of his cuts were very chaotic."', u'Stone employed extensive use of flashbacks within flashbacks for a specific effect.', u"He said in an interview,\n\nI wanted to do the film on two or three levels \u2013 sound and picture would take us back, and we'd go from one flashback to another, and then that flashback would go inside another flashback ...", u'I wanted multiple layers because reading the Warren Commission Report is like drowning.', u'Partially due to a setback that occurred during editing, that saw all the time codes disappear, JFK would be the last film that Stone edited on film stock before he switched to digital editing.', u'Years after its release, Stone said of the film that it "was the beginning of a new era for me in terms of film making because it\'s not just about a conspiracy to kill John Kennedy.', u"It's also about the way we look at our recent history ...", u'It shifts from black and white to color, and then back again, and views people from offbeat angles."', u"=== Music ===\n\nBecause of his enormous commitment to Steven Spielberg's Hook, which opened the same month as JFK, composer John Williams did not have time to compose a conventional score for the entire film.", u'Instead he composed and conducted six musical sequences in full for JFK before he saw the film in its entirety.', u"Soon after recording this music, he traveled to New Orleans where Stone was still shooting the film and saw approximately an hour's worth of edited footage and dailies.", u'Williams remembers, "I thought his handling of Lee Harvey Oswald was particularly strong, and I understood some of the atmosphere of the film \u2013 the sordid elements, the underside of New Orleans."', u"Stone and his team then actually cut the film to fit Williams' music after the composer had scored and recorded musical cues in addition to the six he had done prior to seeing the film.", u'For the motorcade sequence, Williams described the score he composed as "strongly kinetic music, music of interlocking rhythmic disciplines."', u"The composer remembered the moment he learned of Kennedy's assassination and it stuck with him for years.", u'This was a significant factor in his deciding to work on the film.', u'Williams said, "This is a very resonant subject for people of my generation, and that\'s why I welcomed the opportunity to participate in this film."', u'== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical reaction ===\nBased on 55 reviews collected from notable publications by popular review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 84% "fresh" approval rating, with the consensus, "As history, Oliver Stone\'s JFK is dubious, but as filmmaking it\'s electric, cramming a ton of information and excitement into its three-hour runtime and making great use of its outstanding cast."', u"However, the film's production and release was subject to intense scrutiny and criticism.", u'A few weeks after shooting had begun, on May 14, 1991, Jon Margolis wrote in the Chicago Tribune that JFK was "an insult to the intelligence."', u'Five days later, the Washington Post ran a scathing article by national security correspondent George Lardner titled, "On the Set: Dallas in Wonderland" that used the first draft of the JFK screenplay to blast it for "the absurdities and palpable untruths in Garrison\'s book and Stone\'s rendition of it."', u"The article pointed out that Garrison lost his case against Clay Shaw and that he inflated his case by trying to use Shaw's homosexual relationships to prove guilt by association.", u"Stone responded to Lardner's article by hiring a public relations firm that specialized in political issues.", u'Other critical articles soon followed.', u'Anthony Lewis in the New York Times stated that the film "tells us that our government cannot be trusted to give an honest account of a Presidential assassination."', u'Washington Post columnist George Will called Stone "a man of technical skill, scant education and negligible conscience."', u"TIME magazine ran its own critique of the film-in-progress on June 10, 1991 and alleged that Stone was trying to suppress a rival JFK assassination film based on Don DeLillo's 1988 novel Libra.", u'Stone rebutted these claims in a letter to the magazine.', u"Richard Corliss, TIME's film critic, wrote later on (Dec. 23, 1991): So, you want to know, who killed the President and connived in the cover-up?", u'Everybody!', u'High officials in the CIA, the FBI, the Dallas constabulary, all three armed services, Big Business and the White House.', u'Everybody done it\u2014everybody but Lee Harvey Oswald.', u"Yet on the movie itself: Whatever one's suspicions about its use or abuse of the evidence, JFK is a knockout.", u"Part history book, part comic book, the movie rushes toward judgment for three breathless hours, lassoing facts and factoids by the thousands, then bundling them together into an incendiary device that would frag any viewer's complacency.", u"Stone's picture is, in both meanings of the word, sensational: it's tip-top tabloid journalism.", u'In its bravura and breadth, JFK is seditiously enthralling; in its craft, wondrously complex.', u'The filmmaker ended up splitting his time between making his film, responding to criticism, and conducting a publicity campaign of his own that saw him "omnipresent, from CBS Evening News, to Oprah."', u'However, the Lardner Post piece stung the most because Lardner had stolen a copy of the script.', u'Stone recalls, "He had the first draft, and I went through probably six or seven drafts."', u'Upon theatrical release, it polarized critics.', u'The New York Times ran an article by Bernard Weinraub entitled, "Hollywood Wonders If Warner Brothers let JFK Go Too Far."', u'The article called for intervention by the studio, asking "At what point does a studio exercise its leverage and blunt the highly charged message of a film maker like Oliver Stone?"', u'The newspaper also ran a review of the film by Vincent Canby who wrote, "Mr. Stone\'s hyperbolic style of film making is familiar: lots of short, often hysterical scenes tumbling one after another, backed by a soundtrack that is layered, strudel-like, with noises, dialogue, music, more noises, more dialogue."', u'Pat Dowell, veteran film critic for The Washingtonian, had her 34-word capsule review for the January issue rejected by her editor John Limpert on the grounds that he didn\'t want a positive review for a film he felt was "preposterous" associated with the magazine.', u'Dowell resigned in protest.', u'The Miami Herald said about the controversy in its review, "the focus on the trivialities of personality conveniently prevents us from having to confront the tough questions [Stone\'s] film raises."', u'However, Roger Ebert praised the film in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, saying,\n\nThe achievement of the film is not that it answers the mystery of the Kennedy assassination, because it does not, or even that it vindicates Garrison, who is seen here as a man often whistling in the dark.', u'Its achievement is that it tries to marshal the anger which ever since 1963 has been gnawing away on some dark shelf of the national psyche.', u"Rita Kempley in the Washington Post wrote,\n\nQuoting everyone from Shakespeare to Hitler to bolster their arguments, Stone and Sklar present a gripping alternative to the Warren Commission's conclusion.", u'A marvelously paranoid thriller featuring a closetful of spies, moles, pro-commies and Cuban freedom-fighters, the whole thing might have been thought up by Robert Ludlum.', u'On Christmas Day, the Los Angeles Times ran a critical article entitled "Suppression of the Facts Grants Stone a Broad Brush."', u'New York Newsday followed suit the next day with two articles \u2013 "The Blurred Vision of JFK" and "The Many Theories of a Jolly Green Giant."', u'A few days later, the Chicago Sun-Times followed suit with "Stone\'s Film Trashes Facts, Dishonors J.F.K."', u"Jack Valenti, then president and chief executive of the Motion Picture Association of America, denounced Stone's film in a seven-page statement.", u'He wrote, "In much the same way, young German boys and girls in 1941 were mesmerized by Leni Riefenstahl\'s Triumph of the Will, in which Adolf Hitler was depicted as a newborn God.', u'Both JFK and Triumph of the Will are equally a propaganda masterpiece and equally a hoax.', u'Mr. Stone and Leni Riefenstahl have another genetic linkage: neither of them carried a disclaimer on their film that its contents were mostly pure fiction."', u'Stone recalls in an interview, "I can\'t even remember all the threats, there were so many of them."', u'TIME magazine ranked it the fourth best film of 1991, while including it in Top 10 Historically Misleading Films.', u"Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times went on to name Stone's film as the best film of the year and one of the top ten films of the decade, as well as one of The Great Movies.", u'The Sydney Morning Herald named JFK as the best film of 1991.', u'Entertainment Weekly ranked it the 5th Most Controversial Movie Ever.', u'Ebert\'s colleague Richard Roeper was less complimentary: "One can admire Stone\'s filmmaking skills and the performances here while denouncing the utter crapola presented as \'evidence\' of a conspiracy to murder."', u'Roeper applauded the film\'s "dazzling array of filmmaking techniques and a stellar roster of actors" but criticized Stone\'s narrative: "As a work of fantastical fiction, JFK is an interesting if overblown vision of a parallel universe.', u'As a dramatic interpretation of events, it\'s journalistically bankrupt nonsense."', u'Harry Connick Sr., the New Orleans district attorney who defeated Garrison in 1973, criticized Stone\'s view of the assassination: "Stone was either unaware of the details and particulars of the Clay Shaw investigation and trial or, if he was aware, that didn\'t get in his way of what he perceived to be the way the case should have been."', u"In his book Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, a history of the assassination published 16 years after the film's release, Vincent Bugliosi devoted an entire chapter to Garrison's prosecution of Shaw and Stone's subsequent film.", u'Bugliosi lists thirty-two separate "lies and fabrications" in Stone\'s film and describes the film as "one continuous lie in which Stone couldn\'t find any level of deception and invention beyond which he was unwilling to go."', u'David Wrone stated that "80 percent of the film is in factual error" and rejected the premise of a conspiracy involving the CIA and the so-called military-industrial complex as "irrational."', u'Warren Commission investigator David Belin called the film "a big lie that would make Adolf Hitler proud".', u'=== Box office ===\nJFK was released in theaters on December 20, 1991.', u'Box office started slow but picked up momentum and by the first week in January 1992, it had grossed over $50 million worldwide.', u'Stone started to get support for his film.', u"Warner Brothers executives pointed out that because of the film's long running time, it had fewer screenings.", u"The studio undertook a $15 million marketing campaign promoting Stone's film.", u'On its first week of release, JFK tied with Beauty and the Beast for fifth place in the U.S. box office and its critics began to say it was a flop.', u'However, JFK eventually earned over $200 million worldwide, and $70 million in the United States during its initial run.', u'Garrison\'s estate subsequently sued Warner Bros. for a share of the film\'s profits, alleging a book-keeping practice known as "Hollywood accounting."', u'The lawsuit contends that JFK made in excess of $150 million worldwide but the studio claimed that the film did not earn any money under its "net profits" accounting formula.', u"The suit also claims that Garrison's estate didn't receive any of the net profits income.", u'He should have been paid more than $1 million.', u'=== Awards and nominations ===\nJFK was nominated for eight Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Tommy Lee Jones), Best Director (Oliver Stone), Best Original Score (John Williams), Best Sound (Michael Minkler, Gregg Landaker and Tod A. Maitland), Best Cinematography (Robert Richardson), Best Film Editing, and Best Adapted Screenplay (Stone and Zachary Sklar).', u'It won two awards, for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing.', u"Stone was nominated for an award for Outstanding Directing by the Directors Guild of America but didn't win.", u'He also won a Golden Globe for Best Director and in his acceptance speech, he said, "A terrible lie was told to us 28 years ago.', u'I hope that this film can be the first step in righting that wrong."', u'Entertainment Weekly ranked JFK as one of the 25 "Powerful Political Thrillers".', u'=== Cultural impact ===\nIn 1992, the television show Seinfeld pastiched the "Magic Bullet Theory" featured in JFK in an episode ("The Boyfriend") wherein Kramer and Newman believe that they had been spat at by New York Met Keith Hernandez, who later reveals that there had been a second spitter, Roger McDowell.', u"Wayne Knight, who plays Newman, is also in JFK as a member of Garrison's team.", u'He would be one of the two men to model the shooting in court to prove the implausibility of the "magic bullet," not unlike how Jerry disproves Newman and Kramer\'s theory of the "magic loogie."', u'In each case, Knight played the second victim in the sequence, John Connally and Newman, respectively.', u'== Legislative impact ==\n\nThe final report of the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) partially credited concern over the conclusions in JFK with the passage of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, also known as the JFK Act.', u'The ARRB stated that the film "popularized a version of President Kennedy\'s assassination that featured U.S. government agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the military as conspirators."', u'While describing the film as "largely fictional", the ARRB acknowledged Stone\'s point that official records were to be sealed from the public until 2029, and his suggestion that "Americans could not trust official public conclusions when those conclusions had been made in secret."', u'By ARRB law, all existing assassination-related documents will be made public by 2017.', u'== Home video ==\nJFK has been released on VHS, LaserDisc, and several times on DVD.', u'The film\'s only version ever released on DVD and Blu-ray in the United States is the 206-minute "Director\'s Cut".', u'The theatrical cut has been released on DVD in only a few foreign territories, including the UK.', u'In 2001, the "Director\'s Cut" was released as part of the Oliver Stone Collection box set with the film on one disc and supplemental material on the second.', u"Stone contributed several extras to this edition, including an audio commentary, two multimedia essays, and 54 minutes' worth of deleted/extended scenes with optional commentary by Stone.", u'In 2003, a two-DVD "Special Edition" was released with all of the extras on the 2001 edition in addition to a 90-minute documentary entitled, Beyond JFK: The Question of Conspiracy.', u'The film was released on Blu-ray on November 11, 2008.', u'The disc features many of the extras included on the previous DVD releases, including the Beyond JFK: The Question of Conspiracy documentary.', u'== See also ==\n\nLBJ (film)\nPseudo-documentary\nCultural depictions of John F.

{'sentences': [u'Alabama (/\u02cc\xe6l\u0259\u02c8b\xe6m\u0259/) is a state in the southeastern region of the United States.', u'It is bordered by Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west.', u'Alabama is the 30th-most extensive and the 24th-most populous of the U.S. states.', u"At 1,300 miles (2,100 km), Alabama has one of the nation's longest navigable inland waterways.", u'From the American Civil War until World War II, Alabama, like many states in the southern U.S., suffered economic hardship, in part because of continued dependence on agriculture.', u'Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, white rural interests dominated the state legislature from 1901 to the 1960s, as it did not regularly reapportion the legislature from 1901 to 1961; urban interests and African Americans were markedly under-represented.', u'African Americans and poor whites were essentially disenfranchised altogether by the state constitution of 1901, a status that continued into the mid-1960s before being alleviated by federal legislation.', u'Exclusion of minorities continued under at-large voting systems in most counties; some changes were made through a series of omnibus court cases in the late 1980s to establish different electoral systems.', u"Following World War II, Alabama experienced growth as the state's economy changed from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests.", u'The power of the Solid South in Congress gained the establishment or expansion of multiple United States Armed Forces installations, which helped bridge the gap between an agricultural and industrial economy during the mid-20th century.', u'The state economy in the 21st century is based on management, automotive, finance, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.', u'Alabama is nicknamed the Yellowhammer State, after the state bird.', u'Alabama is also known as the "Heart of Dixie" and the Cotton State.', u'The state tree is the longleaf pine, and the state flower is the camellia.', u"Alabama's capital is Montgomery.", u'The largest city by population is Birmingham, which has long been the most industrialized city, and largest city by land area is Huntsville.', u'The oldest city is Mobile, founded by French colonists in 1702 as the capital of French Louisiana.', u'== Etymology ==\n\nThe European-American naming of the Alabama River and state originates from the Alabama people, a Muskogean-speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river.', u'In the Alabama language, the word for a person of Alabama lineage is Albaamo (or variously Albaama or Alb\xe0amo in different dialects; the plural form is Albaamaha).', u'The word Alabama is believed to have come from the Alabama language and a suggestion the name was borrowed from the Choctaw language is unlikely.', u"The word's spelling varies significantly among historical sources.", u'The first usage appears in three accounts of the Hernando de Soto expedition of 1540 with Garcilaso de la Vega using Alibamo, while the Knight of Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel wrote Alibamu and Limamu, respectively, in efforts to transliterate the term.', u'As early as 1702, the French called the tribe the Alibamon, with French maps identifying the river as Rivi\xe8re des Alibamons.', u'Other spellings of the appellation have included Alibamu, Alabamo, Albama, Alebamon, Alibama, Alibamou, Alabamu, Allibamou.', u"Sources disagree on the word's meaning.", u'Some scholars suggest the word comes from the Choctaw alba (meaning "plants" or "weeds") and amo (meaning "to cut", "to trim", or "to gather").', u'The meaning may have been "clearers of the thicket" or "herb gatherers", referring to clearing land for cultivation or collecting medicinal plants.', u'The state has numerous place names of Native American origin.', u'However, there are no correspondingly similar words in the Alabama language.', u'An 1842 article in the Jacksonville Republican proposed it meant "Here We Rest."', u'This notion was popularized in the 1850s through the writings of Alexander Beaufort Meek.', u'Experts in the Muskogean languages have been unable to find evidence to support such a translation.', u'And, thus, this is probably erroneous.', u'== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-European settlement ===\n\nIndigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before European colonization.', u'Trade with the northeastern tribes by the Ohio River began during the Burial Mound Period (1000 BC\u2013AD 700) and continued until European contact.', u'The agrarian Mississippian culture covered most of the state from 1000 to 1600 AD, with one of its major centers built at what is now the Moundville Archaeological Site in Moundville, Alabama.', u'This is the second-largest complex of the classic Middle Mississippian era, after Cahokia in present-day Illinois, which was the center of the culture.', u"Analysis of artifacts from archaeological excavations at Moundville were the basis of scholars' formulating the characteristics of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (SECC).", u'Contrary to popular belief, the SECC appears to have no direct links to Mesoamerican culture, but developed independently.', u'The Ceremonial Complex represents a major component of the religion of the Mississippian peoples; it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood.', u'Among the historical tribes of Native American people living in present-day Alabama at the time of European contact were the Cherokee, an Iroquoian language people; and the Muskogean-speaking Alabama (Alibamu), Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Koasati.', u'While part of the same large language family, the Muskogee tribes developed distinct cultures and languages.', u'=== European settlement ===\nWith exploration in the 16th century, the Spanish were the first Europeans to reach Alabama.', u'The expedition of Hernando de Soto passed through Mabila and other parts of the state in 1540.', u"More than 160 years later, the French founded the region's first European settlement at Old Mobile in 1702.", u'The city was moved to the current site of Mobile in 1711.', u'This area was claimed by the French from 1702 to 1763 as part of La Louisiane.', u"After the French lost to the British in the Seven Years' War, it became part of British West Florida from 1763 to 1783.", u'After the United States victory in the American Revolutionary War, the territory was divided between the United States and Spain.', u'The latter retained control of this western territory from 1783 until the surrender of the Spanish garrison at Mobile to U.S. forces on April 13, 1813.', u'Thomas Bassett, a loyalist to the British monarchy during the Revolutionary era, was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside Mobile.', u'He settled in the Tombigbee District during the early 1770s.', u"The district's boundaries were roughly limited to the area within a few miles of the Tombigbee River and included portions of what is today southern Clarke County, northernmost Mobile County, and most of Washington County.", u'What is now the counties of Baldwin and Mobile became part of Spanish West Florida in 1783, part of the independent Republic of West Florida in 1810, and was finally added to the Mississippi Territory in 1812.', u'Most of what is now the northern two-thirds of Alabama was known as the Yazoo lands beginning during the British colonial period.', u'It was claimed by the Province of Georgia from 1767 onwards.', u'Following the Revolutionary War, it remained a part of Georgia, although heavily disputed.', u'With the exception of the area around Mobile and the Yazoo lands, what is now the lower one-third Alabama was made part of the Mississippi Territory when it was organized in 1798.', u'The Yazoo lands were added to the territory in 1804, following the Yazoo land scandal.', u'Spain kept a claim on its former Spanish West Florida territory in what would become the coastal counties until the Adams\u2013On\xeds Treaty officially ceded it to the United States in 1819.', u'=== 19th century ===\nBefore the admission of Mississippi as a state on December 10, 1817, the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the Alabama Territory.', u'The Alabama Territory was created by the United States Congress on March 3, 1817.', u'St. Stephens, now abandoned, served as the territorial capital from 1817 to 1819.', u'The U.S. Congress selected Huntsville as the site for the first Constitutional Convention of Alabama after it was approved to become the 22nd state.', u'From July 5 to August 2, 1819, delegates met to prepare the new state constitution.', u"Huntsville served as Alabama's temporary capital from 1819 to 1820, when the seat of state government was moved to Cahaba in Dallas County.", u'Cahaba, now a ghost town, was the first permanent state capital from 1820 to 1825.', u'Alabama Fever was underway when the state was admitted to the Union, with settlers and land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation.', u'Part of the frontier in the 1820s and 1830s, its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men.', u'Southeastern planters and traders from the Upper South brought slaves with them as the cotton plantations in Alabama expanded.', u"The economy of the central Black Belt (named for its dark, productive soil) was built around large cotton plantations whose owners' wealth grew largely from slave labor.", u'The area also drew many poor, disfranchised people who became subsistence farmers.', u'Alabama had an estimated population of under 10,000 people in 1810, but it increased to more than 300,000 people by 1830.', u'Most Native American tribes were completely removed from the state within a few years of the passage of the Indian Removal Act by Congress in 1830.', u"From 1826 to 1846, Tuscaloosa served as Alabama's capital.", u'On January 30, 1846, the Alabama legislature announced it had voted to move the capital city from Tuscaloosa to Montgomery.', u'The first legislative session in the new capital met in December 1847.', u'A new capitol building was erected under the direction of Stephen Decatur Button of Philadelphia.', u'The first structure burned down in 1849, but was rebuilt on the same site in 1851.', u'This second capitol building in Montgomery remains to the present day.', u'It was designed by Barachias Holt of Exeter, Maine.', u'By 1860, the population had increased to 964,201 people, of which nearly half, 435,080, were enslaved African Americans, and 2,690 were free people of color.', u'On January 11, 1861, Alabama declared its secession from the Union.', u'After remaining an independent republic for a few days, it joined the Confederate States of America.', u"The Confederacy's capital was initially at Montgomery.", u'Alabama was heavily involved in the American Civil War.', u'Although comparatively few battles were fought in the state, Alabama contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the war effort.', u"A company of cavalry soldiers from Huntsville, Alabama joined Nathan Bedford Forrest's battalion in Hopkinsville, Kentucky.", u'The company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves, collar and coat tails.', u'This led to them being greeted with "Yellowhammer", and the name later was applied to all Alabama troops in the Confederate Army.', u"Alabama's slaves were freed by the 13th Amendment in 1865.", u'Alabama was under military rule from the end of the war in May 1865 until its official restoration to the Union in 1868.', u'From 1867 to 1874, with most white citizens barred temporarily from voting and freedmen enfranchised, many African Americans emerged as political leaders in the state.', u'Alabama was represented in Congress during this period by three African-American congressmen: Jeremiah Haralson, Benjamin S. Turner, and James T. Rapier.', u'Following the war, the state remained chiefly agricultural, with an economy tied to cotton.', u"During Reconstruction, state legislators ratified a new state constitution in 1868 that created the state's first public school system and expanded women's rights.", u'Legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects, although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation.', u'Organized insurgent, resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and Republicans.', u'Besides the short-lived original Ku Klux Klan, these included the Pale Faces, Knights of the White Camellia, Red Shirts, and the White League.', u"Reconstruction in Alabama ended in 1874, when the Democrats regained control of the legislature and governor's office through an election dominated by fraud and violence.", u'They wrote another constitution in 1875, and the legislature passed the Blaine Amendment, prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious-affiliated schools.', u'The same year, legislation was approved that called for racially segregated schools.', u'Railroad passenger cars were segregated in 1891.', u'After disfranchising most African Americans and many poor whites in the 1901 constitution, the Alabama legislature passed more Jim Crow laws at the beginning of the 20th century to impose segregation in everyday life.', u'=== 20th century ===\n\nThe new 1901 Constitution of Alabama included provisions for voter registration that effectively disenfranchised large portions of the population, including nearly all African Americans and Native Americans, and tens of thousands of poor whites, through making voter registration difficult, requiring a poll taxes and literacy test.', u'By 1903, only 2,980 African Americans were registered in Alabama, although at least 74,000 were literate.', u'This compared to more than 181,000 African Americans eligible to vote in 1900.', u'The numbers dropped even more in later decades.', u'While the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting, the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well, due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax.', u'By 1941, whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws: 600,000 Whites vs. 520,000 African-Americans.', u'Nearly all African Americans had lost the ability to vote.', u'Despite numerous legal challenges that succeeded in overturning certain provisions, the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement.', u'The exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the 1965 to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens.', u'The 1901 constitution required racial segregation of public schools.', u'It also restated that interracial marriage was illegal, as it had been prohibited in 1867.', u'Into the 1950s, the state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities: jails were segregated in 1911; hospitals in 1915; toilets, hotels, and restaurants in 1928; and bus stop waiting rooms in 1945.', u'The rural-dominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised African Americans, but it did not relieve them of paying taxes.', u'Partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for African Americans in the South, the Rosenwald Fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as Rosenwald Schools.', u'In Alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with Rosenwald funds, which paid one-third of the construction costs.', u'The fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest.', u'Black residents effectively taxed themselves twice, by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools, which were built in many rural areas.', u'They often donated land and labor as well.', u'Beginning in 1913, the first 80 Rosenwald Schools were built in Alabama for African-American children.', u"A total of 387 schools, seven teachers' houses, and several vocational buildings were completed by 1937 in the state.", u'Several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.', u'Continued racial discrimination and lynchings, agricultural depression, and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans from rural Alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the 20th century as part of the Great Migration out of the South.', u'Reflecting this emigration, the population growth rate in Alabama (see "Historical Populations" table below) dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920.', u'At the same time, many rural people, both White and African American, migrated to the city of Birmingham to work in new industrial jobs.', u'Birmingham experienced such rapid growth that it was called the "Magic City".', u"By the 1920s, Birmingham was the 19th-largest city in the United States and had more than 30% of the state's population.", u'Heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy.', u'Its residents were under-represented for decades in the state legislature, which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes, as it was required by the state constitution.', u'This did not change until the late 1960s following a lawsuit and court order.', u'Beginning in the 1940s, when the courts started taking the first steps to recognize the voting rights of black voters, the Alabama legislature took several counter -steps designed to disfranchise black voters.', u'The legislature passed, and the voters ratified [as these were mostly white voters], a state constitutional amendment that gave local registrars greater latitude to disqualify voter registration applicants.', u'Black citizens in Mobile successfully challenged this amendment as a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment.', u'The legislature also changed the boundaries of Tuskegee to a 28-sided figure designed to fence out blacks from the city limits.', u'The Supreme Court unanimously held that this racial "gerrymandering" violated the Constitution.', u'In 1961, ... the Alabama legislature also intentionally diluted the effect of the black vote by instituting numbered place requirements for local elections.', u'Industrial development related to the demands of World War II brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the Civil War.', u'Rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living.', u'One example of this massive influx of workers occurred in Mobile.', u'Between 1940 and 1943, more than 89,000 people moved into the city to work for war-related industries.', u'Cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base.', u'Despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population, as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses.', u'They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas.', u'In addition, the state legislature gerrymandered the few Birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside Birmingham.', u"One result was that Jefferson County, containing Birmingham's industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services.", u'Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature.', u'A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, "a minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature."', u"A class action suit initiated on behalf of plaintiffs in Lowndes County, Alabama challenged the state legislature's lack of redistricting for congressional seats.", u'In 1962 White v. Crook, Judge Frank M. Johnson ordered the state to redistrict.', u'United States Supreme Court cases of Baker v. Carr (1962) and Reynolds v. Sims (1964) ruled that the principle of "one man, one vote" needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures as well, and that their districts had to be based on population, rather than geographic counties, as Alabama had used for its senate.', u'In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature completed the first congressional redistricting based on the decennial census.', u'This benefited the urban areas that had developed, as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than 60 years.', u'Other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts.', u'African Americans continued to press in the 1950s and 1960s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the Civil Rights Movement, including legal challenges.', u'In 1954, the US Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that public schools had to be desegregated, but Alabama was slow to comply.', u'During the 1960s, under Governor George Wallace, Alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation.', u'The Civil Rights Movement had notable events in Alabama, including the Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955\u201356), Freedom Rides in 1961, and 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches.', u'These contributed to Congressional passage and enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 by the U.S. Congress.', u'Legal segregation ended in the states in 1964, but Jim Crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court.', u'Despite recommendations of a 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission, the state legislature did not approve an amendment to establish home rule for counties.', u'There is very limited home rule, but the legislature is deeply involved in passing legislation that applies to county-level functions and policies.', u'This both deprives local residents of the ability to govern themselves and distracts the legislature from statewide issues.', u'Alabama has made some changes since the late 20th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation.', u'In the 1980s, an omnibus redistricting case, Dillard v. Crenshaw County, challenged the at-large voting for representative seats of 180 Alabama jurisdictions, including counties and school boards.', u'At-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats.', u'Despite African Americans making up a significant minority in the state, they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions.', u'As part of settlement of this case, five Alabama cites and counties, including Chilton County, adopted a system of cumulative voting for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions.', u'This has resulted in more proportional representation for voters.', u'In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in Conecuh County.', u'In 1982, limited voting was first tested in Conecuh County.', u'Together use of these systems has increased the number of African Americans and women being elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens.', u'== Geography ==\n\nAlabama is the thirtieth-largest state in the United States with 52,419 square miles (135,760 km2) of total area: 3.2% of the area is water, making Alabama 23rd in the amount of surface water, also giving it the second-largest inland waterway system in the U.S. About three-fifths of the land area is a gentle plain with a general descent towards the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico.', u'The North Alabama region is mostly mountainous, with the Tennessee River cutting a large valley and creating numerous creeks, streams, rivers, mountains, and lakes.', u'Alabama is bordered by the states of Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida to the south, and Mississippi to the west.', u'Alabama has coastline at the Gulf of Mexico, in the extreme southern edge of the state.', u'The state ranges in elevation from sea level at Mobile Bay to over 1,800 feet (550 m) in the Appalachian Mountains in the northeast.', u'The highest point is Mount Cheaha, at a height of 2,413 ft (735 m).', u"Alabama's land consists of 22 million acres (89,000 km2) of forest or 67% of total land area.", u'Suburban Baldwin County, along the Gulf Coast, is the largest county in the state in both land area and water area.', u'Areas in Alabama administered by the National Park Service include Horseshoe Bend National Military Park near Alexander City; Little River Canyon National Preserve near Fort Payne; Russell Cave National Monument in Bridgeport; Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site in Tuskegee; and Tuskegee Institute National Historic Site near Tuskegee.', u'Additionally, Alabama has four National Forests: Conecuh, Talladega, Tuskegee, and William B. Bankhead.', u'Alabama also contains the Natchez Trace Parkway, the Selma To Montgomery National Historic Trail, and the Trail Of Tears National Historic Trail.', u'A notable natural wonder in Alabama is "Natural Bridge" rock, the longest natural bridge east of the Rockies, located just south of Haleyville.', u'A 5-mile (8 km)-wide meteorite impact crater is located in Elmore County, just north of Montgomery.', u'This is the Wetumpka crater, the site of "Alabama\'s greatest natural disaster."', u'A 1,000-foot (300 m)-wide meteorite hit the area about 80 million years ago.', u'The hills just east of downtown Wetumpka showcase the eroded remains of the impact crater that was blasted into the bedrock, with the area labeled the Wetumpka crater or astrobleme ("star-wound") because of the concentric rings of fractures and zones of shattered rock that can be found beneath the surface.', u'In 2002, Christian Koeberl with the Institute of Geochemistry University of Vienna published evidence and established the site as the 157th recognized impact crater on Earth.', u'=== Climate ===\n\nThe state is classified as humid subtropical (Cfa) under the Koppen Climate Classification.', u'The average annual temperature is 64 \xb0F (18 \xb0C).', u'Temperatures tend to be warmer in the southern part of the state with its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, while the northern parts of the state, especially in the Appalachian Mountains in the northeast, tend to be slightly cooler.', u'Generally, Alabama has very hot summers and mild winters with copious precipitation throughout the year.', u'Alabama receives an average of 56 inches (1,400 mm) of rainfall annually and enjoys a lengthy growing season of up to 300 days in the southern part of the state.', u'Summers in Alabama are among the hottest in the U.S., with high temperatures averaging over 90 \xb0F (32 \xb0C) throughout the summer in some parts of the state.', u'Alabama is also prone to tropical storms and even hurricanes.', u'Areas of the state far away from the Gulf are not immune to the effects of the storms, which often dump tremendous amounts of rain as they move inland and weaken.', u'South Alabama reports many thunderstorms.', u'The Gulf Coast, around Mobile Bay, averages between 70 and 80 days per year with thunder reported.', u'This activity decreases somewhat further north in the state, but even the far north of the state reports thunder on about 60 days per year.', u'Occasionally, thunderstorms are severe with frequent lightning and large hail;

$8.3 billion providing an estimated 162,000 jobs in the state.', u"Some of the most popular areas include the Rocket City of Huntsville, the beaches along the Gulf, and the state's capitol in Montgomery.", u'=== Healthcare ===\nUAB Hospital is the only Level I trauma center in Alabama.', u'UAB is the largest state government employer in Alabama, with a workforce of about 18,000.', u'=== Banking ===\n\nAlabama has the headquarters of Regions Financial Corporation, BBVA Compass, Superior Bancorp and the former Colonial Bancgroup.', u'Birmingham-based Compass Banchshares was acquired by Spanish-based BBVA in September 2007, although the headquarters of BBVA Compass remains in Birmingham.', u'In November 2006, Regions Financial completed its merger with AmSouth Bancorporation, which was also headquartered in Birmingham.', u'SouthTrust Corporation, another large bank headquartered in Birmingham, was acquired by Wachovia in 2004 for $14.3 billion.', u'The city still has major operations for Wachovia and its now post-operating bank Wells Fargo, which includes a regional headquarters, an operations center campus and a $400 million data center.', u'Nearly a dozen smaller banks are also headquartered in the Birmingham, such as Superior Bancorp, ServisFirst and New South Federal Savings Bank.', u'Birmingham also serves as the headquarters for several large investment management companies, including Harbert Management Corporation.', u'=== Electronics ===\nTelecommunications provider AT&T, formerly BellSouth, has a major presence in Alabama with several large offices in Birmingham.', u'The company has over 6,000 employees and more than 1,200 contract employees.', u'Many commercial technology companies are headquartered in Huntsville, such as the network access company ADTRAN, computer graphics company Intergraph, design and manufacturer of IT infrastructure Avocent, and telecommunications provider Deltacom.', u'Cinram manufactures and distributes 20th Century Fox DVDs and Blu-ray Discs out of their Huntsville plant.', u'=== Construction ===\nRust International has grown to include Brasfield & Gorrie, BE&K, Hoar Construction and B.L.', u'Harbert International, which all routinely are included in the Engineering News-Record lists of top design, international construction, and engineering firms.', u'(Rust International was acquired in 2000 by Washington Group International, which was in turn acquired by San-Francisco based URS Corporation in 2007.)', u"== Law and government ==\n\n\n=== State government ===\n\nThe foundational document for Alabama's government is the Alabama Constitution, which was ratified in 1901.", u"At almost 800 amendments and 310,000 words, it is by some accounts the world's longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the United States Constitution.", u"There has been a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabama's constitution.", u"Critics suggest that Alabama's constitution highly centralizes power in Montgomery and leaves practically no power in local hands.", u'Most counties do not have home rule.', u'Any policy changes proposed around the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum.', u'One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism.', u"Alabama's government is divided into three coequal branches.", u'The legislative branch is the Alabama Legislature, a bicameral assembly composed of the Alabama House of Representatives, with 105 members, and the Alabama Senate, with 35 members.', u'The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation.', u'The Republican Party currently holds a majority in both houses of the Legislature.', u'The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).', u'Until 1964, the state elected state senators by county, with one per county.', u'It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented.', u'It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either.', u'In Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the US Supreme Court implemented the principle of "one man, one vote", ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already had in its constitution but had not implemented.)', u'Further, it ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems.', u'At that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts.', u'This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas.', u'For instance, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of state services in funding.', u'Through the legislative delegations, the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments.', u'The executive branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws.', u'It is headed by the Governor of Alabama.', u'Other members of executive branch include the cabinet, the Attorney General of Alabama, the Alabama Secretary of State, the Alabama State Treasurer, and the State Auditor of Alabama.', u'The current governor of the state is Republican Robert Bentley.', u'The lieutenant governor is Republican Kay Ivey.', u'The judicial branch is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases.', u"The state's highest court is the Supreme Court of Alabama.", u'Alabama uses partisan elections to choose judges, and since the 1980s judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized.', u'The current chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court is Republican Roy Moore.', u'All sitting justices on the Alabama Supreme Court are members of the Republican Party.', u'There are two intermediate appellate courts, the Court of Civil Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals, and four trial courts: the circuit court (trial court of general jurisdiction), and the district, probate, and municipal courts.', u'The members of the Legislature take office immediately after the November elections.', u'Statewide officials such as the governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, and other constitutional officers take office the following January.', u'=== Taxes ===\nAlabama levies a 2, 4, or 5 percent personal income tax, depending upon the amount earned and filing status.', u'Taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their Alabama state tax, and can do so even if taking the standard deduction.', u'Taxpayers who file itemized deductions are also allowed to deduct the Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax (Social Security and Medicare tax).', u"The state's general sales tax rate is 4%.", u'Sales tax rates for cities and counties are also added to purchases.', u'For example, the total sales tax rate in Mobile is 10% and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1%, which means that a diner in Mobile would pay an 11% tax on a meal.', u'As of 1999, sales and excise taxes in Alabama account for 51% of all state and local revenue, compared with an average of about 36% nationwide.', u'Alabama is one of seven states that levy a tax on food at the same rate as other goods, and one of two states (the other being neighboring Mississippi) which fully taxes groceries without any offsetting relief for low-income families.', u'(Most states exempt groceries from sales tax or apply a lower tax rate.)', u"Alabama's income tax on poor working families is among the highest in the United States.", u'Alabama is the only state that levies income tax on a family of four with income as low as $4,600, which is barely one-quarter of the federal poverty line.', u"Alabama's threshold is the lowest among the 41 states and the District of Columbia with income taxes.", u'The corporate income tax rate is currently 6.5%.', u'The overall federal, state, and local tax burden in Alabama ranks the state as the second least tax-burdened state in the country.', u'Property taxes are the lowest in the U.S.', u'The current state constitution requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes.', u"Since Alabama's tax structure largely depends on consumer spending, it is subject to high variable budget structure.", u'For example, in 2003 Alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as $670 million.', u'=== County and local governments ===\n\nAlabama has 67 counties.', u'Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission.', u'It also has limited executive authority in the county.', u'Because of the constraints of the Alabama Constitution, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have limited home rule.', u'Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning.', u'The cumbersome process results in local jurisdictions being unable to manage their problems, and the state legislators are buried in local county issues.', u'The state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission.', u'Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county.', u'United States Supreme Court decisions in Baker v. Carr (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, in order to implement the principle of "one man, one vote".', u'Before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to underrepresentation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties.', u'"The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution.', u"Alabama's constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city.", u'A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance."', u'On November 9, 2011, Jefferson County, which was $4 billion in debt at the time, declared bankruptcy.', u'This is the second-largest Chapter 9 (municipal) bankruptcy in the United States, after the Detroit bankruptcy.', u'Jefferson County emerged from bankruptcy in December 2013 following the approval of a bankruptcy plan by the United States bankruptcy court for the Northern District of Alabama.', u'Alabama is an alcoholic beverage control state, meaning that the state government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol.', u'The Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state.', u'Twenty-five of the 67 counties are "dry counties" which ban the sale of alcohol, and there are many dry municipalities even in counties which permit alcohol sales.', u'=== Politics ===\n\nDuring Reconstruction following the American Civil War, Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the Third Military District under General John Pope.', u'In 1874, the political coalition of white Democrats known as the Redeemers took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the African-American vote through violence, fraud and intimidation.', u'After 1890, a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution.', u'Provisions which disenfranchised African Americans resulted in excluding many poor Whites.', u'By 1941 more Whites than African Americans had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000.', u'The total effects were greater on the African-American community, as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.', u'From 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas.', u'As counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation.', u'Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the Civil Rights Movement, when whites bureaucratically, and at times, violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform.', u"Governor George Wallace, the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation.", u'Only after passage of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights.', u'In many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by at-large electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections.', u'Some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish single-member districts that enable a more diverse representation among county boards.', u'In 2007, the Alabama Legislature passed, and Republican Governor Bob Riley signed a resolution expressing "profound regret" over slavery and its lingering impact.', u'In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the Alabama State Capitol, which housed Congress of the Confederate States of America.', u'In 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years, after a nearly complete realignment of political parties, who represent different visions in the 21st century.', u'=== Elections ===\n\n\n==== State elections ====\nWith the disfranchisement of African Americans in 1901, the state became part of the "Solid South", a system in which the Democratic Party operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state.', u'For nearly 100 years, local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party primary, with generally only token Republican challengers running in the General Election.', u'Since the mid to late-20th century, however, there has been a realignment among the two major political parties, and white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party.', u'In Alabama, majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect Republican candidates to federal, state and local office.', u'Members of the nine seats on the Alabama Supreme Court and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office.', u'Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats.', u'In that general election, the then-incumbent Chief Justice of Alabama, Ernest C. Hornsby, refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican Perry O. Hooper, Sr.. Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court.', u'This ultimately led to a collapse of support for Democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles.', u'The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench.', u'In the early 21st century, Republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices.', u'Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the Alabama State Board of Education.', u'In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years.', u'The last remaining statewide Democrat, who served on the Alabama Public Service Commission was defeated in 2012.', u'Only two Republican Lieutenant Governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction, when Republicans generally represented Reconstruction government, including the newly emancipated freedmen who had gained the franchise.', u'The two GOP Lt. Governors were Steve Windom (1999-2003) and the current Lt.', u'Governor, Kay Ivey, who was elected in 2010 and re-elected in 2014.', u'==== Local elections ====\nMany local offices (County Commissioners, Boards of Education, Tax Assessors, Tax Collectors, etc.)', u'in the state are still held by Democrats.', u'Many rural counties have voters who are majority Democrats, resulting in local elections being decided in the Democratic primary.', u'Similarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are majority-Republican and elections are effectively decided in the Republican Primary, although there are exceptions.', u"Alabama's 67 County Sheriffs are elected in partisan, at-large races, and Democrats still retain the narrow majority of those posts.", u'The current split is 35 Democrats, 31 Republicans, and one Independent Fayette.', u'However, most of the Democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties.', u'The majority of Republican sheriffs have been elected in the more urban/suburban and heavily populated counties.', u'As of 2015, the state of Alabama has one female sheriff, in Morgan County, Alabama, and ten African-American sheriffs.', u"==== Federal elections ====\nThe state's two U.S. senators are Jefferson B.", u'Sessions III and Richard C. Shelby, both Republicans.', u'Shelby was originally elected to the Senate as a Democrat in 1986 and re-elected in 1992, but switched parties immediately following the November 1994 general election.', u'In the U.S. House of Representatives, the state is represented by seven members, six of whom are Republicans: (Bradley Byrne, Mike D. Rogers, Robert Aderholt, Morris J. Brooks, Martha Roby, and Gary Palmer) and one Democrat: Terri Sewell.', u'== Education ==\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary education ===\n\nPublic primary and secondary education in Alabama is under the purview of the Alabama State Board of Education as well as local oversight by 67 county school boards and 60 city boards of education.', u'Together, 1,496 individual schools provide education for 744,637 elementary and secondary students.', u'Public school funding is appropriated through the Alabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund.', u'In FY 2006\u20132007, Alabama appropriated $3,775,163,578 for primary and secondary education.', u'That represented an increase of $444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year.', u'In 2007, over 82 percent of schools made adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward student proficiency under the National No Child Left Behind law, using measures determined by the state of Alabama.', u"While Alabama's public education system has improved in recent decades, it lags behind in achievement compared to other states.", u"According to U.S. Census data, Alabama's high school graduation rate\u201475%\u2014is the fourth lowest in the U.S. (after Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi).", u'The largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees.', u"=== Colleges and universities ===\n\nAlabama's programs of higher education include 14 four-year public universities, two-year community colleges, and 17 private, undergraduate and graduate universities.", u'In the state are four medical schools (as of fall 2015) (University of Alabama School of Medicine, University of South Alabama and Alabama College of Osteopathic Medicine and The Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine - Auburn Campus), two veterinary colleges (Auburn University and Tuskegee University), a dental school (University of Alabama School of Dentistry), an optometry college (University of Alabama at Birmingham), two pharmacy schools (Auburn University and Samford University), and five law schools (University of Alabama School of Law, Birmingham School of Law, Cumberland School of Law, Miles Law School, and the Thomas Goode Jones School of Law).', u'Public, post-secondary education in Alabama is overseen by the Alabama Commission on Higher Education and the Alabama Department of Postsecondary Education.', u'Colleges and universities in Alabama offer degree programs from two-year associate degrees to a multitude of doctoral level programs.', u'The largest single campus is the University of Alabama, located in Tuscaloosa, with 33,602 enrolled for fall 2012.', u'Troy University was the largest institution in the state in 2010, with an enrollment of 29,689 students across four Alabama campuses (Troy, Dothan, Montgomery, and Phenix City), as well as sixty learning sites in seventeen other states and eleven other countries.', u'The oldest institutions are the public University of North Alabama in Florence and the Catholic Church-affiliated Spring Hill College in Mobile, both founded in 1830.', u'Accreditation of academic programs is through the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) as well as other subject-focused national and international accreditation agencies such as the Association for Biblical Higher Education (ABHE), the Council on Occupational Education (COE), and the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS).', u'According to the 2011 U.S. News & World Report, Alabama had three universities ranked in the top 100 Public Schools in America (University of Alabama at 31, Auburn University at 36, and University of Alabama at Birmingham at 73).', u'According to the 2012 U.S. News & World Report, Alabama had four tier 1 universities (University of Alabama, Auburn University, University of Alabama at Birmingham and University of Alabama in Huntsville).', u'== Sports ==\n\n\n=== College ===\n\nCollege football is popular in Alabama, particularly the University of Alabama Crimson Tide and Auburn University Tigers, rivals in the Southeastern Conference.', u'In the 2013 season, Alabama averaged over 100,000 fans per game and Auburn averaged over 80,000 fans, both numbers among the top 20 in the nation in average attendance.', u'Bryant-Denny Stadium is the home of the Alabama football team, and has a seating capacity of 101,821, and is the fifth largest stadium in America.', u'Jordan-Hare Stadium is the home field of the Auburn football team and seats up to 87,451.', u'Legion Field is home for the UAB Blazers football program and the Birmingham Bowl.', u'It seats 80,601.', u'Ladd-Peebles Stadium in Mobile is the home of the University of South Alabama football team, and serves as the home of the NCAA Senior Bowl, Dollar General Bowl (formerly GoDaddy.com Bowl), and Alabama-Mississippi All Star Classic;

{'sentences': [u'The Parliament of England was the legislature of the Kingdom of England.', u'In 1066, William of Normandy introduced what, in later centuries, became referred to as a feudal system, by which he sought the advice of a council of tenants-in-chief (a person who held land) and ecclesiastics before making laws.', u'In 1215, the tenants-in-chief secured Magna Carta from King John, which established that the king may not levy or collect any taxes (except the feudal taxes to which they were hitherto accustomed), save with the consent of his royal council, which gradually developed into a parliament.', u'Over the centuries, the English Parliament progressively limited the power of the English monarchy which arguably culminated in the English Civil War and the trial and execution of Charles I in 1649.', u'After the restoration of the monarchy under Charles II, and the subsequent Glorious Revolution of 1688, the supremacy of Parliament was a settled principle and all future English and later British sovereigns were restricted to the role of constitutional monarchs with limited executive authority.', u'The Act of Union 1707 merged the English Parliament with the Parliament of Scotland to form the Parliament of Great Britain.', u'When the Parliament of Ireland was destroyed in 1801, its former members were merged into what was now called the Parliament of the United Kingdom.', u'== History ==\nUnder a monarchical system of government, monarchs usually must consult and seek a measure of acceptance for their policies if they are to enjoy the broad cooperation of their subjects.', u'Early kings of England had no standing army or police, and so depended on the support of powerful subjects.', u'The monarchy had agents in every part of the country.', u'However, under the feudal system that evolved in England following the Norman Conquest of 1066, the laws of the Crown could not have been upheld without the support of the nobility and the clergy.', u'The former had economic and military power bases of their own through major ownership of land and the feudal obligations of their tenants (some of whom held lands on condition of military service).', u'The Church was virtually a law unto itself in this period as it had its own system of religious law courts.', u'In order to seek consultation and consent from the nobility and the senior clergy on major decisions, post-Norman Conquest English monarchs called Great Councils.', u'A typical Great Council would consist of archbishops, bishops, abbots, barons and earls, the pillars of the feudal system.', u'When this system of consultation and consent broke down, it often became impossible for government to function effectively.', u'The most prominent instances of this prior to the reign of Henry III are the disagreements between Thomas Becket and Henry II and between King John and the barons.', u'Becket, who served as Archbishop of Canterbury between 1162 and 1170, was murdered following a long running dispute with Henry II over the jurisdiction of the Church.', u'John, who was king from 1199 to 1216, aroused such hostility from many leading noblemen that they forced him to agree to Magna Carta in 1215.', u"John's refusal to adhere to this charter led to civil war (see First Barons' War).", u'The Great Council evolved into the Parliament of England.', u'The term itself came into use during the early 13th century, deriving from the Latin and French words for discussion and speaking.', u'The word first appears in official documents in the 1230s.', u'As a result of the work by historians G. O. Sayles and H. G. Richardson, it is widely believed that the early parliaments had a judicial as well as a legislative function.', u'During the 13th and 14th centuries, the kings began to call Knights of the Shire to meet when the monarch saw it as necessary.', u'A notable example of this was in 1254 when sheriffs of counties were instructed to send Knights of the Shire to parliament to advise the king on finance.', u'Initially, parliaments were mostly summoned when the king needed to raise money through taxes.', u'Following the Magna Carta this became a convention.', u'This was due in no small part to the fact that King John died in 1216 and was succeeded by his young son Henry III.', u"Leading peers and clergy governed on Henry's behalf until he came of age, giving them a taste for power that they would prove unwilling to relinquish.", u'Among other things, they made sure that Magna Carta would be reaffirmed by the young king.', u'=== Parliament in the reign of Henry III ===\nOnce the minority of Henry III ended and he took full control of the government, leading peers became increasingly concerned with his style of government, specifically his unwillingness to consult them on decisions he took, and his seeming patronisation of his foreign relatives over his native subjects.', u"Henry's support of a disastrous papal invasion of Sicily was the last straw.", u'In 1258, seven leading barons forced Henry to swear to uphold the Provisions of Oxford, superseded, the following year, by the Provisions of Westminster.', u'This effectively abolished the absolutist Anglo-Norman monarchy, giving power to a council of fifteen barons, and providing for a thrice-yearly meeting of parliament to monitor their performance.', u'Parliament assembled six times between June 1258 and April 1262, most notably at Oxford in 1258.', u'The French-born nobleman Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, emerged as the leader of this characteristically English rebellion.', u'In the following years, those supporting Montfort and those supporting the king grew more hostile to each other.', u'Henry obtained a papal bull in 1263 exempting him from his oath and both sides began to raise armies.', u"At the Battle of Lewes on 14 May 1264, Henry was defeated and taken prisoner by Montfort's army.", u'However, many of the peers who had initially supported Montfort began to suspect that he had gone too far with his reforming zeal.', u'His support amongst the nobility rapidly declined.', u'So in 1264, Montfort summoned the first parliament in English history without any prior royal authorisation.', u'The archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls and barons were summoned, as were two knights from each shire and two burgesses from each borough.', u'Knights had been summoned to previous councils, but the representation of the boroughs was unprecedented.', u"This was purely a move to consolidate Montfort's position as the legitimate governor of the kingdom, since he had captured Henry and his son Prince Edward (later Edward I) at the Battle of Lewes.", u'A parliament consisting of representatives of the realm was the logical way for Montfort to establish his authority.', u'In calling this parliament, in a bid to gain popular support, he summoned knights and burgesses from the emerging gentry class, thus turning to his advantage the fact that most of the nobility had abandoned his movement.', u'This parliament was summoned on 14 December 1264.', u'It first met on 20 January 1265 in Westminster Hall and was dissolved on 15 February 1265.', u'It is not certain who actually attended this parliament.', u'Nonetheless, Montfort\'s scheme was formally adopted by Edward I in the so-called "Model Parliament" of 1295.', u'The attendance at parliament of knights and burgesses historically became known as the summoning of "the Commons", a term derived from the Norman French word "commune", literally translated as the "community of the realm".', u"Following Edward's escape from captivity, Montfort was defeated and killed at the Battle of Evesham in 1265.", u"Henry's authority was restored and the Provisions of Oxford were forgotten, but this was nonetheless a turning point in the history of the Parliament of England.", u'Although he was not obliged by statute to do so, Henry summoned the Commons to parliament three times between September 1268 and April 1270.', u'However, this was not a significant turning point in the history of parliamentary democracy.', u'Subsequently, very little is known about how representatives were selected because, at this time, being sent to parliament was not a prestigious undertaking.', u"But Montfort's decision to summon knights of the shires and burgesses to his parliament did mark the irreversible emergence of the landed gentry as a force in politics.", u"From then on, monarchs could not ignore them, which explains Henry's decision to summon the Commons to several of his post-1265 parliaments.", u"Even though many peers who had supported the Provisions of Oxford remained active in English public life throughout Henry's reign, the conditions they had laid down for regular parliaments were largely forgotten, as if to symbolise the historical development of the English Parliament via convention rather than statutes and written constitutions.", u"=== The emergence of parliament as an institution ===\n\nDuring the reign of Edward I, which began in 1272, the role of Parliament in the government of the English kingdom increased due to Edward's determination to unite England, Wales and Scotland under his rule by force.", u"He was also keen to unite his subjects in order to restore his authority and not face rebellion as was his father's fate.", u'Edward therefore encouraged all sectors of society to submit petitions to parliament detailing their grievances in order for them to be resolved.', u"This seemingly gave all of Edward's subjects a potential role in government and this helped Edward assert his authority.", u'Both the Statute of Westminster 1275 and Statute of Westminster 1285, with the assistance of Robert Burnell, codified the existing law in England.', u'As the number of petitions being submitted to parliament increased, they came to be dealt with, and often ignored, more and more by ministers of the Crown so as not to block the passage of government business through parliament.', u'However the emergence of petitioning is significant because it is some of the earliest evidence of parliament being used as a forum to address the general grievances of ordinary people.', u'Submitting a petition to parliament is a tradition that continues to this day in the Parliament of the United Kingdom and in most Commonwealth realms.', u'These developments symbolise the fact that parliament and government were by no means the same thing by this point.', u'If monarchs were going to impose their will on their kingdom, they would have to control parliament rather than be subservient to it.', u"From Edward's reign onwards, the authority of the English Parliament would depend on the strength or weakness of the incumbent monarch.", u'When the king or queen was strong he or she would wield enough influence to pass their legislation through parliament without much trouble.', u'Some strong monarchs even bypassed it completely, although this was not often possible in the case of financial legislation due to the post-Magna Carta convention of parliament granting taxes.', u'When weak monarchs governed, parliament often became the centre of opposition against them.', u'Subsequently, the composition of parliaments in this period varied depending on the decisions that needed to be taken in them.', u'The nobility and senior clergy were always summoned.', u'From 1265 onwards, when the monarch needed to raise money through taxes, it was usual for knights and burgesses to be summoned too.', u'However, when the king was merely seeking advice, he often only summoned the nobility and the clergy, sometimes with and sometimes without the knights of the shires.', u'On some occasions the Commons were summoned and sent home again once the monarch was finished with them, allowing parliament to continue without them.', u'It was not until the mid-14th century that summoning representatives of the shires and the boroughs became the norm for all parliaments.', u'One of the moments that marked the emergence of parliament as a true institution in England was the deposition of Edward II.', u'Even though it is debatable whether Edward II was deposed in parliament or by parliament, this remarkable sequence of events consolidated the importance of parliament in the English unwritten constitution.', u'Parliament was also crucial in establishing the legitimacy of the king who replaced Edward II: his son Edward III.', u'In 1341 the Commons met separately from the nobility and clergy for the first time, creating what was effectively an Upper Chamber and a Lower Chamber, with the knights and burgesses sitting in the latter.', u'This Upper Chamber became known as the House of Lords from 1544 onward, and the Lower Chamber became known as the House of Commons, collectively known as the Houses of Parliament.', u'The authority of parliament grew under Edward III; it was established that no law could be made, nor any tax levied, without the consent of both Houses and the Sovereign.', u"This development occurred during the reign of Edward III because he was involved in the Hundred Years' War and needed finances.", u'During his conduct of the war, Edward tried to circumvent parliament as much as possible, which caused this edict to be passed.', u'The Commons came to act with increasing boldness during this period.', u"During the Good Parliament (1376), the Presiding Officer of the lower chamber, Sir Peter de la Mare, complained of heavy taxes, demanded an accounting of the royal expenditures, and criticised the king's management of the military.", u"The Commons even proceeded to impeach some of the king's ministers.", u'The bold Speaker was imprisoned, but was soon released after the death of Edward III.', u'During the reign of the next monarch, Richard II, the Commons once again began to impeach errant ministers of the Crown.', u'They insisted that they could not only control taxation, but also public expenditure.', u'Despite such gains in authority, however, the Commons still remained much less powerful than the House of Lords and the Crown.', u'This period also saw the introduction of a franchise which limited the number of people who could vote in elections for the House of Commons.', u'From 1430 onwards, the franchise was limited to Forty Shilling Freeholders, that is men who owned freehold property worth forty shillings or more.', u'The Parliament of England legislated the new uniform county franchise, in the statute 8 Hen.', u'6, c. 7.', u'The Chronological Table of the Statutes does not mention such a 1430 law, as it was included in the Consolidated Statutes as a recital in the Electors of Knights of the Shire Act 1432 (10 Hen.', u'6, c. 2), which amended and re-enacted the 1430 law to make clear that the resident of a county had to have a forty shilling freehold in that county to be a voter there.', u'=== King, Lords, and Commons ===\nIt was during the reign of the Tudor monarchs that the modern structure of the English Parliament began to be created.', u'The Tudor monarchy was powerful and there were often periods of several years when parliament did not sit at all.', u'However the Tudor monarchs were astute enough to realise that they needed parliament to legitimise many of their decisions, mostly out of a need to raise money through taxation legitimately without causing discontent.', u'Thus they consolidated the state of affairs whereby monarchs would call and close parliament as and when they needed it.', u'By the time Henry Tudor (Henry VII) came to the throne in 1485 the monarch was not a member of either the Upper Chamber or the Lower Chamber.', u'Consequently, the monarch would have to make his or her feelings known to Parliament through his or her supporters in both houses.', u'Proceedings were regulated by the presiding officer in either chamber.', u'From the 1540s the presiding officer in the House of Commons became formally known as the "Speaker", having previously been referred to as the "prolocutor" or "parlour" (a semi-official position, often nominated by the monarch, that had existed ever since Peter de Montfort had acted as the presiding officer of the Oxford Parliament of 1258).', u'This was not an enviable job.', u'When the House of Commons was unhappy it was the Speaker who had to deliver this news to the monarch.', u"This began the tradition whereby the Speaker of the House of Commons is dragged to the Speaker's Chair by other members once elected.", u'A member of either chamber could present a "bill" to parliament.', u'Bills supported by the monarch were often proposed by members of the Privy Council who sat in parliament.', u'In order for a bill to become law it would have to be approved by a majority of both Houses of Parliament before it passed to the monarch for royal assent or veto.', u'The royal veto was applied several times during the 16th and 17th centuries and it is still the right of the monarch of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth realms to veto legislation today, although it has not been exercised since 1707 (today such exercise would presumably precipitate a constitutional crisis).', u'When a bill was enacted into law, this process gave it the approval of each estate of the realm: the King, Lords, and Commons.', u'In reality, this was not a democratic process.', u'The Parliament of England was far from being a democratically representative institution in this period.', u'It was possible to assemble the entire peerage and senior clergy of the realm in one place to form the estate of the Upper Chamber.', u'However, the voting franchise for the House of Commons was small; some historians estimate that it was as little as three per cent of the adult male population; and there was no secret ballot.', u'This meant that elections could be controlled by local grandees, because in many boroughs a majority of voters were in some way dependent on a powerful individual, or else could be bought by money or concessions.', u'If these grandees were supporters of the incumbent monarch, this gave the Crown and its ministers considerable influence over the business of parliament.', u'Many of the men elected to parliament did not relish the prospect of having to act in the interests of others.', u'So a law was enacted, still on the statute book today, whereby it became unlawful for members of the House of Commons to resign their seat unless they were granted a position directly within the patronage of the monarchy (today this latter restriction leads to a legal fiction allowing de facto resignation despite the prohibition, but nevertheless it is a resignation which needs the permission of the Crown).', u'However, it must be emphasised that while several elections to parliament in this period were in some way corrupt by modern standards, many elections involved genuine contests between rival candidates, even though the ballot was not secret.', u'It was in this period that the Palace of Westminster was established as the seat of the English Parliament.', u"In 1548, the House of Commons was granted a regular meeting place by the Crown, St Stephen's Chapel.", u'This had been a royal chapel.', u'It was made into a debating chamber after Henry VIII became the last monarch to use the Palace of Westminster as a place of residence and following the suppression of the college there.', u'This room became the home of the House of Commons until it was destroyed by fire in 1834, although the interior was altered several times up until then.', u'The structure of this room was pivotal in the development of the Parliament of England.', u"While most modern legislatures sit in a circular chamber, the benches of the British Houses of Parliament are laid out in the form of choir stalls in a chapel, simply because this is the part of the original room that the members of the House of Commons utilised when they were granted use of St Stephen's Chapel.", u'This structure took on a new significance with the emergence of political parties in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, as the tradition began whereby the members of the governing party would sit on the benches to the right of the Speaker and the opposition members on the benches to the left.', u"It is said that the Speaker's chair was placed in front of the chapel's altar.", u'As Members came and went they observed the custom of bowing to the altar and continued to do so, even when it had been taken away, thus then bowing to the Chair, as is still the custom today.', u'The numbers of the Lords Spiritual diminished under Henry VIII, who commanded the Dissolution of the Monasteries, thereby depriving the abbots and priors of their seats in the Upper House.', u'For the first time, the Lords Temporal were more numerous than the Lords Spiritual.', u'Currently, the Lords Spiritual consist of the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Bishops of London, Durham and Winchester, and twenty-one other English diocesan bishops in seniority of appointment to a diocese.', u'The Laws in Wales Acts of 1535\u201342 annexed Wales as part of England and this brought Welsh representatives into the Parliament of England, first elected in 1542.', u'=== Rebellion and revolution ===\nParliament had not always submitted to the wishes of the Tudor monarchs.', u'But parliamentary criticism of the monarchy reached new levels in the 17th century.', u'When the last Tudor monarch, Elizabeth I, died in 1603, King James VI of Scotland came to power as King James I, founding the Stuart monarchy.', u'In 1628, alarmed by the arbitrary exercise of royal power, the House of Commons submitted to Charles I the Petition of Right, demanding the restoration of their liberties.', u'Though he accepted the petition, Charles later dissolved parliament and ruled without them for eleven years.', u"It was only after the financial disaster of the Scottish Bishops' Wars (1639\u20131640) that he was forced to recall Parliament so that they could authorise new taxes.", u'This resulted in the calling of the assemblies known historically as the Short Parliament of 1640 and the Long Parliament, which sat with several breaks and in various forms between 1640 and 1660.', u'The Long Parliament was characterised by the growing number of critics of the king who sat in it.', u'The most prominent of these critics in the House of Commons was John Pym.', u'Tensions between the king and his parliament reached boiling point in January 1642 when Charles entered the House of Commons and tried, unsuccessfully, to arrest Pym and four other members for their alleged treason.', u'The five members had been tipped off about this, and by the time Charles came into the chamber with a group of soldiers they had disappeared.', u'Charles was further humiliated when he asked the Speaker, William Lenthall, to give their whereabouts, which Lenthall famously refused to do.', u'From then on relations between the king and his parliament deteriorated further.', u'When trouble started to brew in Ireland, both Charles and his parliament raised armies to quell the uprisings by native Catholics there.', u'It was not long before it was clear that these forces would end up fighting each other, leading to the English Civil War which began with the Battle of Edgehill in October 1642: those supporting the cause of parliament were called Parliamentarians (or Roundheads).', u'Battles between Crown and Parliament would continue throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, but parliament was no longer subservient to the English monarchy.', u'This change was symbolised in the execution of Charles I in January 1649.', u'It is somewhat ironic that this event was not instigated by the elected representatives of the realm.', u"In Pride's Purge of December 1648, the New Model Army (which by then had emerged as the leading force in the parliamentary alliance) purged Parliament of members that did not support them.", u'The remaining "Rump Parliament", as it was later referred to by critics, enacted legislation to put the king on trial for treason.', u'This trial, the outcome of which was a foregone conclusion, led to the execution of the king and the start of an 11 year republic.', u'The House of Lords was abolished and the purged House of Commons governed England until April 1653, when army chief Oliver Cromwell dissolved it following disagreements over religious policy and how to carry out elections to parliament.', u"Cromwell later convened a parliament of religious radicals in 1653, commonly known as Barebone's Parliament, followed by the unicameral First Protectorate Parliament that sat from September 1654 to January 1655 and the Second Protectorate Parliament that sat in two sessions between 1656 and 1658, the first session was unicameral and the second session was bicameral.", u'Although it is easy to dismiss the English Republic of 1649-60 as nothing more than a Cromwellian military dictatorship, the events that took place in this decade were hugely important in determining the future of parliament.', u'First, it was during the sitting of the first Rump Parliament that members of the House of Commons became known as "MPs" (Members of Parliament).', u'Second, Cromwell gave a huge degree of freedom to his parliaments, although royalists were barred from sitting in all but a handful of cases.', u'His vision of parliament appears to have been largely based on the example of the Elizabethan parliaments.', u'However, he underestimated the extent to which Elizabeth I and her ministers had directly and indirectly influenced the decision-making process of her parliaments.', u'He was thus always surprised when they became troublesome.', u'He ended up dissolving each parliament that he convened.', u'Yet it is worth noting that the structure of the second session of the Second Protectorate Parliament of 1658 was almost identical to the parliamentary structure consolidated in the Glorious Revolution Settlement of 1689.', u'In 1653 Cromwell had been made head of state with the title Lord Protector of the Realm.', u'The Second Protectorate Parliament offered him the crown.', u'Cromwell rejected this offer, but the governmental structure embodied in the final version of the Humble Petition and Advice was a basis for all future parliaments.', u'It proposed an elected House of Commons as the Lower Chamber, a House of Lords containing peers of the realm as the Upper Chamber, and a constitutional monarchy, subservient to parliament and the laws of the nation, as the executive arm of the state at the top of the tree, assisted in carrying out their duties by a Privy Council.', u'Oliver Cromwell had thus inadvertently presided over the creation of a basis for the future parliamentary government of England.', u'In 1657 he had the Parliament of Scotland unified with the English Parliament.', u'In terms of the evolution of parliament as an institution, by far the most important development during the republic was the sitting of the Rump Parliament between 1649 and 1653.', u'This proved that parliament could survive without a monarchy and a House of Lords if it wanted to.', u'Future English monarchs would never forget this.', u'Charles I was the last English monarch ever to enter the House of Commons.', u'Even to this day, a Member of the Parliament of the United Kingdom is sent to Buckingham Palace as a ceremonial hostage during the State Opening of Parliament, in order to ensure the safe return of the sovereign from a potentially hostile parliament.', u'During the ceremony the monarch sits on the throne in the House of Lords and signals for the Lord Great Chamberlain to summon the House of Commons to the Lords Chamber.', u'The Lord Great Chamberlain then raises his wand of office to signal to the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, who has been waiting in the central lobby.', u'Black Rod turns and, escorted by the doorkeeper of the House of Lords and an inspector of police, approaches the doors to the chamber of the Commons.', u"The doors are slammed in his face \u2013 symbolising the right of the Commons to debate without the presence of the Queen's representative.", u'He then strikes three times with his staff (the Black Rod), and he is admitted.', u'=== Parliament from the Restoration to the Act of Settlement ===\nThe revolutionary events that occurred between 1620 and 1689 all took place in the name of parliament.', u'The new status of parliament as the central governmental organ of the English state was consolidated during the events surrounding the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660.', u'Following the death of Oliver Cromwell in September 1658, his son Richard Cromwell succeeded him as Lord Protector, summoning the Third Protectorate Parliament in the process.', u'When this parliament was dissolved following pressure from the army in April 1659, the Rump Parliament was recalled at the insistence of the surviving army grandees.', u'This in turn was dissolved in a coup led by army general John Lambert, leading to the formation of the Committee of Safety, dominated by Lambert and his supporters.', u"When the breakaway forces of George Monck invaded England from Scotland where they had been stationed\u2014without Lambert's supporters putting up a fight\u2014Monck temporarily recalled the Rump Parliament and reversed Pride's Purge by recalling the entirety of the Long Parliament.", u'They then voted to dissolve themselves and call new elections, which were arguably the most democratic for 20 years although the franchise was still very small.', u'This led to the calling of the Convention Parliament which was dominated by royalists.', u'This parliament voted to reinstate the monarchy and the House of Lords.', u'Charles II returned to England as king in May 1660.', u'The Anglo-Scottish parliamentary union that Cromwell had established was dissolved in 1661 when the Scottish Parliament resumed its separate meeting place in Edinburgh.', u'The Restoration began the tradition whereby all governments looked to parliament for legitimacy.', u'In 1681 Charles II dissolved parliament and ruled without them for the last four years of his reign.', u'This followed bitter disagreements between the king and parliament that had occurred between 1679 and 1681.', u'Charles took a big gamble by doing this.', u'He risked the possibility of a military showdown akin to that of 1642.', u'However he rightly predicted that the nation did not want another civil war.', u'Parliament disbanded without a fight.', u'Events that followed ensured that this would be nothing but a temporary blip.', u'Charles II died in 1685 and he was succeeded by his brother James II.', u'During his lifetime Charles had always pledged loyalty to the Protestant Church of England, despite his private Catholic sympathies.', u'James was openly Catholic.', u'He attempted to lift restrictions on Catholics taking up public offices.', u'This was bitterly opposed by Protestants in his kingdom.', u'They invited William of Orange, a Protestant who had married Mary, daughter of James II and Anne Hyde to invade England and claim the throne.', u'William assembled an army estimated at 15,000 soldiers (11,000 foot and 4000 horse) and landed at Brixham in southwest England in November, 1688.', u"When many Protestant officers, including James's close adviser, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, defected from the English army to William's invasion force, James fled the country.", u'Parliament then offered the Crown to his Protestant daughter Mary, instead of his son (James Francis Edward Stuart).', u"Mary refused the offer, and instead William and Mary ruled jointly, with both having the right to rule alone on the other's death.", u'As part of the compromise in allowing William to be King\u2014called the Glorious Revolution\u2014Parliament was able to have the 1689 Bill of Rights enacted.', u'Later the 1701 Act of Settlement was approved.', u'These were statutes that lawfully upheld the prominence of parliament for the first time in English history.', u'These events marked the beginning of the English constitutional monarchy and its role as one of the three elements of parliament.', u'=== Union: the Parliament of Great Britain ===\n\nFollowing the Treaty of Union in 1707, Acts of Parliament passed in the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland created a new Kingdom of Great Britain and dissolved both parliaments, replacing them with a new Parliament of Great Britain based in the former home of the English parliament.', u'The

however, some media still reported this sequence long after the criminal trial.', u'==== Cabey shot on the fifth shot ====\n"Speed is everything," Goetz said in a videotaped statement made after he surrendered nine days later.', u'He told police that while still seated, he planned a "pattern of fire" from left to right.', u'He then stood, stepped clear of Canty, drew his revolver, turned back to Canty, and fired four shots, one at each man, then fired a fifth shot.', u'At the civil trial years later he said, "I was trying to get as many of them as I could."', u"Other sources repeated Goetz's statements to New York City police as to the sequence of shots: Canty was shot first, then Allen, then Ramseur, then Cabey.", u'In the related proceeding People v. Goetz, the New York Court of Appeals summarized the incident:\n\nIt appears from the evidence before the Grand Jury that Canty approached Goetz, possibly with Allen beside him, and stated "Give me five dollars."', u'Neither Canty nor any of the other youths displayed a weapon.', u'Goetz responded by standing up, pulling out his handgun, and firing four shots in rapid succession.', u"The first shot hit Canty in the chest; the second struck Allen in the back; the third went through Ramseur's arm and into his left side; the fourth was fired at Cabey, who apparently was then standing in the corner of the car, but missed, deflecting instead off of a wall of the conductor's cab.", u'After Goetz briefly surveyed the train scene around him, he fired another shot at Cabey, who then was sitting on the end bench of the car.', u"The bullet entered the rear of Cabey's side and severed his spinal cord.", u'According to his statements to police, Goetz checked the first two men to make sure that they had been "taken care of," then, seeing that the fourth man was now sitting down and seemed unhurt, said, "You seem to be all right, here\'s another," and fired at him again.', u'That the fourth man, Cabey, was shot only once was a fact not made known to Goetz or his attorneys until shortly before the trial.', u'One bullet missed, fragmenting on the steel cab wall behind Cabey.', u'(The missed shot would also be the basis of a charge of reckless endangerment of other passengers.)', u'==== Cabey shot on the fourth shot ====\nAt the Bronx civil trial Goetz testified the first shot was Canty, Allen second, the third shot missed, Cabey fourth, and Ramseur fifth.', u"The following similar shooting sequence is from Bernie Goetz's website:\n\nI decided to shoot as many as I could as quickly as I could.", u'I did a fast draw, and shot with one hand (my right), pulling the trigger prior to the gun being aligned on the targets.', u'All actual shots plus my draw time occurred easily within 1.6 seconds or less.', u'This is not as difficult to do as some might think, and occasionally I give a description of the technique along with a re-enactment.', u'The first shot hit Canty in the center of the chest.', u'After the first shot my vision changed and I lost my sense of hearing.', u'The second shot hit lightning fast Barry Allen in the upper rear shoulder as he was ducking (later the bullet was removed from his arm).', u'The third shot hit the subway wall just in front of Cabey; the fourth shot hit Cabey in the left side (severing his spinal cord and rendering him paraplegic).', u"The fifth shot hit Ramseur's arm on the way into his left side.", u'I immediately looked at the first two to make sure they were "taken care of," and then attempted to shoot Cabey again in the stomach, but the gun was empty.', u"I thought Cabey was shot twice after reading a media account no shots missed; I had lost count of the shots and while under adrenaline I didn't even hear the shots or feel the kick of the gun.", u"'You don't look too bad, here's another', is a phrase I came up with later when trying to explain the shooting while I was under the impression that Cabey was shot twice.", u'Cabey, who was briefly standing prior to the shooting, was sitting on the subway bench during all attempted shots.', u'The others were standing.', u'Shortly after the shooting my vision and hearing returned to normal.', u'Goetz does a shooting demonstration (five shots in 1.0 seconds) on the Biography Channel show Aftermath with William Shatner.', u"==== Time magazine's theory (April 8, 1985) ====\nGoetz said one of the boys made gestures that may have implied he had a weapon.", u'He rose and partly unzipped his jacket where the revolver was concealed, and plotted his "pattern of fire" for shooting them.', u'He asked Canty what he had said, and he repeated his statement.', u'At this Goetz unzipping his jacket the rest of the way, drew the gun, and shot Canty, hitting him in the center of the body.', u'He then turned to shoot Allen, who had tried to flee, hitting him in the back, and then shot Ramseur, wounding him in the chest and arm.', u'He then shot again, at Cabey, but may have missed.', u'According to Goetz he then approached Cabey and shot him on the ground; however another witness disputed that Goetz shot Cabey a second time.', u'=== Cabey and the "here\'s another" issue ===\nCabey ended up slumped in the short seat in the corner of the car next to the conductor\'s cab.', u"Whether Cabey was struck by the fourth shot or by the fifth was critical to Goetz's claim of self-defense; this issue was fiercely contested at trial.", u"Medical testimony said that such an injury would render the lower half of Cabey's body instantly useless.", u'According to the prosecution, the fourth shot missed; then Goetz shot a seated Cabey at point-blank range with the fifth.', u'The defense theory of how Cabey ended up in the seat was that he was standing when hit by the fourth shot, then collapsed into the seat due to the lurching and swaying of the train; with the fifth shot being the shot that missed.', u"A summary of Goetz's statements to the police had become public two months after the incident, drawing intense media coverage.", u'Probably most damaging to Goetz\'s public support and to his claim of acting in self-defense was his statement that he had said, "You don\'t look so bad, here\'s another," before firing at Cabey a second time.', u"Media concentration on the summary's more damning portions created a public mindset that a wounded Cabey was shot a second time, with the second shot taken in a premeditated and deliberate way\u2014an impression that stood uncorrected until the criminal trial two years later.", u'Eleven years later, at least one city newspaper (The New York Times) was still reporting as fact that Cabey was shot twice.', u'At trial, one witness testified that Goetz approached to within "two to three feet" of a seated Cabey, then demonstrated how Goetz stood directly in front of Cabey and fired downward, a description that matched Goetz\'s published statements.', u'Eight other independent witnesses testified that all shots came in "rapid succession"; one of these said the firing lasted "about a second".', u'None of the eight heard a pause before the final shot, and none saw Goetz standing in front of Cabey.', u'Whether Goetz actually said aloud the words "You don\'t look so bad, here\'s another" or only thought them is still a matter of dispute.', u'He has subsequently denied on several occasions making the statement.', u'One source said, "In all probability, the defendant uttered these words only to himself and probably not even mouthing the words, but just saying them in his own mind as he squeezed the trigger that fifth time."', u'=== Flight and surrender ===\nThe terrified passengers ran to the other end and out of the car, leaving behind the two women who had been closest to the shooting, fallen or knocked down by the exodus, and immobilized by fear.', u'Goetz talked to them to make sure they were not injured, then was approached by the conductor of the train.', u'Goetz stated, "They tried to rob me."', u'The conductor asked whether Goetz was a police officer, receiving the reply, "No."', u'Some time after a brief conversation in which he refused to hand over his revolver, Goetz jumped to the tracks and ran south through the tunnel to the Chambers Street station, where he exited the system.', u'He went home to gather some belongings, then rented a car and drove north to Bennington, Vermont, where he burned his blue jacket and dismantled the revolver, scattering the pieces in the woods north of town.', u'He drove around New England for several days, registering at motels under various names and paying in cash.', u"On 26 December, an anonymous hotline caller told New York City police that Goetz matched the gunman's description, owned a gun, and had been mugged previously.", u'On December 29, Goetz called his neighbor, Myra Friedman, who told him that police had come by his apartment looking for him, and had left notes asking to be contacted as soon as possible.', u"He gave his side of the story to Friedman, and described his psychological state at the time:\nMyra, in a situation like this, your mind, you're

u'=== Statements to police ===\nOnce the officer realized that Goetz was a genuine suspect, Goetz was given a Miranda warning and he waived his right to have an attorney present.', u'After an interview that lasted over an hour, a Concord detective asked Goetz to consent to making an audiotaped statement.', u'Goetz agreed, and a two-hour statement was recorded.', u'That evening, New York City detectives and an assistant district attorney arrived in Concord, and Goetz submitted to a two-hour videotaped interview.', u'Both interviews were eventually played back for the grand juries, the criminal trial, and a civil trial years later.', u'When the audiotape was first played in open court, Goetz was described by The New York Times as "confused and emotional, alternately horrified by and defensive about his actions, and obsessed with justifying them."', u'In his statements, Goetz described his past mugging, in which he was injured and the only assailant arrested went unpunished.', u'He called New York City "lawless" and expressed contempt for its justice system, calling it a "joke," a "sham," and "a disgrace".', u'Goetz said that when the four men he shot surrounded him on the train, he feared being "beaten to a pulp" as well as being robbed.', u'He denied any premeditation for the shooting, something that had been speculated on by the press.', u'Asked what his intentions were when he drew his revolver, Goetz replied, "My intention was to murder them, to hurt them, to make them suffer as much as possible."', u'Later in the tape, Goetz said, "If I had more bullets, I would have shot \'em all again and again.', u'My problem was I ran out of bullets."', u'He added, "I was gonna, I was gonna gouge one of the guys\' [Canty\'s] eyes out with my keys afterwards", but

Goetz, reversed Judge Crane's dismissal, affirming the prosecutor's charge to the grand jury that a defendant's subjective belief that he is in imminent danger does not by itself justify the use of deadly force.", u'The court agreed with the prosecutor that an objective belief, one that would be shared by a hypothetical reasonable person, is also required.', u"The appeals court further held that Judge Crane's opinion that the testimony of Canty and Ramseur was perjurious was speculative and inappropriate.", u'All charges were reinstated, and the case was sent to trial.', u'== Trials ==\n\n\n=== Criminal trial ===\nThe case was defended by Barry Slotnick and Mark M.

of the seven major Prussian clans fell under the control of the less numerous Teutonic Knights.', u'However, the Prussians rose against their conquerors on five occasions.', u'The first uprising was supported by Duke Swietopelk II, Duke of Pomerania.', u'The Prussians were successful at first, reducing the Knights to only five of their strongest castles.', u'Conversely, the duke suffered a series of military defeats and was eventually forced to make peace with the Teutonic Knights.', u"With Duke Swietopelk's support for the Prussians broken, a prelate of Pope Innocent IV then negotiated a peace treaty between the Prussians and the Knights.", u'However, this treaty was never honored or enforced, especially after the Battle of Kr\xfccken at the end of 1249.', u'The second uprising, known in historiography as "The Great Prussian Uprising", was prompted by the 1260 Battle of Durbe, the largest defeat suffered by the Teutonic Knights in the 13th century.', u'This uprising was the longest, largest, and most threatening to the Teutonic Order, who again were reduced to five of their strongest castles.', u'Reinforcements for the Knights were slow to arrive, despite repeated encouragements from Pope Urban IV, and the position of the Order looked set to worsen.', u'Luckily for the Order, the Prussians lacked unity and a common strategy and reinforcements finally reached Prussia in around 1265.', u'One by one, Prussian clans surrendered and the uprising was ended in 1274.', u'The later three lesser uprisings depended on foreign help and were suppressed within one or two years.', u'The last uprising in 1295 effectively ended the Prussian Crusade and Prussia became a Christian German-speaking territory, which assimilated native Prussians and a number of settlers from different German states.', u'== Background ==\nAlthough the Prussians repelled early incursions by the Order of Dobrzy\u0144, they were outnumbered by attacks from Poland, Russians in the southeast and the Teutonic Knights from the west.', u'The Teutonic Order was called to the Culmerland (Che\u0142mno Land) in 1226 by Konrad I of Masovia, who started a number of attacks and crusades against the Prussians and later asked the Knights to protect him from retaliatory raids by the Prussians.', u'Preoccupied with crusades in the Holy Land, the Teutonic Knights arrived only in 1230.', u'Their first task was to build a base on the left bank of Vistula at Vogelsang, opposite of Toru\u0144 (Thorn), which was completed a year later.', u'Led by Hermann Balk, the Knights did not repeat the mistakes of the previous Order and did not push eastwards into the forest of the interior.', u'They would further build fortified log (later brick and stone) castles along major rivers and the Vistula Lagoon to serve as basis for future expansion.', u'In 1231\u20131242, forty such castles were built.', u'The Prussians faced major difficulties in capturing these castles as they were accustomed only to battling in open fields.', u'Most conflicts occurred either in summer or winter.', u'Heavily-armoured knights could not travel and fight on land soaked by water from melting snow or autumn rains.', u'Summer campaigns were most dangerous as the Knights would immediately build new castles in the conquered territory.', u"The Teutonic Knight's strategy proved successful: in ten years, five of the seven major Prussian clans fell under control of the less-numerous Teutonic Knights.", u'However, the Prussians further resisted the conquerors, leading to five uprisings over the following fifty years.', u'== The First Prussian Uprising (1242\u20131249) ==\n\nThe First Prussian Uprising was influenced by three major events.', u'Firstly, the Teutonic Knights lost the Battle of the Ice on Lake Peipus to Alexander Nevsky in April 1242.', u'Secondly, southern Poland was devastated by a Mongol invasion in 1241; Poland lost the Battle of Legnica and the Teutonic Knights lost one of its most trusted allies that often supplied troops.', u"Thirdly, Duke Swantopolk II of Pomerania was fighting against the Knights, who supported his brothers' dynastic claims against him.", u'It has been implied that the new castles of the Knights were competing with his lands over the trade routes along the Vistula River.', u'While some historians embrace the Swantopolk\u2013Prussian alliance without hesitation, others are more careful.', u'They point out that the historical information came from documents written by the Teutonic Knights and must have been ideologically charged to persuade the Pope to declare a crusade not only against the pagan Prussians but also against the Christian duke.', u'Prussians besieged Teutonic castles and managed to capture all except for Elbing (Elbl\u0105g) and Balga in the eastern regions of Natangia, Barta and Warmia; Thorn (Toru\u0144), Culm (Che\u0142mno), and Rehden (Radzy\u0144 Che\u0142mi\u0144ski) in the western parts.', u"In December 1242, the Knights were able to capture Sartowice, Swantopolk's castle on the banks of the Vistula.", u'The ensuing five-week siege of Sartowice failed to recapture the fortress and Swantopolk lost 900 men.', u'In the spring of 1243, Swantopolk also lost the castle at Nakel (Nak\u0142o nad Noteci\u0105), which dominated trade on the Note\u0107 River.', u'In the face of these losses, the duke was forced to make short-lived truce.', u'In the summer of 1243, Prussians with Sudovian help raided the Culmerland (Che\u0142mno Land) and, on their way back, defeated the pursuing Teutonic Knights on June 15 on the banks of the Osa River.', u'Some 400 Teutonic soldiers perished, including their marshal.', u'Swantopolk, encouraged by the defeat, gathered an army of 2,000 men and unsuccessfully besieged Culm (Che\u0142mno).', u'The Teutonic Knights managed to gather a coalition against Swantopolk: Dukes of Masovia were given territories in Prussia, Dukes of Greater Poland received Nakel, and Dukes of Pomerellia, brothers of Swantopolk, hoped to regain their inheritance.', u'Swantopolk built a castle at Zantyr, where Nogat separated from the Vistula, and launched a blockade of Elbing and Balga.', u'While the castle withstood Teutonic attacks, the blockade was smashed by cogs.', u"In late 1245 Swantopolks's army suffered a great defeat at S(ch)wetz \u015awiecie, and another one in early 1246, where 1,500 Pomeranians were killed.", u'Swantopolk II asked for truce and Pope Innocent IV appointed his chaplain, Jacob of Li\xe8ge, the future Pope Urban IV, to handle the peace negotiations.', u'However, the war was renewed in 1247 when large Teutonic reinforcements arrived in Prussia.', u'On Christmas Eve of 1247 the Knights besieged and overwhelmed a major Pomesanian fortress, which they later renamed Christburg (Dzierzgo\u0144), and newly arrived Henry III, Margrave of Meissen subdued the Pogesanians.', u'Swantopolk retaliated and destroyed Christburg, but the Knights rebuilt it in a new location.', u"Both Prussian and Swantopolk's armies failed to capture the new castle.", u'Otto III of Brandenburg raided Warmia and Natangia forcing the locals to surrender.', u'The peace talks that begun in 1247 achieved little, but a new truce was arranged in September 1248 and peace was made on November 24, 1248.', u'Swantopolk had to return lands seized from his brothers, allow Teutonic Knights to pass through his domains, stop charging tolls on ships using the Vistula, and stop any aid to the Prussians.', u'Prussians were compelled to sign the Treaty of Christburg on February 7, 1249.', u'The treaty provided personal freedom and rights to newly converted Christians.', u'It formally ended the uprising, but already in November 1249 the Natangians defeated the Knights at the Battle of Kr\xfccken.', u'The skirmishes lasted until 1253 and some sources cite this year as the end of the uprising.', u'At that point the treaty ceased its political power but remained an interesting historical document.', u'== The Great Prussian Uprising (1260\u20131274) ==\n\n\n=== Preparation and tactics ===\nThe major revolt began on September 20, 1260.', u'It was triggered by the Lithuanian and Samogitian military victory against the joint forces of the Livonian Order and Teutonic Knights in the Battle of Durbe.', u'As the uprising was spreading through Prussian lands, each clan chose a leader: the Sambians were led by Glande, the Natangians by Herkus Monte, the Bartians by Diwanus, the Warmians by Glappe, the Pogesanians by Auktume.', u'One clan that did not join the uprising was the Pomesanians.', u'The uprising was also supported by Skalmantas, leader of the Sudovians.', u'However, there was no one leader to coordinate efforts of these different forces.', u'Herkus Monte, who was educated in Germany, became the best known and most successful of the leaders, but he commanded only his Natangians.', u'The Prussians besieged the many castles that the Knights had built and could not send large armies to fight in the west.', u'Prussians were not familiar with Western European siege tactics and machinery and relied on siege forts, built around the castle, to cut the supplies to the garrisons.', u'The Teutonic Knights could not raise large armies to deliver supplies to the starving garrisons and smaller castles began to fall.', u'Those castles were usually destroyed and the Prussians manned just a few castles, notably one in Heilsberg (Lidzbark Warmi\u0144ski), because they lacked technology to defend the captured castles and organization to provide food and supplies to stationed garrisons.', u'On August 29, 1261 Jacob of Li\xe8ge, who negotiated the Treaty of Christburg after the first uprising, was elected as Pope Urban IV.', u'He, having an inside scope on events in Prussia, was especially favourable to the Teutonic Knights and issued 22 papal bulls in three years of his papacy calling for reinforcements to the Knights.', u'However, the reinforcements were slow to come as dukes of Poland and Germany were preoccupied with their own disputes and the Livonian Order was fighting the Semigallian uprising.', u'=== Early Prussian success ===\n\nThe first reinforcement to the Teutonic forces arrived in early 1261, but was wiped out on January 21, 1261 by Herkus Monte in the Battle of Pokarwis.', u'In January 1262 reinforcements arrived from the Rhineland, led by Wilhelm VII, Duke of J\xfclich, who was obliged by Pope Alexander IV to fulfil his crusader duties in Prussia.', u'This army broke the Siege of K\xf6nigsberg but as soon as the army returned home, the Sambians resumed the siege and were reinforced by Herkus Monte and his Natangians.', u'Herkus was later injured and the Natangians retreated, leaving the Sambians unable to stop supplies reaching the castle and the siege eventually failed.', u'Prussians were more successful capturing castles deeper into the Prussian territory (with an exception of Wehlau, now Znamensk), and the Knights were left only with strongholds in Balga, Elbing, Culm, Thorn, and K\xf6nigsberg.', u'Most castles fell in 1262\u20131263, and Bartenstein fell in 1264.', u'The Prussians destroyed captured forts instead of using them for their own defence, so the end of successful sieges meant that large Prussian forces did not have to stay near their home and were then free to operate in other parts of Prussia, raiding the Culmerland and Kuyavia.', u'A recovered Herkus Monte raided Culmerland with a large force and took many prisoners in 1263.', u'On his way back to Natangia, Herkus and his men were confronted by a contingent of their enemies.', u'In the Battle of L\xf6bau that ensued, Prussians killed forty knights, including the Master and the Marshal.', u'The Prussians also received help from Lithuanians and Sudovians.', u'In summer of 1262 Treniota and Shvarn attacked Masovia, killing Duke Siemowit I, and raided Culmerland, provoking Pogesanians to join the uprising.', u'However, assassination of Mindaugas and subsequent dynastic fights prevented Lithuanians from further campaigns.', u'Skalmantas, leader of Sudovians, raided Culm (Che\u0142mno) in 1263 and in 1265.', u'=== Turning point ===\n\nThe year of 1265 was the turning point in the uprising: more substantial reinforcements for the Teutonic Knights finally started arriving in Prussia and Sambia gave up the fight.', u'Teutonic castles in K\xf6nigsberg and Wehlau on the Pregel River cut off the region from the rest of Prussia.', u'Supplies to K\xf6nigsberg were brought by sea, and the castle served as the basis for raids in surrounding Samland (Sambia).', u'The Livonian Order sent troops to K\xf6nigsberg and the joint forces defeated the Sambians in a decisive battle forcing them to surrender.', u'In 1265 reinforcements arrived from Germany: armies of Duke Albrecht of Braunschweig and Margrave Albert of Meissen arrived in Prussia, but were unable to achieve much.', u'In 1266 Otto III and John I, co-rulers of Brandenburg, built a castle in the Natangian lands between Balga and K\xf6nigsberg and named it Brandenburg (since 1945 Ushakovo).', u'Due to bad weather they did not organize campaigns into Prussian lands.', u'When the Dukes returned home, Brandenburg was captured by Glappe and his Warmians.', u'The very next year Otto returned to rebuild the castle.', u"However, both John and Otto died before the end of 1267, and Otto's son was killed in a tournament.", u'Subsequent Dukes of Brandenburg were not as supportive of the Knights.', u'In 1266 Duke Swantopolk, the supporter of the Prussians during the First Uprising, died and his sons Mestwin and Warcis\u0142aw briefly joined the Prussians in the uprising.', u'In 1267 King Ottokar II of Bohemia, who already participated in the Prussian Crusade in 1254 and who was promised by Pope Urban IV all Prussian lands he could conquer, finally arrived in Prussia.', u'His only achievement was forcing Duke Mestwin to reconcile with the Teutonic Knights.', u'His large army was unable to campaign due to an early thaw: heavily armed knights could hardly fight during the wet and swampy spring season.', u'The warfare with the Prussians relied on guerilla raids in the border regions.', u'Small groups of men, a dozen to a hundred, made quick raids on farms, villages, border posts, etc.', u'This was a positional warfare where neither side could defeat the other, but the Teutonic Knights relied on future reinforcements from Germany and Europe, while Prussians were draining their local resources.', u'After the massacre of surrendered Teutonic soldiers in the Battle of Kr\xfccken in 1249, the Knights refused to negotiate with the Prussians.', u'The Prussians were also unable to coordinate their efforts and develop a common strategy: while each clan had its own leader, there was no one to lead all the clans.', u'The Natangians had to watch for attacks from Balga, Brandenburg, Wehlau, and K\xf6nigsberg while the Warmians were threatened by garrisons at Christburg and Elbing.', u'This way only Diwane and his Bartians were able to continue the war in the west.', u'They made several minor expeditions to Culmerland each year.', u'=== The end of the uprising ===\n\nThe major Prussian offensive was organized in 1271 together with Linka, leader of the Pogesanians.', u'The Bartian infantry and Pogesanians besieged a border castle, but were fended off by the Knights from Christburg.', u'The Prussians who managed to escape joined their cavalry while the Knights set up a camp on the opposite bank of the Dargune River (Dzierzgo\u0144 River), blocking the route home.', u'When Christians retired for the night, one half of the Prussian army crossed the river in a distance, in order to attack the Knights from the rear, while the other half charged straight across the river.', u'The Knights were encircled.', u'The Battle of Paganstin saw twelve

{'sentences': [u'Thomas Becket (/\u02c8b\u025bk\u026at/; also known as Saint Thomas of Canterbury, Thomas of London, and later Thomas \xe0 Becket; 21 December c. 1119 (or 1120) \u2013 29 December 1170) was Archbishop of Canterbury from 1162 until his murder in 1170.', u'He is venerated as a saint and martyr by both the Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion.', u'He engaged in conflict with Henry II, King of England over the rights and privileges of the Church and was murdered by followers of the king in Canterbury Cathedral.', u'Soon after his death, he was canonised by Pope Alexander III.', u'== Sources ==\nThe main sources for the life of Becket are a number of biographies that were written by contemporaries.', u'A few of these documents are by unknown writers, although traditional historiography has given them names.', u'The known biographers are John of Salisbury, Edward Grim, Benedict of Peterborough, William of Canterbury, William fitz Stephen, Guernes of Pont-Sainte-Maxence, Robert of Cricklade, Alan of Tewkesbury, Benet of St Albans, and Herbert of Bosham.', u'The other biographers, who remain anonymous, are generally given the pseudonyms of Anonymous I, Anonymous II (or Anonymous of Lambeth), and Anonymous III (or Lansdowne Anonymous).', u'Besides these accounts, there are also two other accounts that are likely contemporary that appear in the Quadrilogus II and the Th\xf3mas saga Erkibyskups.', u"Besides these biographies, there is also the mention of the events of Becket's life in the chroniclers of the time.", u"These include Robert of Torigni's work, Roger of Howden's Gesta Regis Henrici Secundi and Chronica, Ralph Diceto's works, William of Newburgh's Historia Rerum, and Gervase of Canterbury's works.", u'== Early life ==\n\nBecket was born about 1119, or in 1120 according to later tradition.', u'He was born in Cheapside, London, on 21 December, which was the feast day of St Thomas the Apostle.', u"He was the son of Gilbert Beket and Gilbert's wife Matilda.", u"Gilbert's father was from Thierville in the lordship of Brionne in Normandy, and was either a small landowner or a petty knight.", u'Matilda was also of Norman ancestry, and her family may have originated near Caen.', u'Gilbert was perhaps related to Theobald of Bec, whose family also was from Thierville.', u'Gilbert began his life as a merchant, perhaps as a textile merchant, but by the 1120s he was living in London and was a property owner, living on the rental income from his properties.', u'He also served as the sheriff of the city at some point.', u"They were buried in Old St Paul's Cathedral.", u"One of Becket's father's wealthy friends, Richer de L'Aigle, often invited Thomas to his estates in Sussex where Becket was exposed to hunting and hawking.", u'According to Grim, Becket learned much from Richer, who was later a signatory of the Constitutions of Clarendon against Thomas.', u"Beginning when he was 10, Becket was sent as a student to Merton Priory in England and later attended a grammar school in London, perhaps the one at St Paul's Cathedral.", u'He did not study any subjects beyond the trivium and quadrivium at these schools.', u'Later, he spent about a year in Paris around age 20.', u'He did not, however, study canon or civil law at this time and his Latin skill always remained somewhat rudimentary.', u'Some time after Becket began his schooling, Gilbert Beket suffered financial reverses, and the younger Becket was forced to earn a living as a clerk.', u'Gilbert first secured a place for his son in the business of a relative \u2013 Osbert Huitdeniers \u2013 and then later Becket acquired a position in the household of Theobald of Bec, by now the Archbishop of Canterbury.', u'Theobald entrusted him with several important missions to Rome and also sent him to Bologna and Auxerre to study canon law.', u"Theobald in 1154 named Becket Archdeacon of Canterbury, and other ecclesiastical offices included a number of benefices, prebends at Lincoln Cathedral and St Paul's Cathedral, and the office of Provost of Beverley.", u'His efficiency in those posts led to Theobald recommending him to King Henry II for the vacant post of Lord Chancellor, to which Becket was appointed in January 1155.', u"As Chancellor, Becket enforced the king's traditional sources of revenue that were exacted from all landowners, including churches and bishoprics.", u"King Henry even sent his son Henry to live in Becket's household, it being the custom then for noble children to be fostered out to other noble houses.", u'The younger Henry was reported to have said Becket showed him more fatherly love in a day than his father did for his entire life.', u'== Primacy ==\nBecket was nominated as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1162, several months after the death of Theobald.', u'His election was confirmed on 23 May 1162 by a royal council of bishops and noblemen.', u'Henry may have hoped that Becket would continue to put the royal government first, rather than the church.', u'However, the famous transformation of Becket into an ascetic occurred at this time.', u'Becket enthroned as Archbishop of Canterbury from a Nottingham Alabaster in the Victoria & Albert Museum\n\nBecket was ordained a priest on 2 June 1162 at Canterbury, and on 3 June 1162 was consecrated as archbishop by Henry of Blois, the Bishop of Winchester and the other suffragan bishops of Canterbury.', u'A rift grew between Henry and Becket as the new archbishop resigned his chancellorship and sought to recover and extend the rights of the archbishopric.', u'This led to a series of conflicts with the King, including that over the jurisdiction of secular courts over English clergymen, which accelerated antipathy between Becket and the king.', u'Attempts by Henry to influence the other bishops against Becket began in Westminster in October 1163, where the King sought approval of the traditional rights of the royal government in regard to the church.', u"This led to Clarendon, where Becket was officially asked to agree to the King's rights or face political repercussions.", u'== Constitutions of Clarendon ==\n\nKing Henry II presided over the assemblies of most of the higher English clergy at Clarendon Palace on 30 January 1164.', u'In sixteen constitutions, he sought less clerical independence and a weaker connection with Rome.', u'He employed all his skills to induce their consent and was apparently successful with all but Becket.', u'Finally, even Becket expressed his willingness to agree to the substance of the Constitutions of Clarendon, but he still refused to formally sign the documents.', u"Henry summoned Becket to appear before a great council at Northampton Castle on 8 October 1164, to answer allegations of contempt of royal authority and malfeasance in the Chancellor's office.", u'Convicted on the charges, Becket stormed out of the trial and fled to the Continent.', u"Henry pursued the fugitive archbishop with a series of edicts, targeting Becket as well as all of Becket's friends and supporters; but King Louis VII of France offered Becket protection.", u"He spent nearly two years in the Cistercian abbey of Pontigny, until Henry's threats against the order obliged him to return to Sens.", u'Becket fought back by threatening excommunication and interdict against the king and bishops and the kingdom, but Pope Alexander III, though sympathising with him in theory, favoured a more diplomatic approach.', u'Papal legates were sent in 1167 with authority to act as arbitrators.', u'In 1170, Alexander sent delegates to impose a solution to the dispute.', u'At that point, Henry offered a compromise that would allow Thomas to return to England from exile.', u"== Assassination ==\nIn June 1170, Roger de Pont L'\xc9v\xeaque, the archbishop of York, along with Gilbert Foliot, the Bishop of London, and Josceline de Bohon, the Bishop of Salisbury, crowned the heir apparent, Henry the Young King, at York.", u"This was a breach of Canterbury's privilege of coronation, and in November 1170 Becket excommunicated all three.", u'While the three clergymen fled to the king in Normandy, Becket continued to excommunicate his opponents in the church, the news of which also reached Henry.', u"Upon hearing reports of Becket's actions, Henry is said to have uttered words that were interpreted by his men as wishing Becket killed.", u"The king's exact words are in doubt and several versions have been reported.", u'The most commonly quoted, as handed down by oral tradition, is "Who will rid me of this troublesome priest?', u'", but according to historian Simon Schama this is incorrect: he accepts the account of the contemporary biographer Edward Grim, writing in Latin, who gives us "What miserable drones and traitors have I nourished and brought up in my household, who let their lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low-born cleric?"', u'Many variations have found their way into popular culture.', u'Whatever Henry said, it was interpreted as a royal command, and four knights, Reginald FitzUrse, Hugh de Morville, William de Tracy and Richard le Breton, set out to confront the Archbishop of Canterbury.', u'On 29 December 1170 they arrived at Canterbury.', u'According to accounts left by the monk Gervase of Canterbury and eyewitness Edward Grim, they placed their weapons under a tree outside the cathedral and hid their mail armour under cloaks before entering to challenge Becket.', u'The knights informed Becket he was to go to Winchester to give an account of his actions, but Becket refused.', u"It was not until Becket refused their demands to submit to the king's will that they retrieved their weapons and rushed back inside for the killing.", u'Becket, meanwhile, proceeded to the main hall for vespers.', u'The four knights, wielding drawn swords, caught up with him in a spot near a door to the monastic cloister, the stairs into the crypt, and the stairs leading up into the quire of the cathedral, where the monks were chanting vespers.', u'Several contemporary accounts of what happened next exist; of particular note is that of Edward Grim, who was himself wounded in the attack.', u'This is part of the account from Edward Grim:\n\nThe wicked knight leapt suddenly upon him, cutting off the top of the crown which the unction of sacred chrism had dedicated to God.', u'Next he received a second blow on the head, but still he stood firm and immovable.', u'At the third blow he fell on his knees and elbows, offering himself a living sacrifice, and saying in a low voice, "For the name of Jesus and the protection of the Church, I am ready to embrace death."', u'But the third knight inflicted a terrible wound as he lay prostrate.', u'By this stroke, the crown of his head was separated from the head in such a way that the blood white with the brain, and the brain no less red from the blood, dyed the floor of the cathedral.', u"The same clerk who had entered with the knights placed his foot on the neck of the holy priest and precious martyr, and, horrible to relate, scattered the brains and blood about the pavements, crying to the others, 'Let us away, knights; this fellow will arise no more.", u'Another account can be found in Expugnatio Hibernica ("Conquest of Ireland", 1189) written by Gerald of Wales.', u"== After Becket's death ==\n\nFollowing Becket's death, the monks prepared his body for burial.", u"According to some accounts, it was discovered that Becket had worn a hairshirt under his archbishop's garments\u2014a sign of penance.", u"Soon after, the faithful throughout Europe began venerating Becket as a martyr, and on 21 February 1173\u2014little more than two years after his death\u2014he was canonised by Pope Alexander III in St Peter's Church in Segni.", u"In 1173, Becket's sister Mary was appointed as abbess of Barking Abbey as reparation for the murder of her brother.", u"On 12 July 1174, in the midst of the Revolt of 1173\u201374, Henry humbled himself with public penance at Becket's tomb as well as at the church of St. Dunstan's, which became one of the most popular pilgrimage sites in England.", u"Becket's assassins fled north to Knaresborough Castle, which was held by Hugh de Morville, where they remained for about a year.", u'De Morville held property in Cumbria and this may also have provided a convenient bolt-hole, as the men prepared for a longer stay in the separate kingdom of Scotland.', u'They were not arrested and neither did Henry confiscate their lands, but he failed to help them when they sought his advice in August 1171.', u'Pope Alexander excommunicated all four.', u'Seeking forgiveness, the assassins travelled to Rome and were ordered by the Pope to serve as knights in the Holy Lands for a period of fourteen years.', u'This last also inspired Knights of Saint Thomas, incorporated in 1191 at Acre, and which was to be modelled on the Teutonic Knights.', u'It is the only military order native to England (with chapters in not only Acre, but London, Kilkenny, and Nicosia), like the Gilbertine Order being the only monastic order native to England as well.', u'Nevertheless, Henry VIII dissolved both of these English institutions upon passing the Reformation, rather than merging foreign orders with them and nationalising them as elements of the Protestant Church of England.', u"The monks were afraid that Becket's body might be stolen.", u"To prevent this Becket's remains were placed beneath the floor of the eastern crypt of the cathedral.", u'A stone cover was placed over the burial place with two holes where pilgrims could insert their heads and kiss the tomb; this arrangement is illustrated in the "Miracle Windows" of the Trinity Chapel.', u'A guard chamber (now called the Wax Chamber) had a clear view of the grave.', u"In 1220, Becket's bones were moved to a new gold-plated and bejewelled shrine behind the high altar in the Trinity Chapel.", u'The shrine was supported by three pairs of pillars, placed on a raised platform with three steps.', u'This is also illustrated in one of the miracle windows.', u'Canterbury, because of its religious history, had always seen a large number of pilgrims.', u'However, after the death of Thomas Becket, the number of pilgrims visiting the city rose rapidly.', u"== Cult in the Middle Ages ==\n\nOn 7 July 1220, in the 50th jubilee year of his death, Becket's remains were moved from this first tomb to a shrine, in the recently completed Trinity Chapel.", u'This act of translation was "one of the great symbolic events in the life of the medieval English Church" and was attended by King Henry III, the papal legate, the Archbishop of Canterbury Stephen Langton and large numbers of dignitaries and magnates secular and ecclesiastical.', u'Thus a "major new feast day was instituted, commemorating the translation, that was celebrated each July almost everywhere in England and also in many French churches."', u'This feast was suppressed in 1536 at the Reformation.', u'The shrine stood until it was destroyed in 1538, during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, on orders from King Henry VIII.', u"The king also destroyed Becket's bones and ordered that all mention of his name be obliterated.", u"As the scion of the leading mercantile dynasty of later centuries, Mercers, Becket was very much regarded as a Londoner by the citizens and was adopted as London's co-patron saint with St Paul: both their images appeared on the seals of the city and of the Lord Mayor.", u'The Bridge House Estates seal used only the image of Becket, while the reverse featured a depiction of his martyrdom.', u'Local legends regarding Becket arose after his canonisation.', u"Though they are typical hagiographical stories, they also display Becket's particular gruffness.", u'"Becket\'s Well", in Otford, Kent, is said to have been created after Becket had become displeased with the taste of the local water.', u'Two springs of clear water are said to have bubbled up after he struck the ground with his crozier.', u'The absence of nightingales in Otford is also ascribed to Becket, who is said to have been so disturbed in his devotions by the song of a nightingale that he commanded that none should sing in the town ever again.', u'In the town of Strood, also in Kent, Becket is said to have caused the inhabitants of the town and their descendants to be born with tails.', u"The men of Strood had sided with the king in his struggles against the archbishop, and to demonstrate their support, had cut off the tail of Becket's horse as he passed through the town.", u"The saint's fame quickly spread throughout the Norman world.", u'The first holy image of Becket is thought to be a mosaic icon still visible in Monreale Cathedral, in Sicily, created shortly after his death.', u"Becket's cousins obtained refuge at the Sicilian court during his exile, and King William II of Sicily wed a daughter of Henry II.", u'The principal church of the Sicilian city of Marsala is dedicated to St Thomas Becket.', u"Over forty-five medieval chasse reliquaries decorated in champlev\xe9 enamel showing similar scenes from Becket's life survive, including the Becket Casket, originally constructed to hold relics of the saint at Peterborough Abbey, and now housed in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.", u'In Scotland, King William the Lion ordered the building of Arbroath Abbey in 1178.', u'On completion in 1197 the new foundation was dedicated to Becket, whom the king had known personally while at the English court as a young man.', u"== Legacy ==\n\nGeoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales is set in a company of pilgrims on their way from Southwark to the shrine of St Thomas Becket in Canterbury Cathedral.", u"The story of Becket's life became a popular theme for the medieval Nottingham Alabaster carvers.", u'One set of Becket panels is displayed in the Victoria and Albert Museum.', u"In 1884, England's poet laureate Alfred, Lord Tennyson wrote Becket, a play about Thomas Becket and Henry II.", u"Henry Irving produced the play after Tennyson's death, and was celebrated in the title role.", u"Modern works based on the story of Thomas Becket include T.
