\chapter{Introduction}
        \section{The Problem}
        Nominal data is descriptive in nature, making is difficult to assign an canonical ordering to.
        
        The problem tackled in this disertation is the ordering of news article headlines to generate
        a most-probable traversal of a weighted directed graph of these events.

        The problem originally propsed for this disertation was the ordering of news article headlines
        to generate a most-probable traversal of a weighted directed graph of these events. The project
        has been modified from this original proposal to use fetched article data to attempt to derive
        context to improve ordering estimation.

        This problem is inspired by the paper \cite{abend2015lexical} and some
        techniques discussed and used henseforth are based off of this paper.


        Our data comes from the Wikipedia ``Today in History'' dataset and the article data is retrived
        from wikipedia articles.

        \section{Aims \& Objectives}
        The aim of this project is to construct a system that predics the most probable path
        through an edge-weighted directional graph of events.
        We aim to constuct this graph by extracting data from wikipedia for each event and
        build a date estimate from wikipedia. From this data we will conduct several experiments
        to find the most likely spanning path across the generated graphs.


        \noindent The core aims of the project were: 
            \begin{itemize}
            \item Investivage the usefulness of wikipedia text in feature generation
            \item Generate probable dates For each event
            \item Order these events linearly
            \end{itemize}

        \noindent The further goals of the project were to:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Generate edge-weighted directional graphs of the data
          \item Construct probabilities of maximum spanning walks through the graph
        \end{itemize}

        \noindent Aspects of the project still to be looked at include:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item The use of word embeddings
          \item Improved data extraction from article data
        \end{itemize}

        \section{Testing \& Evaluation}
        With our dataset being so large, 6226 entries, it can
        easily be split into training, devlopment and testing with no
        need for overlap. For this the data is split 10\% training,
        10\% development and 80\% for testing.


        %Think this section might need some work
        Evaulation of the system was done using the Kendall rank correlation coefficient (Kendall Tau)
        as  is a statistic used to measure the ordinal association between two
        measured quantities. This was easy be applied to our results
        by compairing the systems estimated date for each event
        with the label associated with the event from the data.

\chapter{Wikipedia As a Data Source}

        \section{Subject Extraction}
        Stanfords natural language processing (NLP) suite,
        a natural language analysis toolkit,
        was selected to aid in extraction of features from the dataset.

        Using this toolkit, the Open Domain Information Extraction (OpenIE) system
        based on research from Washington Univeristy \cite{angeli2015leveraging}.

        Open IE refers to the extraction of relation tuples, with the advantage of not requiring a
        specified schema in advance. Relation names are typically just the text linking two arguments.

        %Make this look nicer
        As an example of OpenIE's extraction, the sentence:\\
        \begin{center}
        ``The U.S. president Barack Obama gave his speech on Tuesday to thousands of people.''\\
        \end{center}
        Will produce these potential binary relations\\
        \begin{center}
        ``president(Barack Obama, the U.S.)''\\
        ``gave(Barack Obama,his speech)''\\
        ``gave-speech(Barack Obama, on Tuesday)''\\
        ``gave-speech(Barack Obama, to thousands of people)''\\
        \end{center}


        OpenIE was choosen as it allows us to easiy model the relationship within the article headline
        and ealisy identify subjects and objects for article retrieval about.

        \section{Text Retrieval} %More??
        Using Wikipedia's article retrieval API, gathering whole articles from
        the site is trivial. Choosing what to extract is, however, not
        so straightforward

        While it was simple to retireve the data, there was simply too much noise to be of use.
        So it was required to minimise the moise.

        For this we look at each article and only retain information that is self referening, contains
        a date or references the other article subject.
        This method allowed us to cut down the text retained from each article from 600 words \cite{WikiStats}
        to 300 words, on average. %These numbers are not quite right
        We now have much smaller article data to allow us to generate features.


        \section{Feature Extraction}
                Choosing which type of feature extraction method to use for our data provided several challanges.
                \begin{itemize}
                \item How to model the data as feature vectors
                \item Which type of feature would be most appropriate
                \end{itemize}

                %Given the data set contains a title and year for each entry and we are looking to graph
                %which entry comes before the other, it was dicded to experiment with features
                %NEED TO EXPLAIN HOW CWE PICKEd WHAT A FEATURE WAS
                \noindent Given that each event in out dataset is of the form $(t_{i},d_{i}) $for $ i \epsilon [M]$,
                where t is the title, d is the associated date and M is the original dataset,
                we constructed a new dataset $\{(t_{i},s_{i},d_{j})\}$ for $i,j [M]$ containing
                the sentences retrieved from wikipedia. This will form the basis of our data to generate
                features.

                From this we built a new dataset $\{(t_{i},s_{i},t_{j},s_{j},b_{ij})\}$ for $i,j \epsilon [M]$
                where $b_{ij} = [y_{i} > y_{j}]$ indicating which event came first.

                With this new dataset, we will explore feature extraction techniques to train a classifier
                on the provided sentences.
