\frametitle{Suggestions (III)}
\begin{itemize}
\item If the title does not fit in the footer box, it is possible to exploit the so called \highlight{shorttitle}; an example:
\begin{verbatim}
\title[short title]{Long title of the thesis}
\end{verbatim}
In this way the long title is just placed in the titlepage.
\item In case there are more than two supervisors or assistansupervisors, I suggest you to insert them through commands reported in \ref{secondrel} and separate names thanks to a comma.
\end{itemize}
