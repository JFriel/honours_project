\chapter{Introduction}
The problem this thesis is a similar problem to that tackled
in \cite{abend2015lexical}. While this paper deals with ordering
of instructions related to cooking, the underlying theory
is similar for this thesis.
\section{The Problem}
%The problem explored within this thesis is that of graphing nature.
%Building a most probable path through each node in an edge-weighted directed graph
%, each node beinga single sentence describing an event from history.
%Examples of these events include:
%\say{Julian claendar begins at Greenwich mean noon}
%and \say{AT\&T broken up into 8 countries}

\section{Aims \& Objectives}
The aim of this thesis is to construct a system that predics the most probable path
through an edge-weighted directional graph of events.
we aim to constuct this graph by extracting data from wikipedia for each event and
buld a date estimate from wikipedia. From this data we will conduct several experiments
to maximise the likelyhood of a graph traversal.
